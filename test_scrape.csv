"The Board Game at the Heart of Viking Culture&gt;An ancient game known as “hnefatafl” held immense symbolic and religious significance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Over the past 150 years, excavators have unearthed large quantities of gaming material from Viking boat burials. Dating from the 7th to the 11th centuries, most of it consists of checker-like pieces constructed from glass, whale bone, or amber. These pieces range from ordinary discs to ornate figurines and are usually uniform in shape and size, save for one prominent king piece, known as the hnefi. The archaeologist Mark Hall recently chronicled the contents of 36 burials containing such pieces in a 2016 article for *The European Journal of Archaeology*. This material, he says, indicates the game was much more than a frivolous way to kill time between raids. “Its presence in these burials suggests it was an aspect of everyday life that was desirable to see continued,” he says, as well as “a significant element that helped define the status of the deceased.”

Yeah, but what's its BGG rank? /s

"Thoughts on 'deluxe' as the new 'normal'To quote from the current Kickstarter for [Emperor's Choice](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaelmindes/emperors-choice-deluxified-edition?ref=BGGcontest):

&gt;You may have noticed that we do not have a Retail edition of Emperor’s  Choice as a pledge option. Tasty Minstrel Games started Deluxifying  their games with the release of Orleans in 2015. Since then, we  have  continued to give Kickstarter Backers the option to enjoy our games with  upgraded components, and this has worked very well for both us and our  customers.   
&gt;  
&gt;However, we have seen the Board Game industry change from  an era when satisfactory components and presentation were commonplace  into a time where Deluxe games are now becoming the new “normal”. We see  this and recognize it, and that is why for this release we offering  only a fantastically upgraded Deluxe version of Emperor’s Choice. **However,** **because of the higher cost of these games, we expect there to be far fewer copies than normal present in retail** **stores, and for any future printings to also require crowdfunding.** 

So, I acknowledge that when I say this bothers me a little, it's a classic old-man-yells-at-clouds moment. There's a lot of reasons why Tasty Minstrel would choose this approach, especially in regards to a Kickstarter project where aesthetics and component quality is a common way of trying to rise above the white noise of new projects. If I were more skeptical I'd wonder if the wording hints at creating an intentional sense of scarcity, but if the decision makes financial sense to them and backers aren't pissed off, I won't nag about it.

But as someone with a tight board game budget, the notion of 'deluxe' becoming the new 'normal' does bother me. I wonder whether people really do feel that way outside of regular Kickstarter backers. And I wonder whether companies deciding to adopt this mentality will artificially accelerate that trend, if it does exist outside of big-ticket 'crowdfunding'. It's a notion that could cut away options for people like me, who can't justify spending premium prices for a game that can and has been done at a fraction of the price.

Am I being paranoid or is this something worth discussing?",boardgames,t3_djjiij

"Pandemic: Rapid Response - A lesson in personal space for players and forgiving the flaws of tabletop games.When I nabbed Kane Klenko’s first entry into the Pandemic series, I expected panic induced gameplay, co-operative conundrums and another box to include in my ever growing Pandemic mosaic that’ll soon ingulf the wall. What I didn’t expect was for it to teach me just how important a player’s space is when it comes to real time dice rollers, something I had only really thought about in terms of dexterity games.  


Pandemic: Rapid Response is a real time dice roller that comes with the cities, the cubes and the unique roles of its series’ namesake, but plays over the course of several 2 minute rounds, with players rolling dice to generate resources needed to offset a humanitarian crisis rather than tackle a worldwide case of the sniffles.  


Each player takes a pawn, places it in a room on the Rapid Response team’s dedicated support aircraft and flips the timer. In 2 minutes, players must roll 6 of their dice to jump between rooms, move closer to cities in need of aid, deliver aid to those cities or lock in their dice to create those supplies people are desperately crying out for. Help a city by delivering all its supplies and you earn another 2 minutes. Clear all the cities (the number of which is determined by difficulty level at the start of the game) and you win.  


It’s easy to think of yourself the hero, luck be damned and lock in dice to create supplies as swiftly as you possibly can for the good of humanity. But you’re no hero. You’re part of a team of humans, and those dice translate to your stamina. Locking them into supply slots are all well and good, but if you’re not at the right stage to activate a room and get those dice back, your future turns are completely useless when your pool of dice is edging closer to 0.  


You can’t do this alone. You need your teammates as much as they need you, and if you can’t communicate effectively with one another, you’ll end up wasting time. Time that the world does not have.

The mental gymnastics of tough choices and clear comms is to be expected from a great co-op game, but Rapid Response has to consider another element when it comes to how to handle panic: your physicality.

Playing RR with folks, newcomers especially, can occasionally end up with dice flailing, cubes launching, knuckles clashing and pawns rolling into storage rooms filled with syringes. Add this to the upkeep you have to do every time you successfully activate a room: adding supplies ready for distribution, rerolling the dice to see if waste - an unhelpful defeat mechanic - is generated, making sure everyone gets their dice back, discarding the saved city and adding a time token that grants you an extra round to the board. It’s a large amount of upkeep in high pressure circumstances that makes the area feel constrained.  


Co-op real time dice rollers aren’t anything new. Klenko’s premiere entry in the genre is Fuse, a game where you also dive in to grab dice whilst ignoring others and screwing yourself and your team over in the process. But it feels a lot smoother, all the while being just as tense as Rapid Response thanks to the real estate each player is given. Whilst each player in Fuse has to work with just 2 cards, Rapid Reponse players have to coordinate across a thin board, with multiple components that aren’t dice that can roll over in the heat of the moment.  


Yes, you could say the frenzy that occurs in Rapid Response that causes a team to upend components is all part of the frenetic nature of the game, but since when has cleaning up after others on a Ryanair flight been fun?  


These should be glaring flaws. And yet every time I’ve played this, with the experienced or newcomers, players have immediately wanted to play Rapid Response again, either to tackle it on a higher difficulty or because they’re beating themselves up because they could’ve been more coordinated, not in their planning, but in maneuvering around a messy board.  


It has played a trick on all of us. Its' flaws have become its strength. To those unaware, they get an enjoyable twenty minutes of tension. And for those who clock onto it, it’s still a joy that forces them to reconsider when an issue actually becomes fundamentally problematic.  


If Rapid Response is going for dice rolling dominance, it has failed. But I don’t think it was shooting for that. I think it was trying to get newcomers trying new things thanks to having the Pandemic brand emblazoned on the cover.

The series as become a beacon of dependable gaming for people coming into the hobby, erasing grainy memories of Monopoly infighting and scraps over Scrabble. Nowadays when I mention board games, instead of drearily moaning about remembering those ‘fun’ times, now recount trying out more recent games and finding them a joy. A frequent one of those is Pandemic.  


The same people who may be deterred by hearing about high pressure games played in real time may be swayed into trying something that is part of a series that has become a mainstay that brings people together in order to attain victory, rather than turn against each other for a solitary win. The series that has reframed the hobby for some may now be ready to find new genres for those newly initiated to delve into and explore what tabletop games have to offer. Rapid Response feels like the first step in that process.

And that, no matter the ‘flaws’, might be its greatest success.This review is an excerpt from my [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WEeUrE8a98) originally posted on [Dicey Exploits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx5bnIbrSmGsFFhJ9C6SeCg).",boardgames,t3_dj7t6c

It's a simple tabletop game which can be played by 2-4 people during the weekends. Mix this game up with little bit of alcohol and/or good food and you have a perfect escape from all the problems.. well at least for a few hours.",boardgames,t3_dj5yya
"Question about Coup challenges.So I play Coup quite often at work and we had a situation come up that caused much disagreement between players.  
  
Here's the situation:  
Three players: A, B, &amp; C.

Player A ""assassinates"" Player B, but Player C is holding two Assassin cards, and one has been revealed already, so Player C knows for a fact that Player A is lying.  
  
Player C immediately challenges Player A's Assassin, and Player B has not said anything yet.  
  
My question:  
How does this situation get resolved?  
  
The problem is this:  
Normally Player B would have three options: Claim Contessa, Challenge Assassin, Take the hit. However, at this point Player C has challenged Player A already, and if we resolve that challenge before proceeding, that isn't really fair for Player A, because Player B would be able to make a decision about what to do based on information he otherwise would not have had.  
  
My solution was this:  
Player B must declare an action (Claim Contessa, Challenge Assassin, Take the hit) **before** Player C's challenge is resolved.  
  
Then, Player C's challenge is resolved, followed by whatever action that Player B decided to take.

"Where to get custom cards made?Hello Boardgamers and more specifically designers,

I have been trying to find a place to make low quantity (\~500 or 10 sets of 8 with some instructions) custom cards.

I have found a lot of places that do standard playing cards, however I was after a larger size. That's when my love of board games came to mind, they have all kinds of fancy cutomness about them.

So why am I asking here you say? Well, I am hoping someone has prototyped a game with cards. My requirements seemed to match that of a board game designer. Custom(but one of the many standard card sizes for board games), custom front, custom back, high quality and not a large amount of each. 

I am not confident in places I have found online, especially as I have no experience in them, therefore I am hoping to get some community recommendations.

I wish it was for my own boardgame but unfortunately just need the same type of cards :(...one day maybe it will be.

"COMC - a recent convert to the wonderful world of board games[https://imgur.com/a/YolMofF](https://imgur.com/a/YolMofF)

Hi folks - bit of a lurker but first time poster... hope this link works...

**How long have you been in the hobby?**

I’ve only seriously started getting into board gaming in the past few months (when the majority of these games were bought). Like many people, for most of my life my knowledge of board games extended to Monopoly, Scrabble etc. The seeds for playing more engaging/interesting board games were planted a few years ago when I first played **A Game of Thrones**. A friend of mine introduced me, and I was hooked immediately (big fan of the books) - to the point where I bought the game almost straight away, and swatted up on the rulebook so that the next few times we played I was pointing out all the rules they’d been getting wrong. What a joy I must have been. Those friends moved away in the end (for what I can only assume were unrelated reasons) and over the next couple of years I would sporadically try to get different groups (mostly non-gamers) together to play the game, but it was always a challenge (game length, rules explanation, the backstabby elements etc.). In that time I’d also bought **Pandemic** and **Mysterium** and quite enjoyed those, but neither particularly grabbed me or made me want to delve much deeper into the hobby.

Somewhat out of the blue, my girlfriend bought me **Raptor** (lovely 2 player game) for Christmas last year. I really enjoyed it but she wasn’t too keen. Then a couple of friends who I'd started playing D&amp;D with casually mentioned this game called Evolution (and specifically **Evolution: Climate**). The concept was enough to pique my interest, and it wasn’t long after looking that game up that I came across BGG, SU&amp;SD, Watch It Played, and the plethora of games out there just waiting to be discovered… I went ahead and bought Evolution: Climate. Then **Evolution: Flight**. Then more and more games came onto my radar and eventually led to the collection I now have. I mostly play 2 players so a lot of these were bought with my partner in mind (so far she’s loved **7 Wonders Duel**, **Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective** and **Fog of Love**). It’s been trickier to get other people together for 3/4 player games, but I’m working on it.

What I have is still a pretty modest collection, but most of these were accumulated in a few months and I’ve promised myself (and my girlfriend) that I won’t be buying any more games this year – I really want to enjoy and make the most of what I have so far. (Although I already have my wishlist for next year in mind…)

**What would I change about my collection if I could?**

Early on I think I rushed with a couple of my purchases. **Ticket To Ride** and **Tiny Epic Galaxies** are not particularly interesting to me compared to the other games, so can’t see them getting to the table anytime soon. I’ve been more diligent with my research since, and I really enjoy the other games I have. I haven’t managed to get **Sons of Anarchy** to the table (I’ve heard it’s a great game but the theme is kinda niche).

Other than that I’d like to get my hands on some more co-op (and even solo) games next year. On my wishlist in particular is **Robinson Crusoe** and **This War Of Mine**. I’m also looking at expansions to what I already have – so perhaps **Pantheon** for 7WD, the Fog of Love or **Villainous** expansions, that kind of thing. I also watched a recent playthrough of **Jaws** and it looks right up my street.

**Favourite games**

My favourite games I own generally pull me in through some combination of engaging theme, interesting mechanics and attractive visuals. Evolution: Climate is at the top for those very reasons. Also high up on my list are - **Alien Legendary Encounters** (great theme, really fun to teach, this is a popular one with friends too), **Everdell** (looks gorgeous, love the card combos and the feeling of building your city) and **Legendary Creatures** (I don’t hear too much about this one – lots of interesting decisions about how to use your cards and, again, really visually appealing.)

**Newest games**

Everdell and **Duelosaur Island** are the last 2 I added. Haven’t gotten round to Duelosaur Island yet but I'm thoroughly enjoying Everdell. **Fox in the Forest** is also relatively new – and terrific.

Just a note to say what a great community this is – I’m also relatively new to Reddit but it’s been fun to see other people’s collections and hear views on so many different games. Keep being rad.",boardgames,t3_dj47hk

"Best bags for over-sized sleeved cards? e.g. Coup (65x100mm) and Ninja Burger (70x120mm)?As title.

I've sleeved all my games (Master of Orion, Coup, Ninja Burger, Good Critters, and Bunny Kingdom) and I am concerned about buying a bag that won't fit the games with oddly shaped cards such as Coup and NB.

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with bagging these types of games? Once I've sleeved them they won't fit in their boxes without removing the inserts and I figure I might as well save some time and put them all in one bag instead of hauling boxes to game nights.

"What boardgame that you were excited for disappointed you the most?As I work through my boardgame collection trading and selling what I no longer play or have time for to make space for new games I look sadly upon two colossal failures of my expectations - Ghostbusters and Dark Souls.

Ghostbusters is one of my all time favorite franchises and when a boardgame from a larger publisher was announced and the Kickstarter appeared to show the game as a near duplicate of Zombicide I was excited. I already enjoyed Zombicide and thought despite being a bit random there was enough under the hood that strategy mattered.

I jumped in at the highest tier for Ghostbusters even adding additional tiles and minis so that I had the absolute most complete copy I would. My first worry came after demoing the game at GenCon and finding the experience to be even more random than Zombicide but I was content to chalk that up it being a demo and early version. My second worry was the colossal issue that came in shipping with huge delays and packaging problems.

When the day arrived and the game showed up I was stoked. It looked great! The models were what I had expected, the tiles had good detail, and the presentation overall was good. After reading the rules though it all came crashing down. The entirety of the game, everything, was driven by the randomness of the dice and there was no way to mitigate anything. After playing I learned that you would win and lose purely on how your dice came up since every proton stream was a roll and every ghost movement was a roll. Worse, each mission was essentially in a timer as you tried to close gates!

Sadly, I fell for buying in completely for the sequel with promises that the game had been fixed and new equipment cards being show. Alas, it did not fix it and the game remained as simple as as random as before. It's too bad that I sunk about $600 into the two editions combined and will never see anything close to my money back if I trade or sell it.

Dark Souls lured me in with beautiful minis and a promise to mimic the game. It copied the game too well and decided that grinding the same 3-4 rooms with the same enemies for hours while receiving random loot upgrades would be a good idea. To this day I am still waiting for items from the Kickstarter to ship after buying in on everything.",boardgames,t3_dj0bhs

"Running board game meetup groups?Running a general meetup group for introducing people to board games can hit a few snags, like &gt;60% of people planning to attend being no-shows.

The easier to control side is coming up with a semi-curated list of games that are decently fun, don't require 30 minutes to explain, and ideally are not prone to leading people into analysis paralysis as it can be a table of 4 new people learning the ropes &amp; the 5th knowing the game.

"Help me remember a gameThe name of this game is escaping me.  I believe it's a fairly well known title.  I believe it's jungle themed.  It has a modular board.  Not sure if the board it laid out in its entirety at the beginning of the game or if it's revealed as the game progresses.  You are moving a meeple on the board trying to get to a goal tile.  There are different types of tiles that have different movement restrictions and requirements.

Games that I know it is not:

* Archipelago
* Escape: The Curse of the Temple

"Impressions of The City - Race-For-The-Galaxy-Lite finally gets an English edition**Genesis**

Once upon a time, did designer Andreas Seyarth create a board game, and he did name it [Puerto Rico](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3076/puerto-rico) (2002). And it was good. So good, in fact, that it was even at the top of the BoardGameGeek rankings for many times and half a time.  Then in 2007 there came forth from designer Thomas Lehmann and Puerto Rico an offspring made of cards, which he did name [Race for the Galaxy](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy). And it was also good. So good, in fact, that from it were begotten several expansions, and thousands of fans.

But the goodness was not yet finished. Nor would it be overcome by the multitudes of other games that were birthed by other designers. Thus in 2011 did Thomas Lehmann conceive yet another card game, and he did name it The City. It was the offspring of Race for the Galaxy, and much lighter than its father, but it, too, was good. But its mother was the publisher Amigo, and it spoke only German, while many of the peoples did speak English.  But then did Thomas Lehmann speak with Eagle Gryphon Games, and thus was born an English edition, called [**The City**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/103649/city). And all the peoples rejoiced. And then did I write this review. 

**Overview**

The City strips Race for the Galaxy to its simple core, in a very speedy game for 2-5 players that can be over in as little as 10 minutes. Players are trying to be the first to reach 50 points, and we do that by constructing buildings using the cards in our hand. Your use your cards in multiple ways, either by turning them into buildings, or by using them as currency to pay for your new building's cost. The buildings you have in play will generate income and victory points, and you will want to take advantage of the cards you are dealt, and manage your hand well, by building your city smartly and productively in the race to win. Can you make the right choices that will generate you the income and victory points necessary to win the game that is The City? 

**Impressions**

The basic concept here will be very familiar.  The City is first and foremost a city-building card game, where cards have multiple uses (currency and buildings), and where buildings generate income (in cards) and victory points.  These mechanics will quickly be recognized as a simplified and shorter version of Race for the Galaxy. The heart of the game is about engine-building, benefiting from synergy and combos.

But The City is much easier to learn than its esteemed fathers, so much so that it can even appeal to non-gamers.  It is also very light, with a reasonable amount of luck, and limited player interaction even gives it a multi-player solitaire feel.  But none of this matters because it plays super quick, and a typical game lasts only around 10 minutes.  It manages packs a lot into a small game where there are genuinely interesting decisions.  These qualities also make it the ideal filler game, and you can expect it to be quite addictive, and to play multiple games in a row.

Given how good it is, an English edition has been much demanded, and long overdue.  I'm pleased that this English edition comes to us from Eagle Gryphon Games as part of their [Gryphon Games Bookshelf Series](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/48478/gryphon-games-bookshelf-series-collect-em-all), which now consists of over 20 games.  Besides sharing similar aesthetics, the games in this series are designed to be accessible, playable in a reasonable amount of time, and easily learned and enjoyed by families and non-gamers.   The City is a perfect fit for this series, given that it also ticks all the criteria for being an excellent filler, and is geared to be suited for light and social gaming situations.  

**Expansions**

Along with this new edition also comes a 33 card expansion, entitled [The Expanded City](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/270603/city-expanded-city). The Kickstarter edition also includes a mini-expansion of six extra cards, [Eco expansion](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/291697/city-eco-expansion), which should eventually be available for purchase separately. There's also an [Iconic City Pack](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2278755/washington-seoul-and-paris), which offers cards with alternative artwork featuring half a dozen cards for Washington DC, Seoul, and Paris respectively, which can replace some of the generic cards that come with the base game.

**Recommendation**

The City has a very respected ancestry, and its genetics can clearly traceable back to the extremely popular card game Race for the Galaxy, which is from the same designer. The City is definitely a much simpler game, with significantly less of the strategic depth than its ancestor. But it also plays much more quickly, and offers a very rewarding and fun experience given the short game time of only 10 minutes. It's hard to think of games that can provide an experience to match it in that time-span, and that says a lot.

[**The City**](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/103649/city) will never attain the same heights as Race for the Galaxy, due to its lighter feel. But it does have the real potential to be a big hit, especially now that it is readily available in a quality English edition. Highly recommended!

"[COMC] 4 months into the hobby. I’m felling like my collection is almost there.Been hooked since the end of June, when a friend of mine brought a couple of games over. Prior to that, my experience with table top gaming was mostly Magic the Gathering, a bit of RPG, and Secret Hitler.

I’m proud to say all the games in my collection have multiple plays. I like all of them so far, so there’s nothing I would change just yet.

My favorites are Brass: Birmingham (managed to get a hold of a deluxe copy), Star Wars Rebellion and Secret Hitler (still the most fun for big groups).

"My thoughts on Ticket to ride.Although ticket to ride is supposed to be a great game, I’ve never really understood the appeal.

"My List of 10 Travel Board Games under $25**[Targi – $18.41](https://www.amazon.com/Thames-Kosmos-Targi-Player-Game/dp/B07B7TTRDF/)** - 2 Players – 45-60 mins


An incredible game for two players. It’s a worker placement type of game where you take turns placing your meeples to determine which actions you will perform during one of 16 rounds. You gather one of three resources, trade for coins to purchase cards that will make a display. Arrange said display in specific ways and you’ll score additional points at the end of the game.  

Who knew such a small and compact box could pack so much game into it? It’s great to travel with and a great option if you’re seeking a meaty game.


**[Blue Lagoon – $23.99](https://www.amazon.com/ORANGE-Games-Blue-Lagoon-Strategy/dp/B07F4F8MBD/)** - 2-4 Players, 30-60 mins


Great area control type of game. Each game consists of two rounds, with separate scoring in each round. During the first round players take turns placing workers on the map and expanding your presence on the board while collecting resources scattered throughout. In the first phase you may place your workers &amp; villages anywhere so long as you’re touching either the lagoon or previously played tokens. In the second phase the board is cleared excluding villages and players must take turns expanding from the villages placed in phase 2, while also collecting resources. Scoring occurs at the end, and the player with the most points wins!  


While the box is fairly large, the game can be shrunk down when the insert is taken out. This is a game we often use as a “travel case” because the board is necessary to play. It’s a great game to take on vacation, camping, etc.


**[Love letter – $9.93](https://www.amazon.com/Alderac-Entertainment-Group-Love-Letter/dp/B00AGJ4HC2/)** - 2-8 Players, 10-30 min


Social deception type of game. You take turns figuring out whom is carrying the love letter to the princess, and if you guess correct one collects a block, first to seven blocks (in a two player game) wins the game.  

Smallest footprint of all games, basically 10-20 cards is all is needed to play. Great to bring to a bar and play a round or two while sipping on a drink. Easy to teach and often regarded to as a staple in the board game world.


**[Hive Pocket – $19.69](https://www.amazon.com/Smart-Zone-Games-Hive-Pocket/dp/B0079L0EKY/)** - 2 Players, 15-30 mins


A classic game when traveling. Each person has set tiles which are different bugs, each acting differently. Players take turns either laying down, or moving their respective bug tiles in order to surround your opponents queen bee.  

Interesting mechanics and the small footprint of the game makes it one of the best games to travel with. Very similar to chess, with expansions that can be purchased to add variability if it starts to grow stale.


**[Ticket To Ride: New York – $15.99](https://www.amazon.com/Days-Wonder-DOW720060-Ticket-Multicolour/dp/B07F46X4GY/)** - 2 Players, 15-20 mins


Smaller and much shorter version of ticket to ride in a compact box. Maintains the classic feel, but does run a bit short when playing. Regardless, there is enough variance to keep the game interesting. Small footprint and includes an actual board.


**[Guillotine – $13.99](https://www.amazon.com/Avalon-Hill-5510919-Guillotine/dp/B000ARTT7S/)** - 2-5 Players, 15-20 mins
Fun head to head card game which great art style. Goal is to collect as many nobles which are doomed to get guillotined, utilizing action cards to alter the order of the line to your benefit.  

When travelling we often take the deck of cards in a TCG box. Art style is great and it’s quick and enjoyable enough to bring along.


**[Arboretum – $16.99](https://www.amazon.com/Renegade-Game-Studios-RGS00830-Arboretum/dp/B07CRQ8YHX/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=arboretum&amp;qid=1571233955&amp;sr=8-1)** - 2-4 Players, 30-60 mins


Push your luck card game, which again fits in a . Incredible art style and game play. Cards are utilized to build an “arboretum”, which is scored at game end based on what is left on you and your opponents hand. Requires a solid amount of table space to be played but it’s a very satisfying game to play.


**[Jaipur – $19.08](https://www.amazon.com/Space-Cowboys-JAIP01-Jaipur/dp/B07SRMXRZB/)** - 2 Players, 20-30 mins


Head to head, push your luck type of game, only for 2 players. Cards are played to obtain goods/camels which are turned in for coins. Only enough goods (coins) are depleted, the round ends and the player with the most coin value wins the round, best two out of three rounds wins the game.  

Great components and small enough box that it can be taken when traveling. Small footprint, and a great mind game with perfect length.


**[7 Wonders Duel – $21.94](https://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-SEV07-7-Wonders-Duel/dp/B014DMSTXK/)** - 2 Players, 30-45 mins


An incredible head to head type of game. Take turns grabbing cards in order to complete wonders of the world, trying to find a good combination of card that allows you to take multiple turns at once. Small box which can easily be packed with other games.  

This is often one of our go to games when traveling as it’s the perfect length and I’m often left wanting to play again. We only own the base game, but I have heard incredible things about the expansion.


**[The Lost Expedition – $19.94](https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Expedition-game-survival-Amazon/dp/1472824164/)** - 2 Players, 20-30 mins


Co-op type of game which is a nice twist from typical head to head. Small footprint and unique art style/box which is aesthetically pleasing. Role-playing makes this game incredible and fun to play.

"The Board Game at the Heart of Viking Culture&gt;An ancient game known as “hnefatafl” held immense symbolic and religious significance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Over the past 150 years, excavators have unearthed large quantities of gaming material from Viking boat burials. Dating from the 7th to the 11th centuries, most of it consists of checker-like pieces constructed from glass, whale bone, or amber. These pieces range from ordinary discs to ornate figurines and are usually uniform in shape and size, save for one prominent king piece, known as the hnefi. The archaeologist Mark Hall recently chronicled the contents of 36 burials containing such pieces in a 2016 article for *The European Journal of Archaeology*. This material, he says, indicates the game was much more than a frivolous way to kill time between raids. “Its presence in these burials suggests it was an aspect of everyday life that was desirable to see continued,” he says, as well as “a significant element that helped define the status of the deceased.”

Yeah, but what's its BGG rank? /s

[https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-board-game-at-the-heart-of-viking-culture](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-board-game-at-the-heart-of-viking-culture)",boardgames,t3_dj9ez9
"Thoughts on 'deluxe' as the new 'normal'To quote from the current Kickstarter for [Emperor's Choice](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaelmindes/emperors-choice-deluxified-edition?ref=BGGcontest):

&gt;You may have noticed that we do not have a Retail edition of Emperor’s  Choice as a pledge option. Tasty Minstrel Games started Deluxifying  their games with the release of Orleans in 2015. Since then, we  have  continued to give Kickstarter Backers the option to enjoy our games with  upgraded components, and this has worked very well for both us and our  customers.   
&gt;  
&gt;However, we have seen the Board Game industry change from  an era when satisfactory components and presentation were commonplace  into a time where Deluxe games are now becoming the new “normal”. We see  this and recognize it, and that is why for this release we offering  only a fantastically upgraded Deluxe version of Emperor’s Choice. **However,** **because of the higher cost of these games, we expect there to be far fewer copies than normal present in retail** **stores, and for any future printings to also require crowdfunding.** 

So, I acknowledge that when I say this bothers me a little, it's a classic old-man-yells-at-clouds moment. There's a lot of reasons why Tasty Minstrel would choose this approach, especially in regards to a Kickstarter project where aesthetics and component quality is a common way of trying to rise above the white noise of new projects. If I were more skeptical I'd wonder if the wording hints at creating an intentional sense of scarcity, but if the decision makes financial sense to them and backers aren't pissed off, I won't nag about it.

But as someone with a tight board game budget, the notion of 'deluxe' becoming the new 'normal' does bother me. I wonder whether people really do feel that way outside of regular Kickstarter backers. And I wonder whether companies deciding to adopt this mentality will artificially accelerate that trend, if it does exist outside of big-ticket 'crowdfunding'. It's a notion that could cut away options for people like me, who can't justify spending premium prices for a game that can and has been done at a fraction of the price.

"Pandemic: Rapid Response - A lesson in personal space for players and forgiving the flaws of tabletop games.When I nabbed Kane Klenko’s first entry into the Pandemic series, I expected panic induced gameplay, co-operative conundrums and another box to include in my ever growing Pandemic mosaic that’ll soon ingulf the wall. What I didn’t expect was for it to teach me just how important a player’s space is when it comes to real time dice rollers, something I had only really thought about in terms of dexterity games.  


Pandemic: Rapid Response is a real time dice roller that comes with the cities, the cubes and the unique roles of its series’ namesake, but plays over the course of several 2 minute rounds, with players rolling dice to generate resources needed to offset a humanitarian crisis rather than tackle a worldwide case of the sniffles.  


Each player takes a pawn, places it in a room on the Rapid Response team’s dedicated support aircraft and flips the timer. In 2 minutes, players must roll 6 of their dice to jump between rooms, move closer to cities in need of aid, deliver aid to those cities or lock in their dice to create those supplies people are desperately crying out for. Help a city by delivering all its supplies and you earn another 2 minutes. Clear all the cities (the number of which is determined by difficulty level at the start of the game) and you win.  


It’s easy to think of yourself the hero, luck be damned and lock in dice to create supplies as swiftly as you possibly can for the good of humanity. But you’re no hero. You’re part of a team of humans, and those dice translate to your stamina. Locking them into supply slots are all well and good, but if you’re not at the right stage to activate a room and get those dice back, your future turns are completely useless when your pool of dice is edging closer to 0.  


You can’t do this alone. You need your teammates as much as they need you, and if you can’t communicate effectively with one another, you’ll end up wasting time. Time that the world does not have.

The mental gymnastics of tough choices and clear comms is to be expected from a great co-op game, but Rapid Response has to consider another element when it comes to how to handle panic: your physicality.

Playing RR with folks, newcomers especially, can occasionally end up with dice flailing, cubes launching, knuckles clashing and pawns rolling into storage rooms filled with syringes. Add this to the upkeep you have to do every time you successfully activate a room: adding supplies ready for distribution, rerolling the dice to see if waste - an unhelpful defeat mechanic - is generated, making sure everyone gets their dice back, discarding the saved city and adding a time token that grants you an extra round to the board. It’s a large amount of upkeep in high pressure circumstances that makes the area feel constrained.  


Co-op real time dice rollers aren’t anything new. Klenko’s premiere entry in the genre is Fuse, a game where you also dive in to grab dice whilst ignoring others and screwing yourself and your team over in the process. But it feels a lot smoother, all the while being just as tense as Rapid Response thanks to the real estate each player is given. Whilst each player in Fuse has to work with just 2 cards, Rapid Reponse players have to coordinate across a thin board, with multiple components that aren’t dice that can roll over in the heat of the moment.  


Yes, you could say the frenzy that occurs in Rapid Response that causes a team to upend components is all part of the frenetic nature of the game, but since when has cleaning up after others on a Ryanair flight been fun?

"COMC - a recent convert to the wonderful world of board games[https://imgur.com/a/YolMofF](https://imgur.com/a/YolMofF)

Hi folks - bit of a lurker but first time poster... hope this link works...

**How long have you been in the hobby?**

I’ve only seriously started getting into board gaming in the past few months (when the majority of these games were bought). Like many people, for most of my life my knowledge of board games extended to Monopoly, Scrabble etc. The seeds for playing more engaging/interesting board games were planted a few years ago when I first played **A Game of Thrones**. A friend of mine introduced me, and I was hooked immediately (big fan of the books) - to the point where I bought the game almost straight away, and swatted up on the rulebook so that the next few times we played I was pointing out all the rules they’d been getting wrong. What a joy I must have been. Those friends moved away in the end (for what I can only assume were unrelated reasons) and over the next couple of years I would sporadically try to get different groups (mostly non-gamers) together to play the game, but it was always a challenge (game length, rules explanation, the backstabby elements etc.). In that time I’d also bought **Pandemic** and **Mysterium** and quite enjoyed those, but neither particularly grabbed me or made me want to delve much deeper into the hobby.

Somewhat out of the blue, my girlfriend bought me **Raptor** (lovely 2 player game) for Christmas last year. I really enjoyed it but she wasn’t too keen. Then a couple of friends who I'd started playing D&amp;D with casually mentioned this game called Evolution (and specifically **Evolution: Climate**). The concept was enough to pique my interest, and it wasn’t long after looking that game up that I came across BGG, SU&amp;SD, Watch It Played, and the plethora of games out there just waiting to be discovered… I went ahead and bought Evolution: Climate. Then **Evolution: Flight**. Then more and more games came onto my radar and eventually led to the collection I now have. I mostly play 2 players so a lot of these were bought with my partner in mind (so far she’s loved **7 Wonders Duel**, **Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective** and **Fog of Love**). It’s been trickier to get other people together for 3/4 player games, but I’m working on it.

What I have is still a pretty modest collection, but most of these were accumulated in a few months and I’ve promised myself (and my girlfriend) that I won’t be buying any more games this year – I really want to enjoy and make the most of what I have so far. (Although I already have my wishlist for next year in mind…)

**What would I change about my collection if I could?**

Early on I think I rushed with a couple of my purchases. **Ticket To Ride** and **Tiny Epic Galaxies** are not particularly interesting to me compared to the other games, so can’t see them getting to the table anytime soon. I’ve been more diligent with my research since, and I really enjoy the other games I have. I haven’t managed to get **Sons of Anarchy** to the table (I’ve heard it’s a great game but the theme is kinda niche).

Other than that I’d like to get my hands on some more co-op (and even solo) games next year. On my wishlist in particular is **Robinson Crusoe** and **This War Of Mine**. I’m also looking at expansions to what I already have – so perhaps **Pantheon** for 7WD, the Fog of Love or **Villainous** expansions, that kind of thing. I also watched a recent playthrough of **Jaws** and it looks right up my street.

**Favourite games**

My favourite games I own generally pull me in through some combination of engaging theme, interesting mechanics and attractive visuals. Evolution: Climate is at the top for those very reasons. Also high up on my list are - **Alien Legendary Encounters** (great theme, really fun to teach, this is a popular one with friends too), **Everdell** (looks gorgeous, love the card combos and the feeling of building your city) and **Legendary Creatures** (I don’t hear too much about this one – lots of interesting decisions about how to use your cards and, again, really visually appealing.)

**Newest games**

Everdell and **Duelosaur Island** are the last 2 I added. Haven’t gotten round to Duelosaur Island yet but I'm thoroughly enjoying Everdell. **Fox in the Forest** is also relatively new – and terrific.

Just a note to say what a great community this is – I’m also relatively new to Reddit but it’s been fun to see other people’s collections and hear views on so many different games. Keep being rad.",boardgames,t3_dj47hk

"Best bags for over-sized sleeved cards? e.g. Coup (65x100mm) and Ninja Burger (70x120mm)?As title.

I've sleeved all my games (Master of Orion, Coup, Ninja Burger, Good Critters, and Bunny Kingdom) and I am concerned about buying a bag that won't fit the games with oddly shaped cards such as Coup and NB.

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with bagging these types of games? Once I've sleeved them they won't fit in their boxes without removing the inserts and I figure I might as well save some time and put them all in one bag instead of hauling boxes to game nights.

TIA!

ETA: could also do a box, not sure if the 5k BCWs will play nice with the larger cards, though.",boardgames,t3_djf16j

"The Board Game at the Heart of Viking Culture&gt;An ancient game known as “hnefatafl” held immense symbolic and religious significance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Over the past 150 years, excavators have unearthed large quantities of gaming material from Viking boat burials. Dating from the 7th to the 11th centuries, most of it consists of checker-like pieces constructed from glass, whale bone, or amber. These pieces range from ordinary discs to ornate figurines and are usually uniform in shape and size, save for one prominent king piece, known as the hnefi. The archaeologist Mark Hall recently chronicled the contents of 36 burials containing such pieces in a 2016 article for *The European Journal of Archaeology*. This material, he says, indicates the game was much more than a frivolous way to kill time between raids. “Its presence in these burials suggests it was an aspect of everyday life that was desirable to see continued,” he says, as well as “a significant element that helped define the status of the deceased.”

Yeah, but what's its BGG rank? /s

"Thoughts on 'deluxe' as the new 'normal'To quote from the current Kickstarter for [Emperor's Choice](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaelmindes/emperors-choice-deluxified-edition?ref=BGGcontest):

&gt;You may have noticed that we do not have a Retail edition of Emperor’s  Choice as a pledge option. Tasty Minstrel Games started Deluxifying  their games with the release of Orleans in 2015. Since then, we  have  continued to give Kickstarter Backers the option to enjoy our games with  upgraded components, and this has worked very well for both us and our  customers.   
&gt;  
&gt;However, we have seen the Board Game industry change from  an era when satisfactory components and presentation were commonplace  into a time where Deluxe games are now becoming the new “normal”. We see  this and recognize it, and that is why for this release we offering  only a fantastically upgraded Deluxe version of Emperor’s Choice. **However,** **because of the higher cost of these games, we expect there to be far fewer copies than normal present in retail** **stores, and for any future printings to also require crowdfunding.** 

So, I acknowledge that when I say this bothers me a little, it's a classic old-man-yells-at-clouds moment. There's a lot of reasons why Tasty Minstrel would choose this approach, especially in regards to a Kickstarter project where aesthetics and component quality is a common way of trying to rise above the white noise of new projects. If I were more skeptical I'd wonder if the wording hints at creating an intentional sense of scarcity, but if the decision makes financial sense to them and backers aren't pissed off, I won't nag about it.

But as someone with a tight board game budget, the notion of 'deluxe' becoming the new 'normal' does bother me. I wonder whether people really do feel that way outside of regular Kickstarter backers. And I wonder whether companies deciding to adopt this mentality will artificially accelerate that trend, if it does exist outside of big-ticket 'crowdfunding'. It's a notion that could cut away options for people like me, who can't justify spending premium prices for a game that can and has been done at a fraction of the price.

Am I being paranoid or is this something worth discussing?",boardgames,t3_djjiij

"Pandemic: Rapid Response - A lesson in personal space for players and forgiving the flaws of tabletop games.When I nabbed Kane Klenko’s first entry into the Pandemic series, I expected panic induced gameplay, co-operative conundrums and another box to include in my ever growing Pandemic mosaic that’ll soon ingulf the wall. What I didn’t expect was for it to teach me just how important a player’s space is when it comes to real time dice rollers, something I had only really thought about in terms of dexterity games.  


Pandemic: Rapid Response is a real time dice roller that comes with the cities, the cubes and the unique roles of its series’ namesake, but plays over the course of several 2 minute rounds, with players rolling dice to generate resources needed to offset a humanitarian crisis rather than tackle a worldwide case of the sniffles.  


Each player takes a pawn, places it in a room on the Rapid Response team’s dedicated support aircraft and flips the timer. In 2 minutes, players must roll 6 of their dice to jump between rooms, move closer to cities in need of aid, deliver aid to those cities or lock in their dice to create those supplies people are desperately crying out for. Help a city by delivering all its supplies and you earn another 2 minutes. Clear all the cities (the number of which is determined by difficulty level at the start of the game) and you win.  


It’s easy to think of yourself the hero, luck be damned and lock in dice to create supplies as swiftly as you possibly can for the good of humanity. But you’re no hero. You’re part of a team of humans, and those dice translate to your stamina. Locking them into supply slots are all well and good, but if you’re not at the right stage to activate a room and get those dice back, your future turns are completely useless when your pool of dice is edging closer to 0.  


You can’t do this alone. You need your teammates as much as they need you, and if you can’t communicate effectively with one another, you’ll end up wasting time. Time that the world does not have.

The mental gymnastics of tough choices and clear comms is to be expected from a great co-op game, but Rapid Response has to consider another element when it comes to how to handle panic: your physicality.

Playing RR with folks, newcomers especially, can occasionally end up with dice flailing, cubes launching, knuckles clashing and pawns rolling into storage rooms filled with syringes. Add this to the upkeep you have to do every time you successfully activate a room: adding supplies ready for distribution, rerolling the dice to see if waste - an unhelpful defeat mechanic - is generated, making sure everyone gets their dice back, discarding the saved city and adding a time token that grants you an extra round to the board. It’s a large amount of upkeep in high pressure circumstances that makes the area feel constrained.  


Co-op real time dice rollers aren’t anything new. Klenko’s premiere entry in the genre is Fuse, a game where you also dive in to grab dice whilst ignoring others and screwing yourself and your team over in the process. But it feels a lot smoother, all the while being just as tense as Rapid Response thanks to the real estate each player is given. Whilst each player in Fuse has to work with just 2 cards, Rapid Reponse players have to coordinate across a thin board, with multiple components that aren’t dice that can roll over in the heat of the moment.  


Yes, you could say the frenzy that occurs in Rapid Response that causes a team to upend components is all part of the frenetic nature of the game, but since when has cleaning up after others on a Ryanair flight been fun?  


These should be glaring flaws. And yet every time I’ve played this, with the experienced or newcomers, players have immediately wanted to play Rapid Response again, either to tackle it on a higher difficulty or because they’re beating themselves up because they could’ve been more coordinated, not in their planning, but in maneuvering around a messy board.  


It has played a trick on all of us. Its' flaws have become its strength. To those unaware, they get an enjoyable twenty minutes of tension. And for those who clock onto it, it’s still a joy that forces them to reconsider when an issue actually becomes fundamentally problematic.  


If Rapid Response is going for dice rolling dominance, it has failed. But I don’t think it was shooting for that. I think it was trying to get newcomers trying new things thanks to having the Pandemic brand emblazoned on the cover.

The series as become a beacon of dependable gaming for people coming into the hobby, erasing grainy memories of Monopoly infighting and scraps over Scrabble. Nowadays when I mention board games, instead of drearily moaning about remembering those ‘fun’ times, now recount trying out more recent games and finding them a joy. A frequent one of those is Pandemic.

Hi folks - bit of a lurker but first time poster... hope this link works...

**How long have you been in the hobby?**

I’ve only seriously started getting into board gaming in the past few months (when the majority of these games were bought). Like many people, for most of my life my knowledge of board games extended to Monopoly, Scrabble etc. The seeds for playing more engaging/interesting board games were planted a few years ago when I first played **A Game of Thrones**. A friend of mine introduced me, and I was hooked immediately (big fan of the books) - to the point where I bought the game almost straight away, and swatted up on the rulebook so that the next few times we played I was pointing out all the rules they’d been getting wrong. What a joy I must have been. Those friends moved away in the end (for what I can only assume were unrelated reasons) and over the next couple of years I would sporadically try to get different groups (mostly non-gamers) together to play the game, but it was always a challenge (game length, rules explanation, the backstabby elements etc.). In that time I’d also bought **Pandemic** and **Mysterium** and quite enjoyed those, but neither particularly grabbed me or made me want to delve much deeper into the hobby.

Somewhat out of the blue, my girlfriend bought me **Raptor** (lovely 2 player game) for Christmas last year. I really enjoyed it but she wasn’t too keen. Then a couple of friends who I'd started playing D&amp;D with casually mentioned this game called Evolution (and specifically **Evolution: Climate**). The concept was enough to pique my interest, and it wasn’t long after looking that game up that I came across BGG, SU&amp;SD, Watch It Played, and the plethora of games out there just waiting to be discovered… I went ahead and bought Evolution: Climate. Then **Evolution: Flight**. Then more and more games came onto my radar and eventually led to the collection I now have. I mostly play 2 players so a lot of these were bought with my partner in mind (so far she’s loved **7 Wonders Duel**, **Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective** and **Fog of Love**). It’s been trickier to get other people together for 3/4 player games, but I’m working on it.

What I have is still a pretty modest collection, but most of these were accumulated in a few months and I’ve promised myself (and my girlfriend) that I won’t be buying any more games this year – I really want to enjoy and make the most of what I have so far. (Although I already have my wishlist for next year in mind…)

**What would I change about my collection if I could?**

Early on I think I rushed with a couple of my purchases. **Ticket To Ride** and **Tiny Epic Galaxies** are not particularly interesting to me compared to the other games, so can’t see them getting to the table anytime soon. I’ve been more diligent with my research since, and I really enjoy the other games I have. I haven’t managed to get **Sons of Anarchy** to the table (I’ve heard it’s a great game but the theme is kinda niche).

Other than that I’d like to get my hands on some more co-op (and even solo) games next year. On my wishlist in particular is **Robinson Crusoe** and **This War Of Mine**. I’m also looking at expansions to what I already have – so perhaps **Pantheon** for 7WD, the Fog of Love or **Villainous** expansions, that kind of thing. I also watched a recent playthrough of **Jaws** and it looks right up my street.

**Favourite games**

My favourite games I own generally pull me in through some combination of engaging theme, interesting mechanics and attractive visuals. Evolution: Climate is at the top for those very reasons. Also high up on my list are - **Alien Legendary Encounters** (great theme, really fun to teach, this is a popular one with friends too), **Everdell** (looks gorgeous, love the card combos and the feeling of building your city) and **Legendary Creatures** (I don’t hear too much about this one – lots of interesting decisions about how to use your cards and, again, really visually appealing.)

**Newest games**

Everdell and **Duelosaur Island** are the last 2 I added. Haven’t gotten round to Duelosaur Island yet but I'm thoroughly enjoying Everdell. **Fox in the Forest** is also relatively new – and terrific.

Just a note to say what a great community this is – I’m also relatively new to Reddit but it’s been fun to see other people’s collections and hear views on so many different games. Keep being rad.",boardgames,t3_dj47hk

"The Board Game at the Heart of Viking Culture&gt;An ancient game known as “hnefatafl” held immense symbolic and religious significance.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Over the past 150 years, excavators have unearthed large quantities of gaming material from Viking boat burials. Dating from the 7th to the 11th centuries, most of it consists of checker-like pieces constructed from glass, whale bone, or amber. These pieces range from ordinary discs to ornate figurines and are usually uniform in shape and size, save for one prominent king piece, known as the hnefi. The archaeologist Mark Hall recently chronicled the contents of 36 burials containing such pieces in a 2016 article for *The European Journal of Archaeology*. This material, he says, indicates the game was much more than a frivolous way to kill time between raids. “Its presence in these burials suggests it was an aspect of everyday life that was desirable to see continued,” he says, as well as “a significant element that helped define the status of the deceased.”

Yeah, but what's its BGG rank? /s

"Thoughts on 'deluxe' as the new 'normal'To quote from the current Kickstarter for [Emperor's Choice](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/michaelmindes/emperors-choice-deluxified-edition?ref=BGGcontest):

&gt;You may have noticed that we do not have a Retail edition of Emperor’s  Choice as a pledge option. Tasty Minstrel Games started Deluxifying  their games with the release of Orleans in 2015. Since then, we  have  continued to give Kickstarter Backers the option to enjoy our games with  upgraded components, and this has worked very well for both us and our  customers.   
&gt;  
&gt;However, we have seen the Board Game industry change from  an era when satisfactory components and presentation were commonplace  into a time where Deluxe games are now becoming the new “normal”. We see  this and recognize it, and that is why for this release we offering  only a fantastically upgraded Deluxe version of Emperor’s Choice. **However,** **because of the higher cost of these games, we expect there to be far fewer copies than normal present in retail** **stores, and for any future printings to also require crowdfunding.** 

So, I acknowledge that when I say this bothers me a little, it's a classic old-man-yells-at-clouds moment. There's a lot of reasons why Tasty Minstrel would choose this approach, especially in regards to a Kickstarter project where aesthetics and component quality is a common way of trying to rise above the white noise of new projects. If I were more skeptical I'd wonder if the wording hints at creating an intentional sense of scarcity, but if the decision makes financial sense to them and backers aren't pissed off, I won't nag about it.

But as someone with a tight board game budget, the notion of 'deluxe' becoming the new 'normal' does bother me. I wonder whether people really do feel that way outside of regular Kickstarter backers. And I wonder whether companies deciding to adopt this mentality will artificially accelerate that trend, if it does exist outside of big-ticket 'crowdfunding'. It's a notion that could cut away options for people like me, who can't justify spending premium prices for a game that can and has been done at a fraction of the price.

Am I being paranoid or is this something worth discussing?",boardgames,t3_djjiij
"What's your go-to player colour, and why?Since my first TI4 game a year or so ago, I keep finding myself being drawn to *'Hacan'* **yellow** (if available).

"Pandemic: Rapid Response - A lesson in personal space for players and forgiving the flaws of tabletop games.When I nabbed Kane Klenko’s first entry into the Pandemic series, I expected panic induced gameplay, co-operative conundrums and another box to include in my ever growing Pandemic mosaic that’ll soon ingulf the wall. What I didn’t expect was for it to teach me just how important a player’s space is when it comes to real time dice rollers, something I had only really thought about in terms of dexterity games.  


Pandemic: Rapid Response is a real time dice roller that comes with the cities, the cubes and the unique roles of its series’ namesake, but plays over the course of several 2 minute rounds, with players rolling dice to generate resources needed to offset a humanitarian crisis rather than tackle a worldwide case of the sniffles.  


Each player takes a pawn, places it in a room on the Rapid Response team’s dedicated support aircraft and flips the timer. In 2 minutes, players must roll 6 of their dice to jump between rooms, move closer to cities in need of aid, deliver aid to those cities or lock in their dice to create those supplies people are desperately crying out for. Help a city by delivering all its supplies and you earn another 2 minutes. Clear all the cities (the number of which is determined by difficulty level at the start of the game) and you win.  


It’s easy to think of yourself the hero, luck be damned and lock in dice to create supplies as swiftly as you possibly can for the good of humanity. But you’re no hero. You’re part of a team of humans, and those dice translate to your stamina. Locking them into supply slots are all well and good, but if you’re not at the right stage to activate a room and get those dice back, your future turns are completely useless when your pool of dice is edging closer to 0.  


You can’t do this alone. You need your teammates as much as they need you, and if you can’t communicate effectively with one another, you’ll end up wasting time. Time that the world does not have.

The mental gymnastics of tough choices and clear comms is to be expected from a great co-op game, but Rapid Response has to consider another element when it comes to how to handle panic: your physicality.

Playing RR with folks, newcomers especially, can occasionally end up with dice flailing, cubes launching, knuckles clashing and pawns rolling into storage rooms filled with syringes. Add this to the upkeep you have to do every time you successfully activate a room: adding supplies ready for distribution, rerolling the dice to see if waste - an unhelpful defeat mechanic - is generated, making sure everyone gets their dice back, discarding the saved city and adding a time token that grants you an extra round to the board. It’s a large amount of upkeep in high pressure circumstances that makes the area feel constrained.  


Co-op real time dice rollers aren’t anything new. Klenko’s premiere entry in the genre is Fuse, a game where you also dive in to grab dice whilst ignoring others and screwing yourself and your team over in the process. But it feels a lot smoother, all the while being just as tense as Rapid Response thanks to the real estate each player is given. Whilst each player in Fuse has to work with just 2 cards, Rapid Reponse players have to coordinate across a thin board, with multiple components that aren’t dice that can roll over in the heat of the moment.  


Yes, you could say the frenzy that occurs in Rapid Response that causes a team to upend components is all part of the frenetic nature of the game, but since when has cleaning up after others on a Ryanair flight been fun?  


These should be glaring flaws. And yet every time I’ve played this, with the experienced or newcomers, players have immediately wanted to play Rapid Response again, either to tackle it on a higher difficulty or because they’re beating themselves up because they could’ve been more coordinated, not in their planning, but in maneuvering around a messy board.  


It has played a trick on all of us. Its' flaws have become its strength. To those unaware, they get an enjoyable twenty minutes of tension. And for those who clock onto it, it’s still a joy that forces them to reconsider when an issue actually becomes fundamentally problematic.  


If Rapid Response is going for dice rolling dominance, it has failed. But I don’t think it was shooting for that. I think it was trying to get newcomers trying new things thanks to having the Pandemic brand emblazoned on the cover.

The series as become a beacon of dependable gaming for people coming into the hobby, erasing grainy memories of Monopoly infighting and scraps over Scrabble. Nowadays when I mention board games, instead of drearily moaning about remembering those ‘fun’ times, now recount trying out more recent games and finding them a joy. A frequent one of those is Pandemic.  


The same people who may be deterred by hearing about high pressure games played in real time may be swayed into trying something that is part of a series that has become a mainstay that brings people together in order to attain victory, rather than turn against each other for a solitary win. The series that has reframed the hobby for some may now be ready to find new genres for those newly initiated to delve into and explore what tabletop games have to offer. Rapid Response feels like the first step in that process.

And that, no matter the ‘flaws’, might be its greatest success.This review is an excerpt from my [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WEeUrE8a98) originally posted on [Dicey Exploits](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx5bnIbrSmGsFFhJ9C6SeCg).",boardgames,t3_dj7t6c

"Question about Coup challenges.So I play Coup quite often at work and we had a situation come up that caused much disagreement between players.  
  
Here's the situation:  
Three players: A, B, &amp; C.

Player A ""assassinates"" Player B, but Player C is holding two Assassin cards, and one has been revealed already, so Player C knows for a fact that Player A is lying.  
  
Player C immediately challenges Player A's Assassin, and Player B has not said anything yet.  
  
My question:  
How does this situation get resolved?  
  
The problem is this:  
Normally Player B would have three options: Claim Contessa, Challenge Assassin, Take the hit. However, at this point Player C has challenged Player A already, and if we resolve that challenge before proceeding, that isn't really fair for Player A, because Player B would be able to make a decision about what to do based on information he otherwise would not have had.  
  
My solution was this:  
Player B must declare an action (Claim Contessa, Challenge Assassin, Take the hit) **before** Player C's challenge is resolved.  
  
Then, Player C's challenge is resolved, followed by whatever action that Player B decided to take.

"Where to get custom cards made?Hello Boardgamers and more specifically designers,

I have been trying to find a place to make low quantity (\~500 or 10 sets of 8 with some instructions) custom cards.

I have found a lot of places that do standard playing cards, however I was after a larger size. That's when my love of board games came to mind, they have all kinds of fancy cutomness about them.

So why am I asking here you say? Well, I am hoping someone has prototyped a game with cards. My requirements seemed to match that of a board game designer. Custom(but one of the many standard card sizes for board games), custom front, custom back, high quality and not a large amount of each. 

I am not confident in places I have found online, especially as I have no experience in them, therefore I am hoping to get some community recommendations.

"Someone asked for a cosmic sign to leave an a abusive relationship and got one. So they left. What the what?So. Just saw a post over at twoxchromosomes that was essentially titled “finally left an abusive relationship when I asked for a cosmic sign and got one” I’m paraphrasing here. But you get the idea.

And yes. I go to that subreddit because it’s a pretty good place sometimes. Just reading triumphant stories and people over coming hardships can make your day. And jumping into that positive feed back loop can work out for everyone sometimes. But this post left a sour taste in my mouth. And you can already guess why.

This person doesn’t seem to be religious. But it’s clear they rather think the universe is something more than it is. But what really bothered me was how few people pointed out (only saw one) that the entire chain of events defies logic. ( I also didn’t link the post because I’d rather not send anyone over there too easily but it’s easy enough to find. Over 8k pts)

You needed a sign from the universe to leave a relationship that was emotionally abusive?? And everyone is cool with that? This is a prime example of how spirituality and superstition hurts the believer. This is worse than a confused pokemon.

If a guy seems like an asshole. They’re probably an asshole. Don’t wait for the cosmic Rube Goldberg machine to butter your decision toast. Get the fuck out.(yes I’m aware there are situations that it isn’t that simple. But in this case. It was)

And don’t just blindly pat people on the back. Point out toxic decision making. That girl who touched your hand as you both reach for peanuts? Not a sign. Everyone gets hungry. Dropped your water the same time that sexy someone dropped their papers? Not a sign, you ruined their dissertation, run.

The worse is the only person I saw who pointed it out, the OP replied that: “If you want to make it boring, then sure. But I much prefer the projectile burning marshmallow phenomenon because it makes life more fun.”

I’m sorry. But if cosmic signs made life so fun. How did you end up in such a soul sucking situation? Why do people fail to make reasonable comparisons? Sure. It’s a lighthearted comment, but dismissing reality never ends lightheartedly.

"Christians don't acknowledge that Faith is Wish Thinking.I've got a rant here.Christians, I need you to define what you think faith is.  Because the Bible defines faith as ""Now Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen"" \[Heb 11:1\].  Without the flowery language, that means faith is feeling strongly about what you hope is true.  It's wish thinking.  So when Christians ask me why I don't have faith in \[x\], it's because I don't think that wishful thinking is a good way to live my life.

Now when I explain this to Christians, using their own book and terms, they think I'm being a smart ass.  I don't see how, I'm playing by their rules in the game they created.  Faith is wish-thinking.

Inevitably, I'll then hear some version of the following argument and it becomes painfully obvious that they don't understand that the word 'faith' has several meanings, and they are using it wrong when they talk about their beliefs.

Christian: ""Well you have faith that your airplane will arrive at an airport!""

I tell them that they are equivocating.  I tell them that the word faith has several meanings and that airlines aren't founded upon an assurance of hope that their planes will not crash.  And they call me a smart ass.

So I put it to you, Reddit.

"Bashing Conservapedia!https://www.conservapedia.com/Gender_confusion

&gt;Gender confusion or gender dysphoria is the problematic state of not realizing or finding it difficult to accept what gender a person is. It is common among people who choose to not adhere to traditional gender roles, such as homosexuals, transsexuals, transvestites and cross-dressers. Parents must make the roles of mother (=females) and father (=males) very clear, so that children can learn and affirm that there are differences between boys and girls. Under good parenting, the children will not become confused about gender.

"Muslim women don't have a choiceToday at work we were talking about culture and clothing and the hijab topic got brought up, and my coworkers started talking about how they were told that girls have a choice when they're old enough to put on the hijab, that it's a choice, this being a professional setting all I said was no they don't have a choice it's a part of the religion that some people choose not to obey, like Christians choose to drink alcohol,I didnt want to get into how parents force their 9 year old girl to wear the hijab regardless of what she wants and how most of the time a girl is shamed in dressing conservatively and forced to conform to the culture. It's really sad that there are people peddling bs to people who don't know the culture and try to spin the hijab as a good thing




Edit: apparently we have alot of pro islam beliefs in here who don't believe the quran says anything about hijab 

In Chapter 33 known as al-Ahzab, verse 59, Allah gives the following command to Prophet Muhammad:

يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ, قُلْ لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَ بَنَاتِكَ وَ نِسآءِ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ: يُدْنِيْنَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلاَبِيْبِهِنَّ...

“O Prophet! Say to your wives, your daughters, and the women of the believers that: they should let down upon themselves their jalabib.”

What is the meaning of “jalabib”?

Jalabib جَلاَبِيْبٌ is the plural of jilbabجِلْبَابٌ , which means a loose outer garment. See any Arabic dictionary like Lisanu ’l-‘Arab, Majma‘u ’l-Bahrayn or al-Munjid.
Al-Munjid, for instance, defines jilbab as “the shirt or a wide dress—القميص أو الثوب الواسع.” While al-Turayhi, in Majma‘u ’l-Bahrayn, defines it as “a wide dress, wider than the scarf and shorter than a robe, that a woman puts upon her head and lets it down on her bosom...”5",atheism,t3_djeyad

"Voluntarily homeless ""missionary"" takes advantage of poor co-worker barely scraping byI work with the nicest elderly woman in the world. She's in her mid-70's, is disabled and we work in a warehouse environment. For story purposes, let's call her Jen. Jen lives in a rent-controlled senior apartment complex, and we get paid terribly for the hard work and long hours we put in. Jen is one of the hardest workers on the team, and despite being disabled, she goes above and beyond the physical duties the job requires (even though I have to intervene sometimes!). We're actually good friends despite the 50+ year age gap because we're so similar personality-wise and have a ton of common interests.

The main difference is I'm an agnostic atheist, and she's a gnostic theist. I've never told her as to avoid the inevitable conversion conversations that would follow, but I politely listen to her stories about how god talks to her. (god told me to do x, god told me to do y, etc... Just thoughts she has but thinks they're god telling her.) She's a hardcore believer despite never really read the bible, so most of her knowledge comes from Facebook articles (she told me they found Noah's Ark and some of Jesus' blood??) and projecting loving qualities onto an imaginary friend. She's so kind and has had an extremely rough life so I hate saying these things but this is necessary for the rant I'm about to get into.

A few weeks ago she tells me her daughter befriended a homeless lady (???) wanted the homeless lady to stay with her (???) and her husband wouldn't let her so she asked her elderly mother who's living paycheck to paycheck to have her stay with her (?!?!?!??!)

I asked her why the woman was homeless and guess what? She's \*voluntarily\* homeless to be a missionary! Apparently she's god's chosen child, and never has to work again a day in her life because god will provide strangers to give her a place to stay, food to eat, water to drink and clothes to wear. I got such a sick feeling and told her that isn't safe, and she deserves to be taken care of in her golden years, not to have to take care of someone who can obviously care for themselves but chooses not to. She said she's lived a great life and god told her to spread the love so she took this woman in.

So now my extremely naive friend, who is only able to make ends meet due to social security checks and exclusively eats food from the $0.99 store, is taking care of a grown ass woman who's delusional enough to think god says she's a chosen missionary, therefore can burden others. I asked her what she did for lunch last time we worked together, and it turns out instead of eating she went and bought nice toiletries for this woman. She knows I hate this arrangement and it's extremely unsafe because she has no idea who this lady actually is, and she told me, ""She's nice, like you! I can tell because you're both so kind."" She's known me for 5+ years, and this woman for maybe two weeks.

Religion is a cancer to all of society, but it can effect the kindest people in the worst ways. It can turn people who are otherwise rational and confident into ignorant fools. I just hope nothing happens to her, and this ""homeless"" woman moves the fuck on to her next sucker as soon as possible.

"Not being allowed to talk to my GFSo I don't know where else to go for this but, just recently my kind of girlfriend's(she isn't allowed to date but we've agreed we like eachother)  parents found out about my atheism how I'm not sure. They confronted my parents with this and I was essentially told that if I didnt believe in God I wouldnt be aloud to talk to her until we were 18(16 currently)
This of course crushed me and I was able to convince my parent that I was more agnostic then atheist and that I was only questioning it.
At the moment all is well but its killing me just lying to them like that. 
Any advice? Cause I could really use some. Posting this was mildly risky but I need outside opinions.
