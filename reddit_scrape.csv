"When practicing outside your scope harms your patients.I’m a pharmacist in a place used to access the mountains. I see so much inappropriate prescribing of acetazolamide to treat “mountain sickness” when we aren’t anywhere near high enough to actually get mountain sickness. Generally these tourists are suffering dehydration as it is much dryer here than where these people are from, a diuretic isn’t great medicine in someone suffering dehydration. I’m sure these doctors in Dallas, New York, and the middle of nowhere Mississippi have the best intentions but come on if it is outside your area of practice tell them to go to the urgent care. When I was younger and working in the mountains it was even worse. So many zpaks to treat the normal acclimation of the body to a higher and dryer place. I know telling a patient “I don’t know” is hard but please doctors if your patient is on vacation please tell them to go to the urgent care.

I guess what my point here is that I think more frequently prescribers need to build into their thought process am I the right person to treat this when faced with something that you don’t see every day. Most primary care doctors won’t hesitate to send someone to the cardiologist but for some reason will try to treat many other conditions they are much less familiar with than cardiology.",medicine,t3_dkzyax

"Why does the presence of glucose in the proximal tubule in the nephrons result in a lesser reabsorption of sodium ions?I thought that the when glucose in the filtrate reached over the threshold for reabsorption, the reason that we get increased diuresis was because glucose is an osmolyte and thus increased glucose would cause water retention in the proximal tubule since the glucose holds on to the water.   
However my professor said that this is incorrect, and the correct answer is that the presence of glucose in the tubule inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and this is what causes the retention of water. I could not really understand his explanation on this subject and when i search on google it just says that the water retention is caused because glucose is an osmolyte and therefore causes retention (the same understandig that i first had). Could anyone maybe elaborate on what my professor said or explain it differently? I'm pretty confused about this. Hope my question makes sense, thank you in advance",medicine,t3_djr8kr

"""I'm healthy, haven't seen a doctor in 10 years""I'm only in my third year of practice, but already have been humbled several times by middle aged men with a version of the above statement.  Often, they only come to see you at the behest of their wife.  The ones that concern me are those with seemingly minor complaints, or that brush off symptoms most other people wouldn't.

I recently saw a 60 yo gentleman coming in with a few days of lower abdominal pain.  He told me he was otherwise healthy and hadn't been to the doctor in almost 10 years.  He had some mild diarrhea but no vomiting, no fevers, no other concerning complaints.  He was mildly tender on exam in the LLQ but otherwise stable.  I thought he likely had a gastro or mild diverticulitis, and recommended he go to the ER since it was late Friday afternoon and any workup we did from clinic wouldn't return until after the weekend.

He ended up going to the ER the next day, and had some labs that showed a WBC of 13 but otherwise normal.  He had an abdo xray that was normal, and was discharged, presumably with the same diagnosis. 

Today, he came back to clinic, mostly frustrated that they made him wait and ""didn't do anything"" at the ER.  I reassessed him and was concerned enough to do a more urgent workup.  I even phoned the radiologist at the nearest hospital, and she was able to get him in for a CT later this afternoon.  

The findings caught me off guard.  He has peritoneal carcinomatosis, multiple enlarged intraabdominal lymph nodes, several irregular liver masses, and ascites.  Possible cholangiocarcinoma primary.  

I was very much surprised by this, and unfortunately I think this came off in my delivery of the bad news to the patient. 

I recognize that this is probably going to cloud my judgement and cause me to over order tests for the next while.  But I can't help thinking, what if this was my father, who is roughly the same age as the patient I saw today (and hasn't seen a doctor in probably 20 years).

TLDR: 60 yo M that I thought had gastro, actually had advanced malignancy with peritoneal carcinomatosis.",medicine,t3_dij2t4

"ER Docs, what would you like your psych colleagues to know?Just finished a CPEP (psych ER) shift. How it works at my hospital is that patients brought in to the CPEP are evaluated by a psychiatrist. If we feel there's a medical concern that can't be treated by us, we transfer to the main ER for medical treatment prior to admission or transfer back after stabilized.

We tend to have a good relationship with the ER doctors (mostly because they're overjoyed that they don't have to deal with any psych patients who present to them lol) but yesterday was a bit of an issue.  

When I came on to shift, the psychiatrist coming off told me incredulously how much push-back he got for transferring a patient with 200/120 BP to the main ER. He was convinced that this required workup to rule out stroke or other major issue. I didn't argue with him (he's an attending, I'm a resident) but my understanding of the literature is that asymptomatic hypertension wouldn't be treated in an ED anyway and so it was actually a completely pointless transfer. Long story short, I quickly accepted the patient back after he left (they did no workup in the ED other than restarting home meds which is completely reasonable imo) and things are fine.

My question to you guys, however, is what things like this would you like your psych colleagues in CPEPs/PES/PEC's to know? This is the first time I've run into this but I'm sure that attending has transferred many patients to the ED with asymptomatic hypertension. What other common things do you guys see from the psych side that you wish we would know how to handle better?",medicine,t3_dhs595

"New report reveals shortage of hospital doctors in rural areasNew report reveals alarming shortage of country doctors

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/oct/13/nhs-consultant-shortage-rural-coastal-areas?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Copy_to_clipboard

This is from the UK, and says that hospitals are not able to recruit attendings in rural areas, coastal areas (unlike the US the coasts are the deprived neglected areas) and post industrial towns and cities.

Although I don't want to go into any 'middle grade' discussion it was interesting that the US seems to have similar issues.

In the UK in a rural area you would usually have a GP in a village, so maybe half an hours drive, and a hospital in the town which won't have all the specialities but do the basic medical and surgical stuff, with an ED. The hospital might be up to an hour away, typically. But people want to work in larger cities.

In the US or Oz, much bigger countries, I guess a shortage of rural docs has more impact.

How many hours drive to see a doctor elsewhere? Is it like 3 hours in rural US? (Based on my watching of Fargo...)

I understand the US and Oz has extra money for rural docs, maybe we need that.",medicine,t3_dh89c2

"AKA and stroke?This may be an embarrassingly stupid question - if it is, I apologise. It won’t be my first or my last. 

I’m a rural hospitalist. I’ve just picked up a patient with (resolving) alcoholic ketoacidosis - when he came in he had pH 7.18, base excess-16,  lactate 3.7, 4+ ketones in urine. He was also in AKI - creatinine 707, normal six months ago, urea 18.2. He was in our HDU and a day (!) later is markedly improved- both from an AKA and an AKI point of view - and is now mine.  Ongoing alcohol withdrawal management including IV thiamine, etc.  He looks and feels a great deal better - 

- except he has had new onset intractable hiccups and new onset difficulty swallowing with some odynophagia, both for about the last 24h. 

I am working the hiccups and the swallowing difficulties up as per normal but I am wondering if a brainstem infarct - maybe from an episode of AF, or a hypercoagulable state or whatever - could cause both of these?

"PCP Clinics, how does yours operate?Just curious on how other PCP clinics are ran, the one I'm currently scribing at isn't operating that great due to the following things:

- Throwing walk-ins on the schedule without telling the PCP + double booking.

- Allowing patients that are significantly late (&gt;30 minutes) to be still seen.

- There is no charge for paperwork (FMLA, disability), they do it during their regular visit on top of discussing their chronic and/or acute issues, but I know some clinics charge patients $20-30 out of their pocket.

- No text-based communication system for scheduling, refills, etc. Even if 25% of patients preferred using it, that would cut down significantly on the amount of phone calls the front desk receive.

- Staff is very inefficient, I try to teach them ways to be quicker using Epic, but they go back to their old habits.

- There's supposed to be a limit of no-shows before they get discharged, but this isn't strictly enforced at all.

After scribing for a year now at an IM clinic, I would be content in that field if I owned my own clinic and hired competent employees; the above problems I've listed seem to be mostly due to the staff and physicians not really enforcing their own rules.

"Inpatient PrisonersDoes anyone routinely take care of prisoners, either inpatient or in the ED?

As a resident (NJ)we had a not insignificant number of prisoners come to our hospital though mostly for our primary care and specialty clinics.  They'd be bused in under supervision but then once in the room the guards would wait outside until we were finished with history/examination.

I am now in an attending in a neighboring state (PA) and here the prison guards refuse to leave the room when I come to see the patient.  Even give attitude and a hard time about removing the patient's metal hand cuffs so that I can examine them for the rectal bleeding they present for.  Patient's are obviously less forthcoming about their history and do not want to be exposed in such a way to multiple people and it restricts my/our team's ability to provide the care the patient needs.

He tells me this is his second episode of unilateral epistaxis and has a history of rinitis and adenoid removal five years ago.

His physical is unremarkable. His BP is at 130x90.

When he had the first episode he came to the ED and a doctor here did what he had to do, screened for coagulation defects and referred to the otolaryngology as an outpatient. He did tell him about the borderline BP.

This patient then proceeds to scheduling a cardiologist because he thought his BP was high. 

And he went to the worst cardiologist I can think of.

As to why I'm mad:

This kid comes today with a briefcase of exams. This cardiologist made him do:

Ergometric Stress Test.

Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 24h

Holter test 24h

Echocardiogram

Full blood tests, including ambulatory troponin (I'm like whaaaaat?)

"What's your ""this could go either way"" emergent intubation chat?I'm looking for some advice for those cases where  you've got some time (&lt;30 minutes), but not much. They are needing tubed for worsening whatever (clinical details not relevant aside from the fact they are able to struggle but converse).   
  
You hope everything will be alright but you have a sinking feeling it probably won't, and it will be the last time the patient is awake and able to speak to their family.  
  
Do you tell them this might be a last goodbye and scare them? 
  
What do you say that conveys the gravity of the situation but also affirm that it is not an end of life situation... but it may well develop into one and there is an uncertainty in critical illness.  I don't usually see my colleagues offering a moment with the patient and the family when if you are organised you could give them like 5 mins max when you get ready. 
  
Personally, if it were me I would know obviously because of our work so I would tell my loved ones I loved them but patients often lack that insigh into the severity of their disease or their prognosis is uncertain due to other factors. A lot of the times it's all just reassurance: ""everything's  going to be fine, see you in a couple days when your lungs are better etc etc"".

   I've tubed a lot of people in these semi emergent situations and i often regret not allowing them this opportunity. I find the reassurance method works fine but when you know yourself that it might be fatal, i feel like ive stolen a moment from the family they could have had. Obviously these are dynamic time critical situations so having the time to do this is a luxury and sometime you just need to get on with it. I am talking about the situations where it is possible and you do have a very small amount of time.
  
I don't want to terrify them or their families  anymore than they already are, but those last moments (if they are the last ones) are precious and I think having a prepared chat to highlight this without coming across as an end of life discussion would be good.

"People are adamant about how inconsiderate it is to expect free services from friends in creative jobs (like designers, architects), business owners, etc. How about medicine?Hello, reddit. English is not my native language, so excuse any typos or innacuracies regarding medical terms. 

The title expresses a thought I had a while ago, when I joked with a friend of mine who's an architect that she'd help me design my room someday. She answered something about her prices, which I found completely reasonable. But this got me thinking afterwards.

I have treated her many times. Just last week she called me with strong abdominal pain and nausea and I explained the possible diagnosis, recommended some medications for her and asked her to keep in contact along the day to keep me informed.

I treated her family members a handful of times, too. She even created a group in Whatsapp with other two friends who are also physicians because her father was ill about a year ago (I don't remember specifics, but it lasted a few days) and she used it many times since then when her at least 3 family members got sick (that I can think of now).

None of us ever charged her a penny for this. A couple of days ago, another friend commented how she was feeling kind of anxious. I offered her to come to my house so that we could talk and see if the had some anxiety disorder and possibly prescribe something. I didn't charge her. These are the most recent situations, but there are many other examples just like them in my still very short career as a physician.

I see a lot of posts on social media going on about how you should value the work of your friends, normally those in creative industries, and how offensive it is when you expect them to work for free just because you're a friend. I see it especially often with graphic designers (oh yeah, I've seen one of those for free, too). I understand the sentiment, but I honestly never thought about charging a friend for anything, and they have never, ever offered to pay or given me some sort of thank you gifts, either. Considering how the consultation is often time-consuming, the actual responsibility that comes with every word and prescription from a physician and how demanding the investment to become a doctor is, I really can't see why someone who thinks that designers should not work for free wouldn't apply the same rule for doctors.

"Tobramycin in bacterial conjunctivitisHello Doctors of Reddit. I'm a young doctor who has just started practicing. Seems like all the family physicians around me and even the ophthalmologist think that Tobramycin is a good first line antibiotic for bacterial conjunctivitis. However neither on BMJ Best Practice nor on UpToDate Tobramycin is indicated as a first line antibiotic. UpToDate even says that ""Aminoglycoside drops and ointments are poor choices since they are toxic to the corneal epithelium and can cause a reactive keratoconjunctivitis after several days of use"".

So what's the right answer? Am I sticking to these clinical decision services too much and I'm loosing my critical thinking or all the other doctors around me are unqualified?",medicine,t3_ddjw35

"Has anyone else noticed an increase in young patients aggressively trying to get diagnosed with depression/anxiety?I've noticed a new and growing phenomenon in my clinic. I'm not a pediatrician but I do work primarily with a younger patient base aged 18-24 (because of my area demographics and specialization). And recently there has been an increase in younger patients, usually Generation Z, who come in for an appointment confident that they absolutely have either depression and/or anxiety. They'll bring a laundry list of symptoms and most of the time it doesn't pass the SIGECAPS muster or the criteria for any other diagnosable disease. Most of the time it can be explained by environmental stresses and relationship issues instead of a bona fide mood disorder. Yet they are *sure* they have it. Absolutely sure. And when I gently try to push back and suggest maybe it's more of a subacute behavioral problem - they get upset.

I've had kids bring me printouts of random blogs with questionable studies, or stories of Youtubers who self-diagnosed, etc. And they argue for 20 minutes with me about this. I've had one young woman get extremely distraught when I said I wasn't going to make a diagnosis of depression, and she yelled at me saying ""*You're trying to deny my lived experience!*"" Fortunately that one was an outlier.

I have no problem referring people to therapy, or prescribing appropriate medication when it is needed. But I will not be bullied into making a diagnosis that simply is not present. Yet in recent years, especially in younger people, there seems to be more pressure to formally label them as depressed. I don't get it.

Furthermore I do not understand why someone would want to be diagnosed with this disease in particular. I've never had to argue someone out of thinking they have bipolar or schizophrenia or anything like that. It's always depression or anxiety. Why would you want this? There are no societal benefits to it. SSRI's aren't addictive and don't sell on the black market. Why?

Do any other PCPs have a similar issue? Has there been any research or commentary done on why this is happening?",medicine,t3_dcxo28
"What else can i ask for instead of a raise ?TLDR at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to change jobs. In my old job, I am working 13 days a month, for 12 hours, all clinical duties and getting paid $200k annually for that. 

The new job that I am getting, is making me work 14 days a month, other details same, but paying me $190k for that. I am also getting an IT position that has 'undefined' role and hours, because its newly created for me and is getting me extra $10k. I am also getting 3K more than my previous job for CME education and licensing needs. 

Now, if the maths was right and numbers comparable, I should be getting $220k + 10k in my new job. But I am not, so overall **20k less**. I tried to negotiate over the phone, that although I didnt expect a raise, I didnt expect to go down either. My future boss made a BS story about how immigration costs are almost 40k and what we are offering you is far more valuable than money. 

And, I understand, not everything is about money and career growth opportunities come rarely. And the offer of green card is enticing as well. Basically, a lot of reasons to join the new job. 

But somewhere deep down, I cant help but feel that I am getting screwed. I know that immigration doesnt cost 40k and boss is making BS excuses. The contract is for 2 years, and despite the fact that immigration cost is only for the first year, I dont see a raise happening in the middle of a 2 year contract. 

So , I guess my questions are 

1. apart from asking for a raise or less amount of work, what else can i ask to sweeten the deal ? 
2. is there a better way to ask for a raise ? 
3. Can i ask for protected administrative time ? How ? 

edit - no sign on bonus, no relocation bonus, no retention bonus, the kind of job that i do, i dont really get or need an office with a secretary. i can ask for extra money for further education.

"Why Is A Refugee Camp ""Butcher-Surgeon"" Wrapping a Wound in a Raw Chicken Skin?I tried posting this video a month ago but an unknown viewer didn't like the graphic medical footage and reported it so youtube removed it.  I'm reposting it for this subreddit only because I really want to figure out why the butcher-surgeon used a raw chicken skin.   There is a small amount of blood but I don't think it will be an issue for any of you guys.

Most people assume that “butcher-surgeons” disappeared around 200 years ago. They are in fact quite common in rural Africa, Asia, and South America. Meet ([VIDEO LINK!](https://youtu.be/2OUgMPZe56I)) [Gamar](https://youtu.be/2OUgMPZe56I), a Sudanese camp refugee. By day he slaughters goats and cows. By night he fixes compound fractures and other serious injuries. His secret weapon? He wraps the wound in a raw chicken skin. (3:55, for those of you who don't have time to watch the entire 4.5 minute video)

So here's my question: I've seen fresh chicken skins used on three different continents. I can think of no earthly reason why it would help (and several reasons why it would hurt). Am I missing something?

"The state of anti-aging science, supplements (NMR) and clinical practiceI have recently read David Sinclair's book *Lifespan: Why We Age—and Why We Don't Have To*. David is a Harvard scientist researching ageing, with particular focus on sirtuins. Most of this book is a summary of the state of research of ageing, and the push towards rebranding it as a disease. From a medical perspective, Sinclair says that he makes no recommendations to the public, but he incorporates the following drugs and supplements into his routine (and so do, apparently, a significant amount of his scientific colleagues and family):

&gt;I take 1 gram (1,000 mg) of NMN every morning along with 1 gram of resveratrol (shaken into my homemade yogurt) and 1 gram of metformin. I take a daily dose of vitamin D, vitamin K2, and 83 mg of aspirin.

Most of the research so far on NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) is in mice models, showing an increase in NAD+ and longevity/increased lifespan.

As medical practitioners, what are your thoughts on this supplement (NMN, or resveratrol), the research behind it, whether you'd recommend it to patients (or yourself!) without further trails, and the state of aging as a research topic in general?

"Recommendations for mental health care for physiciansI thought we could share any organizations that are tailored to getting physicians assistance with mental health treatment.   With the persistent negative stigma and issues with many licensing boards it makes it difficult for medical professionals to get the care they need.

Metropolitan Medical Foundation of Oregon. 

https://www.msmp.org/Physician-Wellness

They have free visits so insurance is not involved. These are supported by donations.  There is no documentation in an EMR and no diagnosis is given so there is little to hold against a physician who is seeking care.  

You dont need to be a member to get the care.

"How do you deal with rude/unprofessional managerial staff?Having an issue with a nurse manager who is now getting other staff members upset and I am unsure what to do.

A nurse brought a concern to me about a patient being severely fatigued during the day on an ongoing basis and was concerned it was their medications. After looking at their history and finding this was unlikely the issue, I observed the patient having a 10 second apnea episode while napping and decided to order a sleep study to rule out sleep apnea as the issue making him fatigued during the day.

The nurse manager questioned the respiratory therapist about why this was ordered, who would be paying for it and made a comment to the effect of me not knowing anything and we have the same degree and clearly I did not learn anything during my degree program (nurse manager has an MSN....in administration, so not clinical). 

The sleep study ended up getting done which showed severe sleep apnea and their fatigue was greatly improved on the CPAP. Nurse manager wanted the RT to not show me the results of the test and instead show someone else instead because again, I don't know anything. The RT told her even if she showed the pulmonologist, the results would be the same. The nurse manager said all of this stuff at the nursing station in front of a whole bunch of staff.

Last week as I was getting on the elevator, she went up one side of me and down another for changing someone's diabetes meds ""when the patient has been stable for so long."" I am a certified diabetes educator and board certified in advanced diabetes management, so I definitely know more than a little about diabetes management and wanted to get the patient down on insulin as much as possible (patient was only on insulin and nothing else with great renal function which made no sense where they have T2DM). She accused me in front of other staff in the elevator and at the nursing station of not knowing what I am doing and not knowing how to manage diabetes and I had to painstakingly explain the labs I checked to show they're still making endogenous insulin and we should try sensitizing them to insulin to lower their weight and insulin requirements and the patient was fully on board with this and wanted it.

I am unsure what to do at this point. Other staff have reported her to the Director of Nursing, I told my practice medical director today and he was very supportive and said the manager has had lots of personal conflicts in the past and doesn't get along with anyone really. I've never run into this problem and every other manager and DON I work with I have a great relationship with. She is constantly second-guessing my clinical decision making and if those sleep study results had been hidden from me and tucked away, it would have affected the patient's care. She also doesn't want us ordering vaccines for patients who need them ""because they're all going to die soon anyway.""

"Acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema secondary to AF with RVR in the context of severe sepsisPreamble. I am a physician in acute internal medicine based in London, UK. Recently I managed a case that brought up a clinical scenario I face time and time again and am unsure regarding the correct approach.

On the shop floor on our level 1 acute medical unit was an 84 year old female previously independent in ADL and IADLS with a past medical history significant for osteoporosis, renovascular CKD stage 1, treated arterial hypertension, degenerative lumbar spondylosis with spinal stenosis. She was admitted 24 hours prior with a short history of new generalized abdominal discomfort, vomiting, subjective fevers and altered mental status. Examination was significant for SIRS (tachycardia 150, T 38.8, RR 24, other parameters within normal limits) a positive Murphy's sign without focal peritonism and  hypoactive delirium. The patient was in hypoxaemic respiratory failure with RR 24, FiO2 0.40 with bilateral basilar rales. Laboratory studies revealed lactate 2.2 (without acidemia) CRP 200, WCC 18,000 (neutrophil predominant with left shift and toxic granulation), moderete cholestatic hepatitis with normal bilirubin. ECG was AF with RVR and erect  chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral perihilar haze with interstitial opacities. USS of hepatobiliary tree revealed features consistent with cholecystitis. POC echocardiogram was not performed.

Prior to my attendance the patient was managed with empiric antibiotics for intra-abdominal sepsis and commenced on furosemide 40mg IV BID while awaiting surgical consult. When I evaluated BP was 120 systolic and rate 130-150/min with expected lability characteristic of AF. UO per urometer was 40ml/hr. FiO2 was 0.40 with SpO2 93% and RR 28. ABG revealed hypoxaemia without hypercapnia. Serial hsTnT were 35 and 33ng/L respectively. I instituted two treatments and the patient's clinical status and parameters improved significantly.

My question relates to how to best manage acute cardiogenic pulmonary oedema in the context of the sepsis syndrome. I am particularly interested in the approach of any intensivists/cardiologists amongst us. The rationale for posting this question is that my treatment regimen in this case was contested by a colleague and I realised I don't have a significant evidence base for most of my acute interventions aside from personal experience.

"Stupid question regarding perforated ulcerWe're struggling quite a bit in our Med-Surg 1 class with incorrect information given in lecture. So I'm double-checking everything.

Our instructor has stated that tachypnea occurs as a sign of peptic ulcer perforation due to pressure from contents leaking out of GI. 

This doesn't feel right to me - it seems like it would take a lot of leakage, and it seems like the leakage would put pressure on, and start eating away at, organs below the diaphragm before it could get to the point of putting pressure upwards on the diaphragm to the point of compressing the lungs.

"What is the point of standalone EDs?I've been noticing lots of standalone EDs in my community and I was wondering if this is a good thing or not. These EDs are 30 min away from the nearest hospital so they can't admit someone who is too sick to be DC'd home, they need EMS to transport them to another facility. They can't possibly keep enough physician staff on site to consult for many problems, they're definitely not stroke/MI centers, and they can't be trauma centers. I don't know how they could have imaging more advanced than a CT scanner or 2 on site. Are these just glorified urgent cares?

As someone who is interested in EM, I'm wondering if this trend is national (in US), if it will continue, and what it might mean for practicing EM physicians. Do these really improve access in certain communities or are they primarily a for-profit endeavor?

"Radiology question; Contrast CT/MRI vs non-contrast studiesSo, really stupid question incoming, please forgive me;  Throughout residency, when I was working with (or rotating on) radiology, I was given conflicting information on when to do contrast studies vs when they're unnecessary. Now, I can't help but want clarification on the differences between the studies and was curious if anyone wanted to chime in to help a simple family practitioner out. I've been told by different radiologists all of these things;   

• ""Contrast CT studies don't give me any more information than I need, so there's no point in ordering it unless you're asking me to look for something in specific""   

• ""You should get contrast CT studies whenever the patient is capable of tolerating it (with a few exceptions) because it's helpful to me as the reader.""    

• ""MRI with contrast is only indicated if the patient has a history of trauma/surgery in the area you're looking at""

"Signs of awareness in unconscious patientsI wondered if anyone could help me understand my title. I’m a junior doctor, not yet completed a speciality (but interested in ITU maybe). 

I was involved in a cardiac arrest secondary to a patient who self-tied ligature around the neck as a suicide attempt. It is unknown exactly when they tied the ligature but they had not been seen for about 30 minutes. It could be 20 minutes before they were found or even 20 seconds. 

When they were discovered, they were in cardiac arrest and their face and lips were discoloured with a blue tint. We regained ROSC after 20 minutes, 1mg adrenaline and 1 shock. They made no respiratory effort. 

The paramedics intubated them on the scene and transferred them to a medical hospital. 

The paramedics have now said that while in the ambulance they:
1) started breathing at 8 breaths per minute
2) moved her head and hand ‘occasionally’
3) started tearing (i.e tears were seen coming from her eyes)
4) blood pressure increasing

They said the latter three were signs of “awareness” so they sedated her with morphine and midaz. 

I’ve tried to do some research but I’m not really getting anywhere. Is it possible that in the ambulance they regained consciousness then? Is it possible to for this to happen immediately after a hypoxic brain injury? Would it be meaningful consciousness i.e would they feel pain, fear, confusion?

"Mental burden of residencyHoly cow. Just now reading an email from a couple of months ago (combination of being behind in email and avoidance coping).

For background, I tried to start 2 research protocols in residency. I spent about a month right before residency started writing up the first one. We lost the therapeutic capability needed for it as I was finishing it up and it went down the toilet. The 2nd one was a study to validate a screening questionnaire. I was going to recruit several hundred volunteers over the course of 3ish years to see if this screening tool worked. I was supported in both of these by an incredibly kind and patient mentoring doc who works for the hospital's research department. He held my hand every step of the way and never pressured me unduly.

This protocol went to the IRB multiple times. They shot it back at every step with a bunch of concerns, some of which were valid and some of which felt \*very\* much like contrived roadblocks to prevent anything but an absolutely \*perfect\* protocol from making it through. This protocol has been sitting on the back burner for the past year since graduating. I added a resident 2 years behind me and he has done just about nothing for the project. I haven't put in much more work because a) still \*really\* busy since graduating b) avoidance bias (see above).

I got an email from the nice mentor doc a couple of months back. I've tried to read it a couple of times but haven't been able to bring myself to do it. I knew it was going to say, essentially, that the protocol is dead. I feel like I let him down. I feel like I let the other attending whose idea this whole screener was down. I feel like I didn't adequately prioritize this work during residency (even though I \*know\* that I, like my classmates, was dying under the crushing load of residency and didn't have anything left to give).

So now I just opened up this email and started reading. It says pretty much what I thought it would in the same kind, supporting, non-judgmental tone I anticipated.

\*\*And I am freaking the fuck out\*\*

This feels like a low-grade panic attack. My hands are shaking. My heart is racing. My thoughts keep running to suicide, an oldie-but-goldie coping strategy; yes, I know it's bad and counterproductive and yes, I've been trying to work my way out of it over the past year, but holy cow did it ever come rushing back like a freight train. I am \*\*amazed\*\* at how strongly these feelings came out of nowhere. I don't really know what to do with it (other than the obvious answer of ""go seek the mental healthcare that you fear will jeopardize your future"").

Anyone else have any sudden flashbacks like this? Anyone else out of residency but still struggling with the weight of it? Anyone else wondering if they'll ever be able to have a ""normal"" career in medicine?

For those who read this far, thanks for listening. I'm honestly just typing this out because I feel like I need to put words down somewhere and it helps to feel like somebody's listening.

"Do you ever check in on your grandparents or parents records? I decided to check on mine after a long demiseMy grandfather passed away approximately a year ago.

Today I decided to go through some of his items. I decided to thumb through some of his previous medical records in a file I found.  

He is always been pretty private about his medical conditions. Didn't ask for much in terms of advise and....well I didn't want to ask too much since he didn't want to talk about it. He would always want to drink a Lone Star when I would come visit him and bullshit with me. So, we drank beer, ate some cheese, and talked about life / women / guns / cattle / religion (The Texas pentad as we can call it) .  He was 87 when he passed away, had COPD on 4 L of home O2, A. fib, CAD with previous stents.


When I entered medical school and throughout my training his COPD really started advancing.  He spent the last 3 to 4 years of his life more or less bedbound and could only walk between the couch and the bed without significant shortness of breath.


Thumbing through the records were a bit eye-opening.  It looks like his primary care doctor was more or less giving him monthly to semi-monthly methylprednisolone injections, he had a sleep study done, he had 5 echoes outpatient, an MRI brain for tremors in his last year, he had for stress test EVERY YEAR in the last 4 years of his life, and had a few CT scans of the chest when he had bronchitis.  Keep in mind, he could not walk more than 50 yards.

So with this I couldn't help but think of how everything could have went so wrong.

I remember having end of life discussions briefly while talking about religion with him and he would always tell me, he is ready when it is his time to go. But looking at the advanced directives portion of the primary cares note.....this part is left blank. 

Even at the end of life this man was ready to go but had only talked about end of life care with my mother and my grandmother. My mother happened to have MPOA. 

He fell, broke his hip and you all know the rest of the story. He was then intubated, was hard to get off the vent, sent to a LTAC and for weeks my family argued over how things would go while the brothers and sisters of my mother filed lawsuits against my mother since she was MPOA and my grandmother did not want to make a decision since they claim they never heard those wishes and that he was on benzos when he filled out any legal paperwork. Some of them kept leaning on data like his stress test looked good a year ago or his MRi brain was perfect a year ago.

In the end, my grandfather died of pneumonia, never woke up, and it ripped a family apart. Not to mention about 2 months worth of ICU stay.

I tried to speak up during this but only got pushed away and eventually legal contacts from their lawyers to basically stay out of this or else risk being sued and even a phone call where he threatened to report me to the board for offering medical advise without being the attending physician. 

Looking through the bills from the hospital stay that medicare paid for, it totaled well over 200k for the last month of his life. That doesn't include the stress tests that were done and all the other Rxs he had prior to his death.

This whole situation has really hit home for me for my elderly patients. Now I don't wait to their annual physical to ask about advanced directives. I have seen first hand how it ripped an extended family apart and caused the slow painful death of a man who for years would tell me and my mother that he didn't want that.

I don't blame any particular individual in this case. Everyone including myself could have done better and in a way contributed to the eventual outcome. I just wanted to share my story for you fellow docs can put a bit of realness to what happens when shit isn't documented and hopefully it might make us all take a second look rather than clicking that button (discussed advanced directives with patient to hit those medicare metrics).",medicine,t3_d5afwh

"Trying to find the interns' ""How to survive the ER...""So, for the last three weeks I've been working as a surgical intern in the Norwegian equivalent to the British ""Foundation year 1"". In our system, medical graduates must complete 1 year of hospital rotation (6 mo surgery + 6 mo medicine, or 4 mo surgery + 4 mo medicine + 4 mo psychiatry) and then further 6 mo of general/family medicine before being eligible for surgical/medical residency.

I've started at a mid-sized general hospital and my work is primarily in the ER. Doing diagnostics, stabilizing/treating and either admitting orthopaedic/gen. surgical patients for further diagnostics/treatment or discharging stable patients who don't require hospitalisation.

While I do have residents and senior doctors to confer with, most of the time the interns are the only doctors from the surgical department present in the ER.

And the ER is bloody busy. I'm especially struggling with:

1) creating a sustainable and effective system to keep track on the multiple patients I'm in charge of at any given time (their problems, vitals, workups, working diagnosis, initial treatment in the ER etc). Do any of you have any cool templates you could share with a funky fresh intern?

2) documenting effectively. In average I spend 10-15 minutes with one patient, and then 30-40 minutes writing the patient note and filing charts - and that's just not efficient enough. Especially when there are four other patients I've not yet examined.

3) doing an effective neuro exam in head trauma patients, especially elderly who've syncopated. What do you ER-docs/neurologists/neurosurgeons believe are the minimum requirements in an initial neurological assessment?

"Learning opportunity: what is the solution to abuse in residency?So I posted a different topic yesterday and let’s just say it went a little sideways. Did some reading, called some attendings, feel like this is a worthwhile discussion.

Where my bias comes from is a product of my generation and training so let my lay my framework and see if we can reach some mutual understanding. Grew up in the eighties, it was a different time. Words back then didn’t carry the same social stigma now that they did then not to say the people hearing it weren’t hurt by it. Also, as a guy, ribbing each other was constant and could get cruel and mean but most everybody got along. Bullies were usually physically intimidating or small guys with larger than themself personalities. Trained in a community hospital and now work in a University hospital and community hospital. 

In training we had three abusive attendings and one I didn’t get along with. One, let’s call him Dr R would get off the handle and berate some of my seniors. I never saw the wraith but after commiserating with a colleague we could see how bad it could be for some people. My response when I had interns was to prepare them for his pimping and step in and take the fall if they didn’t have the answer. He once yelled at an intern who was 6+ ft and when the intern stood up he walked away. The other was a Dr J, he was just a cantankerous little doc and he once berated an attending from behind thinking it was an intern and was mortified when they turned around. Still remember what she said, you shouldn’t apologize to me because I’m an attending, you just shouldn’t talk to anybody that way. There was a Dr C who wasn’t ever verbally abusive but you wouldn’t get the same teaching if he didn’t think you werent interested. Amazing teacher though if you got his teachings. The only one I didn’t get along with, not to say people got along with me, was a Dr M who started yelling at me when I shielded my interns. Well, we got into it, told her that the only people with a right to yell at me are my parents, that ended with a meeting with the associate program director and a truce. We never really got along after that but remained professional. Program director never put up with it and let’s just say they won they lost the battle but won the war. 

Now at work, there are some people who are, who carry a reputation for being real tough/mean. Most trainees who finish that rotation actually love them and remain in correspondence in their professional careers. Most others are generally nice and well-liked. Definitely there are surgeons around and senior fellows who carry unbecoming dispositions but by and large it seems things are ok. Here’s where my gap in understanding this comes. We have been having memos going around about abuse and microaggressions and so it must be an either large group of residents or a very vocal minority who don’t feel how I do. I’m about ten years out of training. 

As for me, my teaching style is best described, from my reviews, as not hands-on enough to gives great autonomy. I do morning rounds but don’t bedside round on all cases. I give short related talks to the case at hand. I give afternoon teaching sessions on Bayes theorem and the mathematical nature of diagnosis, biomed stats talks, ethics talks, billing, and whatever clinical stuff they are in to. I never make them feel small at the bedside, I don’t round in front of other teams, and I lay out very concrete expectations. I don’t generally give feedback at the end of the week but pepper it along as we go. I don’t sandwich. I take a more coach athlete approach. I’m a very happy person but have been told by friends I may be mean sometimes. I like Dr Cox from scrubs but no better than to be him. 

So surveys from 1990 and more recently show basically the same thing. Residents feel abused, about 20%, consistently, and 80% of graduating residents feel they have been abused at least once. Work hours remain long but are down from the past. Doctors continue to commit suicide at much higher rates then the public. I won’t even begin to speak about sexism since I’m not a woman but I’ve seen it and heard about it and it remains a problem. 

So thanks for getting this far, that being said:

To what extent is the abuse a systemic problem? To what extent is it a problem of individuals?

At what point does the feelings of the abused an internal problem and not an external problem? This is not a generalization and I understand it’s a very nuanced problems.

What factors such as sleep deprivation, large quantity of material to learn, emotional stress of practicing medicine/surgery play into augmenting the feelings of being abused?

What is the true role of medical education?

What does my generation not understand? Not speaking for all of us. 

Is physician burn out a system problem or a personal problem? Since it isn’t a binary problem, where on the spectrum are we?

What do we do about it?",medicine,t3_d4srnp
"To those of you entering the profession or working your way here, the art of medicine is more important than the science of medicineThere is no doubt you will be well educated and well trained in the science of medicine. Statins post stroke, pneumovax to reduce lung abscesses, CAR-T for cancer, but I want you to start focusing on the human condition. This is not an exhaustive list by any means but is a start at how we should think of our fellow humans. I’m a hospitalist so I will try to only speak to what I know. Other specialties feel free to add.

Alcohol is not a problem. It is a solution to a problem. Don’t get frustrated that the alcoholic won’t stop if we don’t help with the problem.

On hospital day three of their pneumonia admission, your ten point review of systems is a lie. I propose a ten point review of who they are. Knowing who they are can sometimes give you better insight to their illness and sometimes just make the relationship stronger. Example, my dying cancer patient loved Texas hold em, playing a couple hands on day 20 before he died was more important than any ROS, exam, or meds I could give him.

Everybody around you is unique with their own anxieties and problems. That person who just got off the elevator, they might have just lost their newborn. That person who slammed the bathroom door might have just found out their spouse has cancer, that angry nurse might have a kid with special needs at home, that person holding up the cafeteria line might have just been told that their partner has Alzheimer’s. Be kind to everybody, the hospital is a very special place.

Don’t turn your back to the patient and type. Don’t stand up hovering over the bedside. Don’t not give silence a chance. These things are way more important than an S3. 

Don’t overvalue the risk of death. Specifically speaking about PEGs. Sometimes it’s ok to accept aspiration if death is not valued over eating. Better yet, don’t villainize vices at the end of life.

Opiates treat pain but cause suffering. Unless you are dying. BZDs cause way more anxiety when you try to remove them than the anxiety you were trying to treat in the first place.

Don’t lie to your patients. If they don’t take their asa, they won’t die. Learn how to couch it better or analogize it better. The odds are in their favor if they don’t take asa, but if they didn’t take it and got an MI would they regret it? Then it’s a discussion about regret mitigation. Whatever their choice, you’ll both be less frustrated and they will feel more respected and you will get more respect. Don’t lie.

Short of physically assaulting you, any abuse you get from patients or families is usually not personal and is the expression of the vulnerability and fear. Do stand up for yourself but give them the benefit of the worst of ourselves when dealing with the betrayal of our bodies.

Your career is an ongoing prospective trial with an n of one. Your value is standing up for the 95% of your practice that you can back up with your own well reasoned decisions. Don’t be dogmatic. 5% of your value comes from the margins of cognitive dissonance. If you don’t look, you will never see.

You are the right person for the job.

Last but most important. On death. We all die. We don’t all die the same way. Sometimes we die slowly on a vent and suffer to give our family the time to come to peace. Sometimes we take chemo for regret mitigation other times because we want our kids to know we didn’t quit even though we know we are dying. Sometimes our lives are robbed in the night and our families never get to say goodbye. The discussion around and about death is the most nuanced discussion you will ever have. Put your values aside. Ask questions and listen. Their motivations for delaying death are sometimes very meaningful and understandable even if you don’t agree with it. Don’t place the burden of removal of life support on the family, it’s not fair. Love and fear cannot hear reason.

The day you have no anxiety walking through those hospital doors is the day you hang it up.

Edit1: none of this is to say 95% of our job is not science a delivery of sound and safe practices. It’s in the margins of our job where science doesn’t explain the humanity of us all that we strive to excel and are called upon to deliver compassion. For the health of our patient yes, but also, more importantly, for our own health.

Edit2: my take on the abuse of residency isn’t a justification of other docs shitty behavior towards residents. If we accept the reality of shitty people and focus on learning how to face it we will have trained more resilient physicians. If you get humiliated during morning report, GOOD, take inventory of your ability to present and the holes in your knowledge. But it isn’t  advice to not stand up for yourself. Standing up for yourself doesn’t always mean going toe to toe with a curmudgeon, sometimes you stand up for yourself by being a better version of yourself. I have worked with all kinds of attendings, the ones with pure animus are far and few between. But on the wards in a high stakes environment tempers will fly. Again not at all advocating for the abuse of another human being. I am advocating for the training of resilient human beings facing incredible odds.",medicine,t3_d4ard6
"Pet peeves within your own specialty.I'm on call and it's an issue grinding my gears at the moment. 

There's some neurosurgeons who do 100% spine. They have absolutely zero interest in anything in the cranium; however, some of them take general neurosurgical emergency call. 

Anything cranial becomes a watch and wait with some, when a trip to the OR is clearly in the patient's best interest. Fortunately at one referring facility, in their ED, most of the time the EM staff and/or neurologists (unfortunately later) initiate the transfer for surgery.

"What is the protocol for sexual assault cases who want a proper exam in your hospital?I am a resident at a large tertiary center in a major city. I was shocked to learn that despite at least 5 Level 1 trauma centers in relative close proximity to another, all but 1-2 have personnel qualified to do a rape kit.

At our facility, a patient reporting sexual assault is given a cab voucher, then sent off across town.  Prior to an exam. If they’re hemodynamically unstable we keep them....and I don’t think anyone physically comes to the hospital. From what I’ve been told, no one follows up to be sure that the patient ever made it to the next hospital if they get a cab.

I have been to other places where SANEs travel to various hospitals when needed, rather than forcing a patient to go elsewhere. I assumed that was the norm.

A system that puts an assaulted patient alone and in a vulnerable position going door to door of EDs with a random cabbie seems bizarre when they’re so vulnerable and haven’t gotten a proper workup.  What is it like in your place?",medicine,t3_d4b9f9

"Thoughts on new California law requiring 3 years of residency training to be eligible for MD license?[Starting in 2020, licensing rules for MDs in California will change](https://www.mbc.ca.gov/Licensees/2020_Changes.aspx). Instead of being eligible for state medical board certification after completion of intern year, new MDs will have to complete 3 years of residency training in order to apply for a full license. 

I am having trouble seeing this change in anything other than negative terms. First, this rule only applies to MDs. As far as I can tell, some providers such as NPs will still be able to obtain full prescribing privileges immediately after completing their graduate programs. 

Second, this would prevent MDs who decide not to continue with residency past intern year from obtaining prescribing privileges. Before, MD's with an intern year completed could choose to pursue other career paths, while retaining the ability to work part time in something like urgent care to help pay off loans or on a volunteer basis. This will no longer be possible without 3 total years of post-graduate training. 

Just wondering what others think about this change.",medicine,t3_d3m2m2
"Hospitalists—what’s your average census?My wife started a new job as a hospitalist in a smaller community hospital. She’s the first hospitalist they’ve had—prior to this, the IM docs saw patients before clinic and took call while in clinic. 

They just started the program this week and it’s been busier than she was told to expect. She’s rounding on 25+ patients each day, and doing 6-8 admits &amp; 5-6 discharges each day, plus the occasional consult. She’s also responsible for all the ICU patients during the day, there’s no in-house intensivist. 

She has some midlevel support, but they are all new-grad NPs. Additionally, the hospital’s policy is that the MD has to attest all of the midlevel notes, so they don’t really help cut down on the workload too much just yet.

This got my thinking a bit because there's quite a few diseases my animals are routinely vaccinated for that there is no human vaccine available for.

My horse is vaccinated every spring for Eastern, Western and Venezuelan Encephalitis and West Nile. Dogs on the east coast get vaccinated for Lyme and some dogs also get vaccinated for lepto. Clearly there is the ability to make these vaccines so why is there no human equivalent? I'm sure part of it has to do with exposure and risk--an animal spends more time outside and is more likely to be exposed to some of these diseases.

"Healthcare workers with chronic conditions - how do you do?Hey guys!

I would be curious in getting some input from fellow collegues that are working in the healthcare sector, especially from those with known chronic conditions which may affect you in your every day life.

Currently I'm in a residency program in the EU. I've been diagnosed with narcolepsy (without cataplexia) during the second year of medschool. My employer does not know about any preexisting conditions and I'd like to keep it that way, so meedit seems to be a good way to get anonymous feedback.

Thanks to treatment I'm doing alright and am glad that I finally have something, that I can pin my tiredness and sleep attacks on to. Outside of the hospital I'm trying to keep an active lifestyle (sports etc.), as long as my hours allow it. 

Still, I'm wondering ... how do my collegues handle their chronic conditions - for better or worse? 
There are days where everything goes smoothly and days, where I'm just tired as hell, without having changed my daily regiment beforehand. If anyone wonders, for this sort of situations I usually keep a coffein blister in my scrubs. 

As written earlier, my employer does not know about this condition, since I'm skeptical of eventual reprimands and suspicioun about my person (e.g. 'can he really handle that? what if he gets too tired, isn't able to stay alert ...' etc.).

If you are willing to share your personal expierences with your condition (whatever it may be) in the work enviroment (or beyond), I'd be glad!",medicine,t3_d00ul3

"Insurance eligibility and denials with prescription drugsI apologize if this post doesn't apply to community rules. If not, I will remove.

I am curious to hear how burdensome insurance eligibility and denials are for those in the medical community. Specifically coverage for prescription drugs. As a pharmacist, it is frustrating to see loads of prescriptions not being covered or just too expensive to the point the patient won't take it. Do those who prescribe experience a lot of issues with prior authorizations, having patients contact the office saying something is too expensive, or finding alternative medications when not covered? Do you have any reliable resources to know prior to prescribing if something is covered and for how much? Is it easy to use? I know there are some 'real-time benefit checks' out now, but not sure how well they work.

I am developing a platform that will present this information at the point of care.

"What is the right thing to do here? Hospital personnel with ethical concerns for a violent, disoriented geriatric pt who is now, out of necessity, almost always restrained.I'm on a floor where the population post-leadership/administration transition has been changing. Many beds have been closed and all staffing has become bare bones: RNs, MDs, CNAs and security. We've always had tough patients (many indigent, overall extremely noncompliant). Pts used to be mostly CHF, ESRD, COPD, sepsis, EtOH, with significant psychosocial issues, but not as severe as they are currently.

 As the year has progressed, it's as if we have been slowly accumulating (gero)psychiatrically unstable pts in the area while having fewer and fewer resources to address them, as personnel flee this situation. We've been unable to find placement for some of these pts due to histories of violence, even in nearby tertiary/quaternary care facilities. 

We're a small hospital without any locked wards. We can't even close the doors to some rooms as some have MCI/dementia and require bed alarms to keep them safe, particularly overnight.

I've expressed to nursing leadership that this has become a significant ethical issue, and they've said some variant of, ""I agree! You should bring that up with someone."" Mentally I respond to this with, ""I thought I just did.""

Although we've had several disturbing incidents, what troubles me currently is a pt who is almost continuously restrained now. He's not a sympathetic character: he's either hit, kicked, spit on, or tried to do some variant of those to all of our staff. He cannot be let out of restraints because he is a serious danger to himself or others: he immediately tries to escape and falls, attack staff, or worse, attempts to enter other pt rooms.

For whatever reason his care seems to get delegated to the midlevels, who don't seem to be confident or experienced enough to change his inadequate medication regimen. According to one of the RNs who has recently cared for him, telepsych said his issues weren't psychiatric in nature (??) so a psychiatric placement was not possible. He has been medically cleared for months to my understanding. 

He is terrifying the other pts with his constant screaming of threats and profanity. One pt called 911 because she thought there was a fight going on. Apparently several law enforcement officers rushed on to the floor, hands on guns, ready to go. 

I have offered earplugs to patients so they could sleep. One of them said, ""No, I need to be able to hear if that guy is coming to my room."" I thought this was chilling, and totally INSANE. It's not like I wouldn't throw my body in front of a pt to keep them safe, but for one, what if I'm not nearby? And more importantly, why should this even be happening??

There are other pts like this, honestly some incidents with others are just as, if not more, concerning (bomb threats, suicide attempts). But this guy has to be restrained and some personnel have started closing the door to his room so others can rest. It makes sense, but how disturbing is it to close the door on a restrained individual?? No matter how often you check on them.

Please help with your advice. We're trying our best, but I just feel like we have no backup. ",medicine,t3_cyimhb
"Emergency docs: How do you deal with the OD/alcohol excess patients in ED who stone wall you?Rotated into my ED job 3 weeks ago (in the UK you spend your 1st 2 years out of med school as a foundation doctor rotating through jobs every 4 months before entering a specific specialty training programme once you've had a taste of various specialities.)

As title states. I'm a hospitalist, newly grad from residency, and just out in the work force. My first week on as a hospitalist didn't turn out too well. Had a CODE blue cardiac arrest on me. 
Cannot say that I predicted it but had a feeling the patient was the sickest on my census. It's easier to look back and think of what I should have done earlier, but in the moment it appears as if nothing like this was coming. 

I have dealt with death before and cases going the wrong way. However this one in particular hits me hard especially as an Attending and first time on the job. 
Starting to make me doubt why I choose the field I am in. Make me think to switch career. Not a great feeling. No SI/HI so don't worry but def confidence in myself in the toilet. I know I'm a good physician, I know I'm not the best out there but I work really hard to get where I am.

"Hypothesis on the ""mid-level creep"" and an argument as to why APPs should not be held responsible for itAs I move through training and become exposed to more and more APPs, I do so within the context of the changing landscape of medicine. I did residency in a place where there weren't a lot, and I am now doing fellowship in a place where there are more. In doing this I've been forming comparisons between how it used to be and how it is, but instead of focusing on how things are different I have focused on how they are the same. So I wanted to see if we could get a discussion going in the room about this.

What's the same -and what is the main problem in medicine IMO- is that we see too many patients. Hospitals are too full. Censuses (censes?) are too high. Teams are stretched thin. In Raiders of the Lost Ark there's a quote, ""It's not the years, it's the mileage."" To adapt that for our situation: it's not the hours, it's the workload. 

What I'm seeing is APPs shouldering huge amounts of this workload. Sometimes there are triage systems in place for the types of cases they will get, but more often it is just whoever is open to take a case. You can't give someone such a high workload without expecting them to be able to make some independent decisions, so naturally that becomes part of the job. 

So my hypothesis is a mind-numbingly simple one and I'm embarrassed it took me so long to think of it: **if you treat someone like an independent clinician, they are going to want to be treated like an independent clinician.**

You want someone to run a case behind the curtain in the OR for 99% of the surgery? Yeah they're going to feel and want to be seen as anesthesiologists. You want someone to open, close, and assist through the entirety of the case, *and then* round on the patient for periop care? Yeah they're going to feel and want to be seen as junior surgeons. You want someone to see 5 consults a day? Yeah they're going to feel and wanted to be seen as consultants. 

Medical societies here and there keep explicitly writing this message, to paraphrase, that physicians are the most capable at independent practice and for patient safety. Yet the *implicit* message is completely the opposite of that. So this is not PAs and NPs wanting to be something they aren't. It's them wanting to be something they are already mostly being! Imagine having the title ""physician assistant"" only to find you are doing 90% of what a physician does. Do you feel like an assistant? How can we blame them for no longer liking that title?

I'm sorry for the long missive, but its borne out of utter resentment for the administrators trying to squeeze so much work out of all of us. And in doing so, we have these strange little issues pop up that end up breeding dissent in this unique workplace.

""Admins"" is a nebulous boogeyman term. I don't know that it's their fault. But I'll tell you one thing, somebody is happy about all this. They are happy about getting someone to do 90% of the work for 50% (or less) of the cost. But instead of using that model to make work easier on us, they use it to get us to work *more* and generate more profit. We as docs aren't happy about that. The APPs aren't happy. Patients certainly aren't happy. Whoever feels like this is just a fine situation, that's who should be held responsible.",medicine,t3_cx0bf0
"Doctors who deal with toddlers frequently, how do you get them to cooperate during a physical evaluation?I'm an MD working in a children's clinic, and some days ago I had a toddler patient who threw a tantrum anytime I tried to examine her belly.

In the end her dad had to go buy a cookie and I was able to finish the physical while she ate. 

My usual routine is to first auscultate, either with the toddler sitting on his/her own or in parent's lap, if they cooperate examine abdomen limbs, etc, and finally examine oral cavity, because that's usually the part when they get annoyed/start crying.

"Industry-funded Studies and Positive Outcomes - An ExplanationI just wanted to make a comment and start a discussion about a concept that is pervasive on podcasts, here on Meddit, and generally everywhere non-Pharma, which is that industry/Pharma sponsored trials meet their primary efficacy endpoints far more often than investigator-initiated or other randomized, controlled trials, and this makes them seemingly ""less valid or lower-quality evidence"". 

As someone very experienced with translational medicine from early Phase 2 to late Phase 3, there is a *likely* reason for this which is never discussed and therefore leads to a systemic and extreme bias against industry studies. 

The regulatory framework in the US under the FDA is extremely thorough, detailed, rigorous, and governed by Federal statutory laws as well as FDA rules and regulations.  In order to even be allowed to run a Phase 3 study for approval (what we call a ""pivotal trial""), the FDA has to agree to:  

* The overall design   
* The inclusion/exclusion criteria  
* The study conduct   
* The draft protocol   
* The power assumptions and calculations   
* The primary efficacy endpoint as well as the draft statistical analysis plan  
* The choice of dose, including maximal effective dose, minimal effective dose, and maximal INeffective dose    

There are many cases where Pharma ignored this, and the FDA issued a ""refuse to file"" letter and the company could not even submit a New Drug Application. Thus, the studies were not considered ""adequate and well-controlled"".  

The FDA is concerned with exposing patients to a drug with unknown benefit, probable harm, and the risks/burden of participating in a clinical trial.  Therefore, the FDA requires that the study design and conduct be rigorously compiled to answer the primary efficacy question.  I have seen cases where it has taken years to arrive at a mutually-agreeable study design with the FDA. 

So you not only have Pharma scientists, clinicians, and statisticians working on the study (with their enormous resources), you have FDA scientists, clinicians, and statisticians (with their enormous resources and access to thousands of study results) also providing their input and guidance for the study.  Hence, because the way the regulatory framework is set up in the US, Pharma studies have far, far, more resources and people to be tapped into. 

Lastly, once studies are submitted to the FDA, the FDA writes their own statistical analysis plan and *runs their own analyses*.  They can make different choices about missing data, and adjusting for confounding variables.  All in all, if a trial is considered ""positive"" for labeling, two separate entities have analyzed the data in different ways and come to the same conclusion.  

If you want an example of where industry trials have almost never been positive, look at Alzheimer's.  Since 2010, there have been over 20 Phase 2 and 3 studies with anti-amyloid agents that ALL have been overwhelmingly negative, despite all of these resources and attempts.

"MDs: as a behavioral health provider, how can I help the families of my ID/DD clients prepare for appointments?I’m a behavioral health provider and often see clients who are minimally communicative (usually together with ID/DD), and also clients with normal or above-average IQ but clinically significant deficits in self-awareness to the point of being unable to describe symptoms well. 


In those normal IQ patients there are also theory of mind issues, so we run into things like the client never mentioning severe heartburn because they just didn’t ever stop to think that it’s not normal, answering “no” if asked whether it hurts to eat (because to them, “hurt” is an elevation over baseline, except their baseline is what we call “hurts”), giving incomplete (complete to them) answers to questions, BUT being able to give useful info if they are asked a perfectly worded question.  


To further complicate things, some clients also don’t understand very simple commands or they have severe behavioral issues that make things like blood draws or even blood pressure tests quite difficult. 


 I get a significant amount of time with the parents/caregivers both in-home and in clinic, and insurance generally allows (after some phone calls and letters) me to attend medical appointments with the clients if necessary. This is what I’ve been doing so far based on feedback from MDs:

* use therapy to address behavioral issues, prep for procedures (rehearse steps, desensitization when appropriate), determine accommodations (dimmed lights, appt after lunch), prioritize health communication (“point to where it hurts”) 
* make sure parents log basic health info BEFORE the dr visit (ideally 2 weeks of food/liquid intake, bx symptoms, sleep, general activity/engagement levels, BM/urine output)


Even with all that, the majority of medical appointments result in doctors saying they can’t assess and don’t know who to refer out to. This is a huge issue because it leads to situations like chronic constipation going untreated until it’s a full impaction needing inpatient care. Sometimes the necessary test can be identified (swallow study) but the MD says it’s impossible because the kid wouldn’t tolerate it... so instead they end up having to tolerate a feeding tube a few years later. 


There are some hospitals that have dedicated clinics for this population, but waitlists are long, they often require symptoms to have escalated to a certain point before even putting a family on the waitlist, many families don’t have the ability to take two weeks off of work to go to another state while their kid gets testing, and sometimes there’s no real option for followup care.  


What else can I do on my end to help these clients be able to get adequate medical care? Are there any behavioral skills that are especially helpful to make exams easier? Information to log that would give you a better idea of what’s going on?",medicine,t3_cwgqfp

Having a doctors coat is though still a privilege which is not easily given up. Some will always wear one, others hated it from the beginning. But at least here where i live (EU, Austria) there is a trend towards fewer coats i think.

&amp;#x200B;

Given the fact, that coats are way more unhygienic even negligent some might argue, i kinda asked myself: Are white coats still a thing?

Whats your take on that? Do you see a change towards less coats?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: 

Thanks for your responses. Also especially nice to have so many different perspectives from different countries. Seems to me as if US americans hold their coats in higher regards, while others transition away from it.

"Office paediatrics doesn't exist in the UK, would it be an answer to some of our problems?This subreddit is great for comparing systems around the world, especially as we don't really meet American doctors in the UK.

In the UK paediatric training takes place after 5-6 years of undergraduate medical school, 2 years of foundation (internship), working as a doctor in 4 month rotations, then you do 8 years of paediatric training. Within the next few years this may decrease to 7 years. After this you are a consultant (attending) in general paediatrics, managing outpatient clinics, acute takes, ward work, on calls.

Doctors work 48hr per week, as opposed to 100 (?) hour weeks in the USA.

Subspecialties in paediatrics also train in 8 years, but may have fellowship/phD years as well.

General practice (family medicine) takes place after your two years of foundation, and training takes 3 years, half in hospital, half in GP.

Many GPs will never have worked in a paediatric department, and will qualify having only done 5-6 weeks of paediatrics in medical school.

For day to day problems, GP is the gatekeeper, you bring your child to the GP first. You cannot see a paediatrician. There is no office paediatrician, this is not a role which exists. Paediatric consultants will have a routine wait of 3-6 months to be seen in clinic. 

There are not many paediatricians in the UK compared to GPs, and the paediatric college is not filling their training numbers so this will get worse.

As a result, if the GP is not trained in paediatrics, they will be very unsure, and refer children to paediatrics who could have been managed in the surgery. Which results in consultants who spent 8 years training in acute paediatrics managing constipation, coughs and colds, often in an assessment unit during antisocial hours.

In the UK we often talk about how great it would be to have some form of office paediatrician, maybe shorted training, only works 9-5 in an office, seeing children instead of the GP, preventing unnecessary referrals. This is what happens in the USA I understand?

It would seem to be a better system, offering an option of better work life balance for paediatricians, and better service for families than seeing a GP who does not have paediatric training. A GP for children.

Does it work in practice elsewhere in the world?

"Ondansetron and SSRI’sTLDR: Ondansetron and SSRI interactions and dangers

Hey all, 

Aussie Paramedic here seeking a decent explanation on the use of Ondansetron in someone who is prescribed SSRI’s (or any antidepressant that may have an effect on QTc)

 I have base fundamental pharmacology knowledge from uni, but it’s been awhile since I’ve touched my pharmacology textbook. Whilst I’m happy with interpreting most drugs individual pharmacodynamics/kinetics, I struggle to put into context how certain drugs interact with each other. 


It’s been reported to me that administration of Ondansetron in patients taking SSRI’s places them at an increased risk of prolonging their QTc and subsequently increasing chances of an R on T / torsades episode. In my practice, SSRI’s aren’t mentioned in contraindications or precautions for Ondansetron administration, and in my setting we’d always have them on cardiac monitoring - however, we are increasingly administering ondansetron in low-risk patients and leaving them at home / organising GP appointments for them at a later date. I don’t want to place anyone in any unnecessary danger if it can be avoided. Searching the drug interaction comes up with the potential life-threatening interaction and states to avoid combination, however I know that a good 60-70% of our patients are on SSRI’s (namely sertraline) and are given ODT ondans without a second thought. To my knowledge, Ondansetron doesn’t have a significant impact on QTc unless it is being administered intravenously (which we also do, however we don’t leave these patients at home). With the prevalence of SSRI usage and the relatively common prescription for ondansetron, I take it that if it was a huge issue it would be more prevalent in training / warnings. 

Essentially I’m looking for a dumbed down explanation regarding the interaction between the two drugs, and the actual risk of harm with co-administration. Any info would be greatly appreciated! 

Edit: As a side note, if anyone could elaborate on the usage of ondansetron in patients taking SSRI’s (or other antidepressants) +/- sympathomimetics and the risk of serotonin syndrome that would also be greatly appreciated.",medicine,t3_cv5mtv
"Hello meddit. I'm the radiologist who was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma a few years ago (rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated). It's been a while so I figured I'd give you guys an update.After a while of talking about everything on social media, I decided to take a break and live my life in the real world. I focused on working hard during my last year of residency. Over the past year I’ve been working as an attending, which is substantially more rewarding than being a resident (particularly, I think, for radiologists since we have such little autonomy as residents). And my wife and I are expecting our first child in a few months, so I'll get to be a dad, even if it's just for a little while. Honestly, if it weren't for my fungating cancer, my life would be great!

-

For those of you who never saw [my original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/51o49k/32_yearold_previously_healthy_male_presents_with/), I was diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma in February of 2016. I had extensive disease (my PCI was 31/39) so we decided to do a two-stage resection from the onset. The first surgery was in March 2016 and we did an extended right hemicolectomy, a cholecystectomy, splenectomy, omentectomy, and overall tumor debulking. We also did HIPEC with cisplatin, which unfortunately resulted in severe AKI. I was on dialysis for 3 months, and my kidney function has only recovered to around CKD 3b levels. There were other moderately serious complications that we addressed as they arose, but none of them were as significant as the kidney injury.

-

Between surgeries, we did intraperitoneal chemo with doxorubicin and carboplatin (alternating every other treatment) for about 8 cycles. The second surgery (November 2016) involved primarily a distal duodenal reconstruction (luckily the biliary tree wasn’t involved), another hemicolectomy, more debulking, and a second HIPEC. The second recovery went much more smoothly. However, we got a PET/CT a few months later, and there was some hypermetabolic activity associated with some soft tissue masses, so we started IV chemo with carboplatin, Alimta, and Avastin (early 2017). 

-

We did something like 10-12 cycles of that. The abdominal disease was stable during chemo, but two mediastinal nodules near the apex of my heart enlarged, so CT surgery took them out with a robotic assisted thoracotomy (August 2017). We continued on chemo until the side effects became too much to handle (March 2018). Things had been stable so we decided to take a break from full treatment and just do maintenance Avastin. The ""masses"" we were treating might not have been anything, either. They haven’t really changed to this day and are probably just granulation and/or scar tissue.

-

After the second surgery but while I was on chemo, I went back to work and finished my last year of residency. In July 2018 we moved so I could start my real job and to be close to my family. A group where my parents live was willing to hire me without doing a fellowship, and after everything that had happened, I didn’t want to spend another year of my life in training. Anyway, I continued Avastin down here every 3 weeks, but around November of 2018 new lesions showed up in my pancreas. It took a while to coordinate the surgery, but in February of 2019, I had a third ex-lap to try to do a distal pancreatectomy. It was unsuccessful due to the degree of adhesions from the other surgeries and HIPECs, and also complicated by two EC fistulas that took 4-5 months to fully heal. I was on TPN for 2-3 months after that, but they’ve finally healed and I’m eating and drinking normally again.

-

Unfortunately, the pancreatic masses continue to grow, so now it’s time to start looking into clinical trials. There are a couple up at the NIH that I’m looking into, and if those fall through there’s something starting at Ohio State soon that I’m hopeful I can get into. The one at NIH that I’m most interested in is a T-cell trial. It would be the first time trying it out on humans, from what I understand, but they’ve had good success with it in mice models of ovarian cancer. It targets mesothelin, which is over-expressed in both ovarian cancer and mesothelioma (among others), so there’s a good chance it might work. I’m already running into pushback from them because of my kidney function, but I’m hopeful we can figure something out and that they’ll let me into their trial.

-

Before you (or I) go feeling a bit too sorry for me (or myself), I want to tell you a little story to put things into perspective. A few weeks ago, the wife of one of the younger partners in my group – someone who was only in her early 30s – randomly had a heart attack and subsequently passed away a few days later. She had been totally healthy, right up until the point that she wasn’t. She and her husband have multiple young children. So, getting a cancer diagnosis isn’t the worst thing you might have to deal with.

-

There’s basically no circumstance in life that can’t be made infinitely worse by some other horrible tragedy. Whenever you start feeling too sorry for yourself because you’re dealing with some shit, just remember that you should be grateful for the blessings you do have. It could be worse. It can ***always*** be worse.

-

Feeling sorry for yourself is the road to despair. The situation in which you find yourself might be out of your control, but the attitude you take while dealing with that situation is entirely up to you. The only thing you can actually control in this plane of existence is yourself. Horrible, terrible things will eventually happen to you in your life, and they’ll cause you misery and anguish, but they can only destroy you if you let them. There’s a big difference between dying and being destroyed. I’m choosing not to be destroyed by this, even if it ends up killing me. 

-

There is an indomitable – dare I say Holy – spirit that resides within all of us, but you have to call it forth. You do so by accepting forthrightly the challenges that life has given you, with as much acquiescence to the facts of the matter as you can manage. I’m not saying that you’re magically going to get whatever you want in life. Far from it. But I *am* saying that you have the capability to withstand any challenge this world can throw at you. If you’ve never had to face some sort of awful tragedy in your life, just wait a while. You’ll eventually be facing the same kind of choice that I am, and you too will have a decision to make.

"Why are so many patients on benzodiazepines for long-term therapy to treat anxiety?I’ve been practicing in family medicine for less than 5 years, one common thing that I’ve struggled with is patients who come into the clinic taking a daily scheduled benzodiazepine to treat anxiety.  From my understanding benzodiazepines are not an appropriate or effective maintenance treatment for anxiety.  




Usually this patient has taken the medication longer than a year and it’ll be a shorter acting medication taken 3-4 times a day.  These patients are generally not taking what I would consider a maintenance medication (SSRI, SNRI, etc.).  The most confusing part is that many of them feel like their current therapy is ineffective yet are not willing to try starting a maintenance medication, CBT, and weaning off of the benzo.





My problem with the situation is that I feel like most of the patients are truly addicted to the medications, treatment is not effective, and I’m essentially being forced into a role of helping them continue their addiction or a stop along the way until they find someone who will continue their prescription. 




Is there really a role for daily benzodiazepines?  Do you have patients who use this type of medication as their primary treatment for anxiety?  Outside of offering to start a new medication, start CBT, and tapering off of the benzo over several months is there a better way to approach this situation?  





I’m especially frustrated today as I had a patient file a formal complaint last week because I reportedly disrespected them by not understanding the severity of their anxiety.",medicine,t3_cusiat

"Should speciality training applications give weight to non-medical extra-curricular achievements?

This is not universal in speciality posts in the UK. For paediatric subspecialities while applications support expressing a balanced work-life balance, it does not seek to reward unusual effort outside of medicine.

Do people think it's fair or desirable to prioritise these achievements? Does it produce good well rounded doctors, or does it encourage a lack of diversity in personalities in a field? I note there are no points for having a family, which may interfere with world class achievements elsewhere.

I would suggest that in a speciality with a lot of burnout like ICM, we should encourage a wide variety of personalities to work in the field, some of whom might be type-A perfectionists who seek to achieve perfection and achievements in all aspects of life, maybe we need some people who just go home, unwind, and chill, play games, play with their kids, go for a walk, whatever. If you get a lot of people with the same personality type in a department or speciality you will exclude other people who would make good doctors and help balance the team.

"Why are his legs swollen?So first of all- I am a nurse that has recently transferred into home care (UK) and there are no doctors whose brain I can just pick when they are around. However, I am still curious about the pathophysiology of why my patient's are poorly.


So.... PMH: 85 y/o male, smoker, COPD, TIIDM, hypertension, recently diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma and has undergone TACE for extension of life.


We go in this man's home every day for bilateral leg dressings. We put on every dressing possible, but it is not enough because the exudate is overwhelming. It looks like trench foot with the addition of necrotic toes. Without knowing any details about him I assumed that he has the typical kidney/heart failure combo as he had swollen legs, complained of swollen testicles, wasn't passing a lot of urine and well... just looked it (sorry).

Later on, through nursing assessment I figured out that he had a medication mixup and was taking up to 600mg of codeine a day. That resulted in a call to the GP and me accessing his medical notes. 

His eGFR is 90 and he had an echocardiogram last month(because the GP though he had HF too) but that was absolutely fine!!! The cardio consultant in his letter said that the symptoms are probably from HCC and existing co-morbidities.


**here is my question** Can someone please explain to my nursing brain in relatively simple terms, what pathophysiological processes can be happening for oedema to form secondary to liver cancer? 
He was taken to a hospital next day with new onset of chest pain, so I also know that his potassium and sodium were on the low side, but albumin, CRP were normal.

"Struggling working with midlevels during fellowshipJust started fellowship. I am having a hard time working with the midlevels.

I entered into it with the notion that these were going to be my peers. But what I'm finding more and more is that they completely look down on me. I feel like they think I'm an idiot. And now I'm starting to feel like an idiot.

You know how when a person is trying to speak a new language to a native speaker, the native speaker has a bias that the person is unintelligent because their grammar and pronunciation are incorrect? That's what's going on here. I am a newcomer, I don't know the EMR, I don't know the hospital, and I don't know the culture. But these midlevels have been here for years. And they will be staying for years more, while I'll be out relatively soon.

Oh and I obviously don't know the subspecialty. Duh. That's why I'm training in a fellowship. But they do. They know it more than me.

I would chalk this up to ego on my part. I'm willing to. But the other day I asked one of them for an opinion -like I would a peer- on a recommendation I should make. And you know what happened? I got pimped. Like a goddamn intern.

It's like my residency doesn't count for anything. Anytime I try to share an experience from residency that informs my practice, it is ignored by them, presumably because they don't care. Or maybe they think I'm trying to flex by talking about training they don't have. Do you know how simultaneously depressing and enraging that is? All that work? Those years? That sacrifice? To just shrug it off like it never happened? And to treat me like I know absolutely nothing?

I'm more depressed by this than I ever was in residency. We were collegial back then. No one cared if you didn't know something. They didn't Socratic method you if you asked a question, they just told you because that's what you do when you regard someone as an equal.

But at the same time I recognize they know more about what they are doing than I do right now. So maybe they are right. Maybe my residency no longer matter because, hey, whoever has been doing this longer is the one that knows the most.

Can someone please help me out with some perspective? I'm not looking to get confrontational with them or go to my PD or anything like that.

For context, I'm a primary care physician and the following information is from a colleague's patient.

Male 72yo.  PMHx of FA, CKD 3a (cr 1.8, eGFR = 37.78), hyperurecemia. Also, macular degeneration, oftalmologist suggests fluorescein angiography despite renal function. 

Opftalmologist argues that he has done this procedure many times to other patients with CKD with no complications.  On the other hand, internist suggests an alternative image (optical coherence tomography -OCT), as doing an angiography with the current creatine clearance of the patient, could lead to nephrosclerosis.  Additionally, the internist argues that although the patient's eGFR is not in the range to be considered a contraindication for an angiography (&lt;30ml/min) it is too close to it. She recommends an OCT if possible and as a last resort the fluorescein angiography if there is no other choice.

My colleagues and I were puzzled about this so we went ahead to revise the literature on topic but we couldn't find a lot of information on it. There are a few studies out there but they were a bit contradictory and we weren't able to agree.

&gt;Light information from retinal ganglion cells travels through the optic nerves, optic chiasm (where the nasal fibers decussate), and the optic tracts, before synapsing in the pretectal nuclei of the dorsal midbrain. Both pretectal nuclei receive input from both eyes. Each pretectal nucleus sends axons to both Edinger-Westphal nuclei.

How do I initiate making this improvement? without getting me ostracized.

"What to do for the patient who gets punted back and forth between clinic and the ER?Yesterday, a 70yo guy with diastolic CHF who had been hospitalized for exacerbation for 3 days earlier this month, came to see me for follow up (not my patient) after he was newly put on 2L O2 by urgent care 3 days ago for shortness of breath, spo2 85-88, told to increase his Lasix, given azithro which he kept forgetting to take. He was taking 60 bid PO lasix up from 40 bid for two days and had noticed his weight increase steadily from dry weight of 205 to 218 in my clinic yesterday. He kept telling me he felt slowly worsening SOB, and his wife said it was worse than earlier that month when they had been hospitalized, getting worse over the past few days. On my exam, he had very poor air movement so it was hard for me to tell if there were crackles or wheezing, but had 3+ putting edema to the calf (unclear what he was prior). I recommended he go to the ER for IV lasix which we don’t do in our clinic. He refused, so I had him sign an AMA paper and gave him strict ER precautions. 

I checked on his chart this morning and saw that he went to the ER at 3 AM, at which point the ER doc documented wheezing and crackles, said in his note there was “some concern about his weight in clinic”, gave him IV lasix x1 and sent him home. My concern is that now this guy has no trust in us and will continue not to listen to our advice, plus I don’t think this was the right management.

IV introduces more issues: potential for administration errors (extravasation, compatibility. Etc.) ,more fluid for the patient, occupation of the line if you have other IV meds going in, etc.  What's with the insistence on IV?

"What are your guys' opinions about Osteopaths.Osteopathy was a theme totally foreign to me. I honestly discovered that it even exists as a distinctive area of medicine two weeks ago. My brother's wife is currently studying it and was telling me about the ""miracles"" of manipulation, how one could cure almost anything through it. I had a unknown knee injury (now I know it is a severed ACL) and she was telling me about how my pain was referred in the knee, but the cause could be in the spine or in any structure other than the knee itself. It was ok until that. But she started telling me about visceral manipulation, and curing nervous and vascular diseases through it. She told me about some ""big-shot"" Osteopath that even restored a woman's fertility after realizing, through manipulation alone, that her ovaries were receiving ""less blood"" from it's main artery, and then, again through manipulation, he restored it's blood flow.

I mean, I tried not to be disrespectful or anything, but it surely looked like a bunch of pseudoscience to me. I tried to find articles about it, but sure ""osteopathy"" means ""bone disease"", so it was pretty hard to find one that didn't use the word in this sense. I saw information on other places regarding the absence of actual evidence that this type of therapy could treat visceral conditions. Combine that with my sister-in-law's telling me that the materials and references that they used are not available for anyone who doesn't goes through the course, and that makes a great case for Osteopathy being a kinda shady type of alternative medicine, akin to Chiropractic.",medicine,t3_cs4uy7
"Why is everyone so mad in the hospital?Warning long rant ahead:

1. Cross specialty. I've noticed that there is air of hostility among providers in our field. Naturally, this is most evident during consultations. As a personal anecdote, ED providers and ""list-heavy"" teams (think transplant surgery) are the most hostile in my opinion. As a senior level resident, I've persistently seen my juniors and interns field calls from individuals are short tempered, rude, and/or annoyed. Often times, the consulting team doesn't know what their specific question is. Furthermore, when discussing patients it almost seems as if clarifying questions are interpreted as hostile and seen as personal attacks. 

2. Nursing staff. I work at three different major hospitals and all have their own quirks. In particular at children's hospitals - it seems that nurses here take great pride and ownership over their kiddos (which isn't a bad thing by itself) and for the most part, it seems like they are really do understand the ""overall"" plan. However, with that said, I have met many which do not consider the physician as a major player in the patient's care and become almost ""possessive"" over their patient. Phrases such as ""don't touch MY patient"" or ""excuse me, who are you?"" are often spoken in a deeming, rather than an inquisitive tone. It's frustrating to hear things such as this and honestly a little disrespectful, especially when you've just spent 8 hours doing a complete laryngotracheal reconstruction.

3. Patients. Honestly, not sure what to say about this one. Maybe I've had a bad stretch, but the number of patients who simply do not trust physicians or have convinced themselves that their doctors have ulterior motives is very baffling to me. Furthermore, the number of demeaning comments towards residents directed towards the  sex, race, or age (e.g. ""you're too young to be a doctor"") seems to be increasing.

"Suspected munchausen by proxy in mother of my patientI'll try to be as descriptive as I can without going too deep, but this is a bit lengthy.

I have a patient that I am often assigned to. This patient has an order for 1:1 safety advocate(sitter) 24/7 due to behavioral issues/mental retardation (IQ&lt;70). Current hospital stay began when mom brought in patient to ED for behavioral disturbances/aggression. Come to find out patient had been in an adult group home successfully managing patient's psychiatric issues and behavioral disturbances, when mom suddenly and without explanation removed patient from home and suddenly stopped all psych meds. Since then patient has been in and out of hospitals for primarily behavioral issues but also, per mom, various medical problems (everything from brain tumors to pancreatic cancer, all unfounded). Each time nothing is found to be wrong other than meds need to be adhered to.

As of now, mom is POA, but APS is working on a case to have that removed as MSBP is suspected due to exaggerated patient symptoms, falsifying diagnoses hx, and requesting completely unnecessary and stressful tests and operations (such as a brain biopsy). Since nothing has been done legally yet mom still gets visits, but per psychiatry visits are limited and 100% supervised. Mom can be asked (usually forced) to leave when her behavior starts aggravating patient. On several occasions mom has amped up her child's behavior to the point that the patient violently assaults staff. Several have been sent to the ED for this.

With altered medication regimen, patient's psych status has greatly improved. Behavioral outbursts are now limited to specific and very understandable triggers. However every time mom comes for a visit patient gets aggravated and mental stability declines. Always ends in either crying or assaulting staff. Usually just the former if Mom leaves before things get out of hand. Patient has voiced feeling neglected and abused by mom, has stated fear over mom's presence and control over patient's medical wishes. Despite all this mom still gets to visit.

My question is, as a sitter and the supervisory staff for her visits, at what point can I make her leave? I can tell when patient is getting worked up, but currently mom is only asked to leave when patient has gotten completely out of control and security is called to help with patient behavior. I have heard during several conversations between the two mom telling her child that she's dying, there's something seriously wrong, her meds are killing her, etc, and when Mom leaves we're stuck doing damage control. Patient clearly loves mom, fears her to a degree, but does not have the mental capacity to understand what's going on. Patient sometimes feels that we are holding patient prisoner and accusing mom of abusing patient (mom tells child that mom's being denied rights, we're stopping her from ever seeing patient again because we're evil, all to purposely get patient worked up), but patient will then acknowledge the decayed mental state of mom and how mom being around isn't good for her.

As I'm at the bottom of the totem pole I don't know where my abilities lie in controlling the situation. I personally feel like mom should have no visitation rights, but I'm in no position to be making that decision. In the least it's obvious the harm her visits are doing and it's so painful to watch the patient psychologically suffer like this. I just don't know what to do in the meantime while things are being sorted out legally.",medicine,t3_cruj4f

"Opinions on Value Based Care?There's been a trend in value based care companies recently and I'm curious what you all think of them. 

For anyone unaware, 

&gt;Value-based care is a form of reimbursement that ties payments for care delivery to the quality of care provided and rewards providers for both efficiency and effectiveness. This form of reimbursement has emerged as an alternative and potential replacement for fee-for-service reimbursement which pays providers retrospectively for services delivered based on bill charges or annual fee schedules. [1](https://revcycleintelligence.com/features/what-is-value-based-care-what-it-means-for-providers)

The way I understand it, a value based care company will act as both the insurance provider and the primary care provider for a patient. The patient pays their insurance premium month by month and does not pay fee-for-service type payments for any of their care. 

Its up to the providers to make sure the tests being done and the interventions being performed are strictly necessary and beneficial because the companies' profits are now tied to how expensive these tests and interventions are rather than how many billing codes the doctor can tie to a patient.

"A 4 step plan to improve healthcare in the United StatesNote to mods: in spite of my username, this is not a throwaway account.

I'm interested to hear everyone's thoughts. I think we can drastically improve healthcare in the US with a few simple changes, four to be exact.

Criticism of M4A: In general, I'm against Medicare-for-all. I think there are some good things about the system, but I think there are some bad ones as well. If you are curious about how single payer healthcare would work in the US, look at the VA system. I think M4A would be like having the VA everywhere. I think Medicare-for-all makes things better for one group only - patients who currently have trouble affording healthcare. For everyone else including patients who currently can afford their healthcare as well as providers, I think things would be worse under a Medicare-for-all system. I think that holding up personal freedoms, opening the door for individual exceptionalism, and putting more responsibility on individuals to make good personal choices are some of the values that sort of define the United States and none of those values are well supported in a Medicare-for-all system. Furthermore, I think that Medicare-for-all requires a drastic overhaul of our current system and there are sure to be significant growing pains. I think we can do better. I think we can get healthcare to everyone who needs it while preserving the majority of our current system and supporting values like individual freedom, opportunities for individual exceptionalism, and personal responsibility.

So here's my plan:

1. **Transparent pricing of healthcare services**. Anyone who renders healthcare services should be required to clearly, simply, and publicly disclose the price for those services. This not only includes clinics and hospitals, but pharmacies. Some patients would use this information to shop around for cheaper care, some wouldn't. *Many* doctors would use this information to reduce the cost of care for their patients. Aggregate/comparison sighs would quickly pop up so that you can just type in what service you want and it will show you all the local places that provide that service and how much it costs. I do think that this would help to drive down the cost of care in the US. Whenever healthcare is consumed or provided, the two people who should have the BEST idea of what that care costs (the patient and the provider) often have no clue what it will cost until after it is processed by the healthcare institution and insurance company.
2. **A national EMR**. If I access the chart for John Doe in San Francisco, I should get all the same information that I would get if I accessed their chart in Boston. In order to provide the best possible care, I need to have accurate information about what tests have been done, what medications you are on, what diagnoses you have, etc. Patient self-report can be unreliable, HIPAA is restrictive, and it is 2019 yet we are still faxing important medical information. In order to cause minimal disruption and preserve individual EMR vendors, the national EMR would be simply the backend. All EMRs, regardless of who makes that EMR, retrieves and stores medical information in the same national backend/database using a common, agreed upon format. Individual EMR vendors can then create a product that accesses, displays, and allows interaction with that information in ways that are unique to the needs of each individual healthcare institution. Think of the internet - the backend is the same, but how you access it (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE) is different and can provide additional layers of benefit on top of the information you are accessing. A national EMR should work like that. I think that this aspect, above all else, would have the most growing pains. But by preserving individual vendors, they may be able to transition where that information comes from without causing a significant disruption of your daily workflow.
3. **HSAs for all**. Ben Carson's plan from 2016 was a bit like this. Every citizen should have an HSA they can contribute to. Anything contributed to the HSA can be spent on ""healthcare"", and we can let that be a fairly broad range of things including spending your HSA money on the monthly premium for health insurance. The type of health insurance you have would not affect your HSA in any way. Contributions still reduce taxable income, just like today, but yearly limits would be much higher. HSA money can be passed on through a will and can be transferred between the accounts of family members. In general, #1 above and #3 here would create more opportunity for people to pay cash for services, reducing the bloat of a system that requires a 3rd party payer. If someone does not have health insurance, there is no penalty, but if they need emergency medical services a lean can be placed against their HSA so that contributions are garnished until debt is paid off.
4. **A national public insurance option**. Some people, based on income, age, disability status, etc automatically qualify for it, but anyone can have it if they want. If you don't automatically qualify, there is a monthly fee just like any insurance company. The care covered by this national insurance then can provide a competitive standard by which all private insurers will be compared against. If the cheap national insurance covers pre-existing conditions, it would be hard for a private insurer to get any business without also covering pre-existing conditions. This allows for a loosening of restrictions on private insurers by letting the market drive what standards they need to adhere to regarding coverage. Between this option and the HSAs for all, the door is now open to a ""universal if you want it"" model where the federal government can deposit funds into HSAs for all Americans every month equal to the monthly cost of the public option. If you want to use those funds to buy the public option you can, but you can also use those funds to buy private insurance or just save them and pay cash for services.

I think these options can each, if enacted in isolation, improve our current system. None of them are too controversial and take a fairly middle-ground politically. I think these changes would make things better, yet allow for continued personal choice/freedom, allow for individual doctors to do their own thing and charge cash for it if they want, and it allows the patient to be the one in charge of their healthcare, not an insurance company.",medicine,t3_cqexvr
"Is there any reason why a doctor's office could/should/would refuse to provide a patient's medical diagnosis to a pharmacy?Story: I had a prescription sent in to my pharmacy today for a 10 year old patient for naltrexone tabs. Naltrexone! Having never seen this prescribed to a peds patient before, I called this doctor's office to 1) confirm the medication was correct and 2) ask for a diagnosis code and medical reason for this patient to document it in our medical record. The medical assistant who called back confirmed they did want this medication but said the doctor was refusing to disclose the medical reason/need for naltrexone, to ""just go ahead and it would be safe to fill it"", and to simply call the mom (who has no medical background) for questions about the medication. Why would that be? For context, this is a ""performance, sports medicine, and metabolism"" clinic, and NOT a pediatrician's office.

What would be the reason, if any, you would want to withhold medical information about a patient to the pharmacy that is dispensing their medication?

To put it in the perspective of the pharmacist, having ICD-10 codes provide some insight to pharmacies and context as to why certain medications are being used in different populations, like when Flomax is used in women for kidney stones, or cis-men getting estrogen patches to help with chemo side effects.  In addition, my state board of pharmacy actually requires medical diagnoses and ICD-10 codes to be noted in a patient's record when filling scripts. You can actually get ""ding'd"" in a board inspection for failing to do so (i.e., giving insulin to a patient but not having diabetes listed on the file, inhalers to a patient but no asthma/COPD diagnosis, etc). I am sure that many pharmacists will tell you they do not like filling scripts blindly or without cause, and since many retail/community pharmacies do not have access to provider chart notes, a simple medical diagnosis is a quick way to check if a medication may or may not be appropriate for the patient. 

I am posting this to the medicine subreddit to see if any providers might have any input for me. I will say that 99% of the providers I have worked with have had no problem discussing medical treatment of a patient with the pharmacy.",medicine,t3_cq6jih

"What do medical professionals want to know about nutrition?Hi, I'm a PhD in public health and adjunct professor with training in health behavior and nutrition science.  I have been involved in a few curriculum meetings at a large medical school in New York State, and what I have come to learn from that experience and more research on my own is that most medical students are exposed to very little nutrition education, unless they seek it out themselves.  What I want to do is create workshops/ lunch and learns as an add-on for medical schools, where I can provide students with evidence-based real-world nutrition knowledge and skills that they can easily pass onto their patients.  This has the potential to evolve into programs for doctor's offices and hospitals.   
 This would be not for profit, as I value education much more than making money.  I just want to help future doctors (and current doctors) help their patients understand basic nutrition.  I hope this is not viewed as self-promotion, I just want feedback from the medical community.  I also don't want to come off as arrogant or sound like I'm assuming doctors don't understand nutrition, I just want to help with the translation to the patient.

"Hahnemann’s residency slots fetch $55 million in bankruptcy auction[Here is the story](https://www.inquirer.com/business/hahnemann-university-hospital-residency-slots-55-million-20190809.html).

The Residency slots from the now dead program generated a ton of money, and also there is the strong possibility [the land could make them even more](https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/29/economy/hahnemann-hospital-closing-philadelphia/index.html).  

Say what you will, and believe that ""at least they get to keep their training position"", however, positions for actual people, training physicians, *are being sold at auction.*    

And for some inside information to those outside whats happening on behalf of those who are prohibited from revealing information as to how local programs are handling the loss of 30-50 residents per institution:

Abington-Jefferson hospital alone lost ~44 residents.  They are being supplemented by Attendings from Jefferson Hospital, AND any Jefferson Network physician in the local area HAS to do at least one 6 hours shift at Abington-Jefferson.  So far, this is not going well. Some Attendings in this mess are so overwhelmed that they are threatening to hand off their patients and leave.  Additional people are needed to literally follow around and help Attendings just to enter Pharmacy orders to prevent mistakes and triple the workload.  

There is no active plan in place for the next year for back filling these slots, and there will be no increases in any Pharmacy positions or residency positions either.  

Several ""Sentinel Events"" have occurred during this transition between the major Philadelphia hospitals affected by this.  

And finally word from the inside is trickling out that this might be a fantastic template to use for a Residency strike.  Several hospitals are almost internally crippled, and with no solid long-term contingency plan for something of this magnitude, a well-timed strike of Residents could devastate a system to the point of near insolvency.

"Cardiologists/Electrophysiologits - BrS case thoughts?Placed in cardiology recently and saw a patient / situation that I found interesting, details have been changed for confidentiality.

Young male diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome in their early teens presented to clinic for an assessment after referral. After exhausting other medications the referrer has requested a review to determine whether it would be safe to start him on another medication (stimulant class, but is not on the list of drugs to ~~preferably~~ avoid for BrS) - the patient seemed more concerned with it disrupting his ability to apply to his desired career. Patient reported no history of palpitations or light headedness since adolescence, and had never reported nor been admitted for any syncopal event. HR in 80s and normotensive, cardiovascular exam insignificant but basal ECG did have RBBB.

I looked at his notes during &amp; after the consultation and noted that they had previously undergone surgery to implant a loop recorder which was in for \~1 year post-diagnosis. Loop recorder documented no significant/relevant arrhythmia, even during self-reported event times and when the patient presented to ED with light headedness. In summary: they had no documented arrhythmia, no FH of SUDS, family was tested and had no Brugada-like ECG pattern, no episodes of syncope, no genetic testing had been done and they had never undergone ventricular arrhythmia provocation studies. The only diagnostic criteria they met was the appearance of Type 1 ST segment elevation on Ajmaline challenge (no occurrence of VT, QRS prolongation or PVCs). 

What would be your move here? I found it interesting that we wouldn't offer this gentleman an ICD due to him being 'low risk' and/or asymptomatic, but the consultant maintained that it was necessary to keep the diagnosis despite not meeting the criteria, and refused to approve the medication. I've unfortunately been unable to discuss the case further with the Dr as I’ve rotated and it’s summer now, but considering BrS is fairly novel and current testing methods have poor sensitivity/specificity I’d be interested in hearing your thoughts.",medicine,t3_cnlr2v

"Cardiologists/EM docs/all others of meddit, curious regarding your opinions on a caseTo give you the setting, a few weeks ago I’m working in a rural ER I work at occasionally. 2 hours from nearest hospital. It is pretty well stocked, although only with common medications used in an ER. It’s actually quite busy and have about 12 active patients, 5 of them are in the process of getting transferred, 3 of them to an ICU. Just as I am starting to relax, two new patients check in within a minute of one another. I get called to triage about one of them who is a gentleman that is diaphoretic, hypotensive, jaundiced, and his testicles are swollen (he is not who this case is about). I have him rushed back so we can resuscitate him immediately as it becomes obvious this guy has Fournier’s Gangrene and needs to get transferred out now. Meanwhile the second patient to check in gets sent to a room in the back and is being handled by a new nurse as the others are helping resuscitate the other gentleman who is actively trying to die. I get handed an ECG, rate of 148 which is the same rate of my Fournier’s guy, so I just briefly glance at it while I’m putting in orders and assumed that ECG was for him. Probably about 25 minutes after both those patients check in, I go to check on the second guy however, he is in XR (I had put in some cursory orders as I knew I would be held up with the first guy). I get a few calls from surgeons and intesivists and hospitalists about coordinating care for my guy with Fournier’s so it is another 20 minutes before I go back to check on the second patient.

When I walk in I find a 50-something year old gentleman who is diaphoretic, severely tachypneic, and tripoding. His HR is 150, he is sating 87% on 6L NC, BP is 170/110. He is afebrile. Has diffuse crackles on lung auscultation. He apparently has no medical history. He had been having SOB for a few days and it significantly worsened that evening. I quickly put him on bipap, give him a couple SL nitros and go find his ECG and realize that ECG with a rate of 148 is his. It’s regular, axis normal, intervals are normal, no evidence of ischemia, but p-waves are upright in aVR and V1, and inverted in all other leads. My first thought is obviously 2:1 flutter with buried p-waves in the QRS complex. I am now questioning whether to rate control someone that is in new onset heart failure as the classic teaching is to avoid BB in acute heart failure exacerbations (not quite sure on the evidence behind this), however, it is also recommended to avoid CCB in patients with systolic heart failure. I use our very outdated bedside US to find the patient has an EF of likely somewhere around 15-20%. 

So I find myself in a predicament. It is possible that the patient’s HF is due to their tachydysrhythmia vs causing it. Also, is this patient in and out of flutter/fib? His symptoms have been going on for greater than 5 days. What would you do? I thought the best answer would be synchronized cardioversion, however, the patient and wife adamantly refused it further complicating issues. The only med I had for chemical cardioversion was amiodarone, which I don’t typically use due to the cardiologists and intensvists at the receiving hospital where I also work not typically liking amio. So I am back to BB vs CCB vs do nothing and hope for the best. I end up giving a half dose of diltiazem which brings his rate down to 125. I get a repeat ECG that shows that what I thought was a-flutter was actually a unifocal atrial tachycardia. The patient now looks much better, although probably more due to the bipap. I call the cardiologist at the facility accepting him and they recommend holding off on additional meds and they’ll figure it out when he arrives. The patient then ends up converting to NSR as he is about to be transferred a few hours later.

So how would y’all handle this case? I thought it would be interesting to hear varying opinions.

"Why isn’t there a “hotel” for patients?Fourth year med student who barely knows anything about the business side of medicine. However, I have seen many times by now how placement issues can keep patients in house for weeks or even months past the time they need inpatient medical care. 

My question (especially people on the finance admin stuff in medicine) is... why isn’t any arbitrage going on?

I’m pretty sure that after X amount of time the hospital isn’t getting paid anything by the government for for these patients, but are definitely still paying for 24/7 nursing and getting rounded on. 

If a SNF or inpatient rehab or whatever won’t accept the patient, why doesn't the hospital pay to put them up in a temporary SNF or a literal hotel depending on their needs in the meantime? Even if the patients’ insurance doesn't pay squat for it it would still be cheaper, no? Seems like it would be more pleasant for the patient, too.

I’m guessing there’s some legal rational or the hospital is getting compensated more than I’m assuming. In California, for context.",medicine,t3_cn7w54
"DOCTORS: I'd like to pay it forwardMe and wife just had a recent experience with a doctor who we consider saved her life. She was feeling terrible pains in her abdomen so we went to see a public doctor, where they told her she had an inflamed intestine; take this shot and take better care is what was prescribed. Prior to seeing the doctor we were the ‘google detectives’ who thought we could find a diagnosis over the internet. We were worried she might have gallstones (even though the pain was on the wrong side), and that she might need to be operated. We asked the public doctor if it could be gallstones and she said no, it wasn’t that. So we left the office pretty relieved. However, 1 day later her pains didn’t get any better and we started to doubt the doctors diagnosis. A friend recommended a doctor by name, but had lost their phone number. Like the detectives we were, we went to the internet to try and find their contact information, and we did, sort of. We found their website through a directory (with out of date contact information listed), and their phone number wasn’t listed on the website, so we wrote them an email and reached out on facebook. We waited 24 hours but never got a response, so we decided to go with a different doctor and got an appointment the same day. Immediately was told that she needed an ultrasound and was quickly confirmed to have gallstones. Dang… They told us if we waited any longer that it could have caused an infection and serious complications or death, and that she needed an operation to remove the stones. Great… Just what she wanted to hear.. Not. Anyway, we checked her into the public hospital with an emergency status from the doctor, and the surgery was done 2 days later. Recovery was pretty rough, but successful. Thankfully we had the intuition to get a second opinion, and not wait for the second doctor to reply. A couple days into recovery we actually got an email reply from the ‘other’ doctor saying they could schedule an appointment, and to call their office because email replies can be slow (you don’t say).

This experience made me realize just how important it is to keep a website up to date, with contact information at your fingertips. I feel like I could have lost my wife if we had relied on the ‘other’ doctor to reply. If their phone number was listed, we could have called and seen a doctor sooner. So that’s why I came to this community; I do web/graphic design for a living and want to pay it forward. I want to offer a free website evaluation if you’re a doctor and have a website. I’ll take a look at your website with my check list and give you feedback on what is missing, or what can be improved, you can do with that information as you please! Maybe it can help a different family in the future.

"Proper use of cangrelor drip for (high-risk) ACSWhat are your opinions on cangrelor drip for pts that you're admitting for acute coronary syndrome that you feel will have a moderate-to-high probability for meeting indications for CABG? For ACS, I'm mostly referring to NSTEMI (since that's the vast majority if what I see as an IM resident) but feel free to generalize. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've only been in a small handful of situations when I've had pts with significant cardiac disease presenting with NSTEMI that I've loaded (usually with Plavix), and during the cath they had some combination of disease that led to a CT surgery consult for CABG which ended up being delayed a few days due to the P2Y12 load. Fortunately no harm was done for the pts I've loaded, and we used the few extra days to optimize the pt further prior to surgery (if needed). Although I've had many coresidents yelled at by cardiologists or CT surgeons for doing this. 

&amp;nbsp;

The option of using a cangrelor drip has been brought up many times. A fast-onset P2Y12 inhibitor that can be turned off ~30 mins prior to surgery, so it seems ideal. I've never been in a situation where I needed to order it, and have only had 2 pts that were already on it before I took over.

"Clinic only allows pages to my phoneThe hospital where I'm doing my residency has recently implemented a new paging system for clinics: through an app on my phone.

The old way it worked: If a patient had to talk to a physician from our clinic after hours, they would call the call center and be told that a physician would call them back shortly. In the meantime, we would get a page on our pager with the patient's contact info so we could call them back.

The new way it works: The pager is done away with. We now have to download an app on our phone that receives all our after hours clinic pages. We do not have the choice to use a pager.

I see multiple problems with this:

1. I like to leave my phone on ""Do not disturb"" when I'm sleeping so I'm not woken up by unimportant notifications. Now I can't use ""Do not disturb"" because I need to hear the ring tone when my phone gets a page.
2. I may not hear my phone's ringtone when I'm asleep.
3. What if I crack my phone's screen? My phone isn't as durable as a pager. I'll have to repair it, and while it's getting repaired, how will I get pages?
4. I don't want my employer telling me what I can and can't install on my phone. This isn't their phone to dictate that stuff.
5. What if I'm in an area where my phone doesn't get reception? I won't know that I got a page.
6. What if my phone runs out of battery during the day and I'm nowhere near a charger? At least with a pager, I can see when my battery is getting low and have a couple days to rustle up some batteries.

Would anyone else have a problem with this?",medicine,t3_ckun9u

"Medical ethics- direct patient care/contact while under the influence of benzodiazepinesI want to first start off my apologising if this is not allowed. I am aware of the medical ethic group, but it does not seem too active and I need an answer soon, as I face this issue daily.

I work in a doctor's and one of the medical assistant takes xanax like it is candy, she has proven to be addicted to it and non functioning (even more so than now) without it. It's my personal opinion that her use of the medication has directly resulted in the lack of patient care. She has become forgetful of simple task and has proven she can't keep up with the work required. She has given wrong medication injection and vaccinations, due to forgetfulness. She has been extremely rude to staff, management, even patients. Her inability to meet the minimum expectations for her provider was made it so everyone else has to pick up her slack, so her patients get what they need. Each provider in mu practice has their own MA, so when she doesn't do her stuff, it falls to the others. In my opinion this causes the other providers patients to get the level care they should, because the MA's are spread thin trying to cover the one in question. The issue has been reported to my office manager, by our assistant office manager, but the manager does not see the effect.  I'm tired of patient care being effected, because she wants to pop xanax. I believe when at work, patient care about ALL else. Patients first, afterall that why we go into clinical healthcare.

If it is ethically wrong, should I report it to our partners company (I work for a hospital in a primary care office)?",medicine,t3_cjzipz

"American Family Physician Endorses AcupunctureI wish acupuncture had better data to support it beyond that which you'd expect for a placebo but it doesn't so AAFP shouldn't be promoting it unless they also want to argue that placebos are now ethical.

[Science Based Medicine article on AAFP and acupuncture](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/american-family-physician-endorses-acupuncture/)

""The AFP is wrong. Acupuncture is a theatrical placebo. It is *not*  supported by good evidence. Any apparent improvements are subjective  rather than objective; they are small in magnitude and not clinically  significant. Acupuncture is *not* entirely safe; it can cause  serious complications and even deaths. Placebos, by definition, may  “please” the patient, but it is unethical to prescribe them. And a  placebo treatment that has no objective benefits and risks killing  patients or putting them in the hospital has a particularly unacceptable  risk/benefit ratio.

"Trying to make sense of a code we had today.I'm a scribe in an ED and today I saw the weirdest code. There was a lot of speculation about the possible causes behind the patient's presentation but since we're not going to get any answers, I figured I'd write about it here to see if anyone has any ideas or can help me make sense of it. I've changed the details of this case to protect anonymity.

A patient in his 40s with zero PMHx presented via EMS after a syncopal episode preceded by multiple episodes of vomiting at breakfast. Pt's mom states they'd just finished eating and he just doubled over, vomited for about 20 minutes, then passed out. When EMS got there he was A/Ox3, 12-lead showed sinus tach, O2 sat in the 80s. He presented super diaphoretic and about 2 minutes after arrival he syncopized again. EKG at this time showed sinus tach. Breath sounds were clear. Blood glucose 122.

At this point they became hypoxic, O2 sat 70s, and would go in and out of apnea even with vigorous sternal rubbing. When he would wake for brief periods of time he was very agitated, trying to remove his NRB and get out of bed. This lasted for about 5 minutes before the final LOC at which time he stopped breathing, was cyanotic, and HR dropped into the 30s. Then pulse check: none. Pupils were found to be dilated to 8 mm but equal and reactive. No hx of benzo/stimulant use. Pt was moved to a bigger room, bagged, compressions started.

8 rounds of epi, 2 rounds of bicarb, 4000 of heparin, and an epi drip later, the patient had ROSC 6 times only to lose it a minute later. At one point the monitor looked STEMI-ish so another EKG was done showing ST elevations in V3 and V4, but depressions in I, aVL, V5, and V6. He was coded for about 45 minutes total.

Talking to family, it seems they have a strong history of sudden cardiac arrest at a young age. But what's up with the EKG findings and the dilated pupils?

OUr daytime attendings are mean to interns and expect too much out of us; we need to learn how to do orders and present and how to do things like read EKGs and except patients before we can actually present like second years and it makes rounding take too long.  THis impacts patient safety issues. 

A nattending is trying to make senior years violate ACGMEregulations by doing admissions for interns and saying we did them at rounds if admitted overnite.  They make the senior write the admit order and things for serious things we need to know how to do to save lives. We have no way of learning.

People get singled out to give answers during rounds and it is unfair and creates an oppressive place to learn.

**** Medical Company uses residents to make extra money.  They bill intern notes as resident notes and it is fraud,.

Specialists are abbusive and this is harassment and abusive behavior.  They do not want interns calling which is not fair and we cannot learn.

### BACKGROUND:

There are increasing concerns about risks associated with aspirin discontinuation in the absence of major surgery or bleeding. We investigated whether long-term low-dose aspirin discontinuation and treatment gaps increase the risk of cardiovascular events.

#### METHODS:

We performed a cohort study of 601 527 users of low-dose aspirin for **primary or secondary prevention** in the Swedish prescription register between 2005 and 2009 who were &gt;40 years of age, were free from previous cancer, and had ≥80% adherence during the first observed year of treatment. Cardiovascular events were identified with the Swedish inpatient and cause-of-death registers. The first 3 months after a major bleeding or surgical procedure were excluded from the time at risk.

#### RESULTS:

During a median of 3.0 years of follow-up, 62 690 cardiovascular events occurred. **Patients who discontinued aspirin had a higher rate of cardiovascular events than those who continued (multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.34-1.41), corresponding to an additional cardiovascular event observed per year in 1 of every 74 patients who discontinue aspirin.** The risk increased shortly after discontinuation and did not appear to diminish over time.

#### CONCLUSIONS:

In long-term users, discontinuation of low-dose aspirin in the absence of major surgery or bleeding was associated with a &gt;30% increased risk of cardiovascular events. Adherence to low-dose aspirin treatment in the absence of major surgery or bleeding is likely an important treatment goal.",medicine,t3_cgt3ue

"Why does the central venous pressure (CVP) rise when having a pulmonary embolism?Hi all, I am a medical student preparing for my exam in heart/lung physiology.

Medicine is increasingly difficult, after having been near-impossible to begin with. I see the sacrifices many of you have made as I interact with you in my work. I see who is tired, sad, checked out, peppy, stressed, overwhelmed, quirky, contemplative, and exhausted. 

Im not under an illusion that *everyone* in this profession is a saint...but *many--the vast, vast majority* of you are  are out there doing the best you can every day, and thats a lot to ask for, and a whole lot to give.

This community is full of incredibly bright, incredibly compassionate, incredibly dedicated individuals. Thanks for giving a damn, everyone. Please take care of yourselves, your loved ones, and your colleagues.

"How do you deal with the dreadful knowledge of having made mistakes?I’m now through the 6 first months of EM residency. I feel like I’ve become a good doctor, and that I can finally contribute and make my own decisions. At the same time I’m increasingly weighed down by a small handfull of incidents where I either made the wrong decisions, was forgetful due to being busy, or could have simply just done better. It has started to increasingly affect the way I work (I slow down the department due to double or tripple-checking everything, calling in maybe not so necessary consults, or ordering extra unnecessary tests- juust to make sure) - I feel like I’m becoming way to defensive in my approach to medicine in order to avoid mistakes, which sometimes just slows down or completely paralyzes progress of certain patients. It has also started to affect me personally - when I’m off work and should just enjoy being with my family, I spend an increasing amount of time worrying about whether this patient is going to be OK, or whether that incident will end up in a complaint, or eventually end up affecting my residency or ultimately my license. I need a healthy and good way to deal with this, otherwise I feel like I’m not going to last long in this career, even though I love it and feel like I’m good at it! Any help is appreciated!

"Scanzano Jonico (ITA) refuses to upgrade to 5G tecnology due to ""health concerns""I'm gonna translate in English the [original](https://www.dday.it/redazione/31650/scanzano-jonico-divieto-reti-5g) article, written in Italian. I'm not an English mother tongue speaker, so if I made some mistakes it'd be great if you could pinpoint that to me, so I can learn from my errors!

&amp;#x200B;

Scanzano Jonico is going to be the first city without 5G technology. Following the Major's decision, no infrastructures shall be installed and no test on 5G shall be authorized.

The decision has been taken on the basis of a number of documents, for example, the EU resolutions that in 2009 and 2011 certified ""electromagnetic field sensitivity"" as a handicap. The ordinance goes on quoting the studies by **Rea 1991, Havas 2006 e 2010, McCarty 2001,** on the possibility to diagnose this condition in some individuals. Last but not least, quoting the TAR of Lazio sentence (n.d.r.: Regional Court of Administration) that asks for ""information campaigns aimed to reduce risks for health and environment linked to improper use of electronic/telephonic devices"".  


""This being said wants to pinpoint the fact that 2/3/4G connections were unsafe, but 5G will be even unsafer for human health if compared to previous G standards (according to the Major's statement and ordinance).

   
A short extract of the ordinance (ndr: original photo following the link above, I can translate all the document for the interested ones)

&gt;*5G uses microwaves at higher radiofrequencies thant previous connection standards, aka as ""millimetric waveleghts"", that imply two main things:*  
*1: higher amount of transmitted energy to radiofrequency receivers (such as human skin, bone, tissues in general;*  
*2: less penetration of the radiowaves throught walls and solid barriers in general, thus leading to a necessity of installing multiple beacon repeaters for 5G in order to cover all the area.*  


Millimetric wavelengths seem to be the source of the fear of 5G as a serious health concern. Many groups born on the Net state that the tests run by some companies (Vodafone, Wind-3...) are not legitimate. Scanzano Jonico adopted the same idea, thus replying to this ""menace"" with the previously quoted ordinance.  
It'll be now necessary to understand whether other municipalities will follow the same path or if the public interest in 5G will prevail. 

On the other hand, as stated in the ordinance, 

&gt;""*5G radio frequencies are widely unexplored, with a complete lack of preliminary study about health and environmental damage that could derive*""

The irony of this fact is similar to the question ""which came first, the egg or the chicken"": how do we get to now that 5G is dangerous if we do not allow its experimentation?",medicine,t3_cgfb28

"What’s the rules in general for trying to date another physicianI am a big fan of doc marriages. I love what I do and love being able to share those stories with an understanding audience. I also find intelligence to be highly attractive. While it’s not a firm requirement, I would love to date another physician. 

I am starting as an attending in a teaching hospital / med school. My previous relationships with other docs were results of online dating as I had a personal policy of not wanting to connect with people in the same hospital.

Now I am in a smaller town, just wondering how does meddit handle this type of situation? Now that I am a teaching faculty, I definitely do not want to make any sort of romantic move on anyone that I am directly in charge of. But what about other young attendings? What about residents from other services? What’s in general, the sensible rule for this? 

For example, you see an attractive resident/attending from a different department (or another attending from your own department), how would you go about to ask them out?

"[Clinical] 26w GA Pregnant woman with fasting glucose of 277: Overt or GDM?Confused MS here. Attending said ***overt***; 

I tried to find any text that confirms this, but [UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetes-mellitus-in-pregnancy-screening-and-diagnosis?source=history_widget#H3897142904) says that:

&gt;If a patient in early pregnancy (before significant insulin resistance) meets standard ADA criteria for diabetes, she is assumed to have had the disorder prior to the pregnancy, but **there is no way to determine at what gestational age this would no longer be true.** (See [""Clinical presentation and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults""](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults?topicRef=6797&amp;source=see_link).)

A fellow ObGyn resident told me that I could differentiate overt DM from GDM using ADA's criteria, i.e., at any point during pregnancy, fasting glucose &gt;126 diagnoses overt DM.

"Is it egregiously wrong to use a nu-swab on a pediatric patient?I have recently left an employer regarding this situation, and wanted a unbiased opinion on the topic:

I work(ed) in a pediatric unit, where a 5 year old patient presented with excessive vaginal discharge. My initial impression of the situation was that abuse was unlikely, but I wanted to provide a comprehensive workup, and decided to take an nuswab of the patient's discharge at the vaginal opening to rule out bacterial vaginosis, as well as screen for any potentially more malignant sources of discharge, such as GC/CT (even if I did not specifically suspect these things). My clinical administrator found this to be egregiously wrong, stating that it is a traumatizing experience for a child to go through, and that urine would be as powerful of a screening tool as a culture of the discharge itself. I questioned that if the procedure was traumatizing (This is not an endocervical sample, no speculum was used and the patient had no visible reaction to the swab being taken at the vaginal opening), and also questioned the clinical value of urine, with the belief that a urine culture is a less sensitive workup than a nu-swab would provide.

Since we have decided to part ways after this decision, my standard resources are unavailable to me, and I wanted to talk to meddit on this topic to insure my own clinical care is appropriate in the future. What do you think? Did I cross a line by using this tool? If I was to use urine, would a urine culture have the adaquete sensitivity to screen for pathogenic organisms?

"The Bactericidal vs Bacteriostatic mythSo recently I was lectured by an internist regarding an antibiotic choice due to the antibiotic's bacteriostatic properties (clinda). He preferred an antibiotic that is bactericidal (vancomycin) along with Zosyn. We will ignore the fact that this was a patient stung by a wasp the day before, with a fairly large local inflammatory response to his arm that I've seen frequently in the ED. The patient was afebrile, normal VS, the was no induration, no tenderness, and this internist was requesting we admit him to monitor for possible necrotizing infection (eyeroll), but sure as long as you are the one doing the admitting.

I tried to explain to him that bactericidal and bacteriostatic are laboratory definitions and are clinically meaningless, but he was adamant regarding his antibiotic choices. I eventually relented, as he would be the one caring for the patient while he is admitted, but did advise that he read [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5905615/) article from *Clinical Infectious Diseases* regarding the myth of *-cidal vs -static* antibiotics. Its a systemic literature review which demonstrates 56 RCTs comparing -cidal vs -static antibiotics, of which 49 showed no significant difference, 6 which demonstrated superiority of the -static agent surprisingly, and only a single RCT that demonstrated superiority of the -cidal agent (although the -static antibiotic was underdosed). 

To be fair, I was taught this in medical school as well, and even in residency I had an intensivist try to explain this to me, although I had never actually seen any convincing literature on the subject. I posted this story and article primarily to address dogma that appears to still be present today, and the importance of doing literature reviews on widely held knowledge, as much of what we were taught in medical school and residency have very little evidence base.

A brief assessment of major body systems (cognitive, cardiac, pulmonary, GI, GU, skin/wounds, mobility)

Any PRNs given and if they were effective or not

Any acute issues/events and how they were addressed 

So a note on, for example, a post-op CABG might read like this:

Pt is alert and oriented. Sternal pain well controlled with oxycodone given twice. He had one brief episode of A fib but converted back to sinus rhythm after 15 minutes. BP has been stable. Oxygen weaned from 4 to 2 liters and he states SOB is improving. Voiding adequate clear yellow urine. No BM since surgery, PRN miralax given. Sternal incision and chest tube sites are well approximated with scant  serosanguinous drainage. He is ambulating 360 feet independently with no symptoms.

A note on a CHF exacerbation might read:

Pt was alert and oriented at start of shift with new onset confusion around 2200, along with increased dyspnea. MD notified and order obtained for CXR, 80mg lasix, and ABG. ABG showed hypoxia and Pt started on bipap. Dyspnea and mental status improved with diuresing and bipap. She remains in sinus rhythm/sinus tach, HR 90-110. Foley remains with large amount of output. She had one BM this shift, no GI symptoms. No skin breakdown noted. She requires two person assist for bed mobility and transfer to bedside commode.",medicine,t3_cc2ny9

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen (and contributed to) a few posts recently about the differences between the US and UK healthcare systems, and while I've heard most of the regular arguments, one that really got me thinking was the thread about the [racist, non-emergency patient being ejected from a Wigan (UK) hospital without treatment](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/cb9984/wigan_hospital_boss_slams_patient_who_demanded/). Someone commented on there that this wouldn't happen in their (US) hospital as the hospital would be worried about getting a bad rep, because at the end of the day it's a business. I hadn't even thought about this particular issue being an advantage of working in a public healthcare system; I'd just taken it for granted that I (female doctor) can refuse to treat someone on the basis of sexist abuse, and that my friends who suffer racist abuse can do similarly.

&amp;#x200B;

So.. are you happy with the type of healthcare system you work in? What, if anything, would you like to change? If you're unhappy with your own, whose system would you like your country to model its own healthcare system on?

"Universal HIV and HCV testing in the emergency department.Are there any FOCUS partners here? 

To keep it short and simple, FOCUS is a program that implements routine and universal HIV and HCV testing into the existing ED work flow. Many places automate the process using their EMR. (Were in Indiana. The other hospital that has started this program has roughly a 15% positive rate on the HCV screenings) 

My ED is currently trying to implement and I’m running into some barriers. I would love to discuss with other people that do this. Send me a message to further chat! 

We use cerner and our CHIO is against building a new algorithm. Trying to figure out how to make it work without doing this. 2 big barriers are 1) there is no way to stop ED frequent flyers from being tested every time without manually checking their chart for a recent test. Manually checking is obviously not feasible and a waste of time. 
2) without some kind of best practice alert or reminder in the EMR we would be relying on employees to remember to do everything. That’s too much room for human error. 

With routine screening in the ED, what has worked for you and what hasn’t? 

I tried to keep it brief so I’m sure there’s some info missing. Please ask questions to clarify!",medicine,t3_cbhsvi

"An alternative to t-PA in ischemic stroke? The IGOR SHOT ME study.**IGOR SHOT ME** - Investigating Global Outcomes after Radically inducing Stroke HemOrrhagic Transformation using a Magnum  .44 Extracranially


**Objectives** - 
To investigate alternative treatment options for patients presenting with ischemic stroke


**Design** - 
Randomized placebo controlled trial. In the treatment group, a study assistant (Igor) will induce a hemorrhagic stroke transformation using a Magnum revolver.  As the revolver will only be loaded in some cases, this will lead to a probability driven firing. With higher NIH-Stroke Scale-Scores the probability will rise. We expect the probability to be about 1 : 20, corresponding to 3-5% hemorrhagic transformation.


**Participants** - 
Patients suffering from ischemic stroke (onset 0 - 9 hours) 


**Main outcome measure** - 
Our primary endpoint is the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 

Our secondary outcomes are ischemic stroke volume using MRI machines and a composite outcome of patient satisfaction, administrative costs and mortality.


**Statistical analysis** - 
For statistical analysis we will be will be using a test that yields a p&lt;0.05 for our primary endpoint (e.g. poisson regression analysis)

We will not do any interim analysis and do not expect any mortality difference between the two groups. however, if we notice a trend towards an increase in mortality, a loss of equipoise will manifest itself and we will have to stop the study prematurely. 


**Expected outcomes** - 
Due to the higher probability in treatment application in patients with higher NIH-Scores we expect a drop of the mRS from 3 in the placebo group to 2 in the treatment group.",medicine,t3_cac0o5

"Anyone ever go to patient’s funerals? Wanting to know if it’s acceptableI work in a NICU at a fairly large hospital and I had a premature baby come in at 23 weeks. And that baby stayed with us for 6 or 7 months and in that time I took him almost exclusively on the weekends. So I got very close to the family and the baby in that time. They were so nice. If I had time I would always stop and chat in between doing things. They played jokes on me, we laughed, we talked for hours, we would help them get him up to hold. God I loved that family and that baby and I really think they loved having me there. 

He was always a little bit of an under dog. He had a lot of health issues and his lungs were a big one. We tried alot of things with him. Some things worked and some didn’t. He ended up getting a trach and  at our hospital they usually will go to the PICU once they get one and that’s what happened. So he went down and I haven’t seen him or his family for probably a month or two. But he passed away this week in a kind of a freak way that I won’t elaborate on but it wasn’t expected. 

I’m having a hard time processing his passing as I really thought he was going to make it out. By the time he got his trach he would smile and play and started doing baby things and it was amazing seeing his progress. I’m deeply saddened by his passing and I’m not going to lie and say I haven’t cried. 

So what this post is really about is have any of you been to a patient’s funeral/viewing? I have talked to a few of the nurses and I get very mixed responses. Some say if you have that kind of connection with them then you should go and other say it’s best to let to go. I think it may help me but maybe it’s irrational but I have this fear that seeing me is going to make them relive their NICU experience. Am I being irrational?",medicine,t3_c9j09s
"Varicella Zoster (Chickenpox) serum IgG levelsHi all, I'm currently an M1 reading medicine (MBBS) in Singapore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to ask about the significance of serum IgG levels for the varicella zoster virus (VSV). In Singapore, children commonly just receive one VSV vaccination in early childhood (2 y/o). I'm assuming the threshold for serum IgG levels to qualify as seroconversion would be 100 mU/mL.

1. What is the expected range of post-vaccination serum IgG across the general population 12 months after vaccination, and how will the IgG levels fluctuate over time? 
2. Would it be valid to assume that at serum IgG levels greater than 100 mU/mL, higher IgG levels indicate stronger immunity? Is there a point beyond which an increase in IgG does not lead to a proportionate increase in immunity?

Meanwhile in Sweden I've heard of doctors losing their license for doing hormone replacement therapy in older patients and even getting a slap on the wrist for promoting Vitamin D supplementation.

Also in Germany every procedure tends to be based on a ""list price"" and doctors don't make a third of what they do in the US, albeit typically with a lot better work life balance and less lawsuits.

"GARDASIL-9 in patients having received GARDASILI'd like to hear your perspectives about pretty controversial topic that has yet to be studied extensively.

The CDC claims that this should not be the case but I can't find the studies that they have based this statement on. Regardless, I feel like there can be lots of benefits if it is done, particularly if a patient isn't sexually active yet or has multiple sexual partners, (i.e. is not monogamous) or is immunocompromised.

I feel like there isn't information out there for those who are interested in getting extra coverage with GARDASIL-9, particularly in regards to how many extra doses should be given (should there be 2 or 3 doses?).

"A great interview with a Stanford med professor - ""Her Famous Student Didn’t Listen — and Is Paying a Big Price""A fascinating interview with Phyllis I. Gardner, a Professor of Medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Teaching moral values is the most important thing indeed.

""Before Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford University to start the blood-testing company Theranos, she asked one of her professors for advice. That professor, Phyllis I. Gardner, told her that the science wasn’t there, that it wouldn’t work. Holmes didn’t listen, and the rest is history — headlines, really. In 2018, Holmes settled civil fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. And this month a federal court will hear from Holmes and her former business partner, who [have been charged](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/health/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-fraud.html?searchResultPosition=1) with deceiving investors, patients, and doctors. Holmes has denied wrongdoing.

Gardner said it wasn’t going to work. Lots of people didn’t believe her. Now, one blockbuster *Wall Street Journal*[investigation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901) and a book, documentary, podcast, and federal lawsuit later, Gardner, a professor in the School of Medicine, was proved right.

As Holmes’s story unfolds, and onlookers, including universities, try to glean lessons from the bad blood, Gardner said they should emphasize to students the importance of developing values rather than chasing a billion-dollar idea. She spoke with *The Chronicle* about her role as an adviser and why it’s not enough for students to pay lip service to empathy, honesty, and the other virtues they should have learned along the way — they have to live them. ""

My question is does anyone have a source that D5 is neutral or even harmful in otherwise in non-hypoglycemic hospitalized patients? Ive heard in passing that it is indeed harmful. I’ve tried searching but there is too much noise out there.

Edit: she specifically asked me to send her an article that supports the notion that IV dextrose isn’t necessary in a fasting state. Maybe I’ll ask r/ketoscience",medicine,t3_c68nuw
"Are you seeing an increase in worried well and are they contributing to burnout?This is anecdotal but it seems more and more clinic patients are worried well than say 10 years ago. They have vague or minor complaints and are very anxious about a specific disease or condition that they found on google or heard from an online community.  I spoke to my endocrinologist,  immunology and rheum colleagues and they say the same thing. In fact the immunology clinic was about 90% parents concerned their kid had an immunodeficiency when they haven't. While I treat these patient with as much compassion as I can, I do not feel that is rewarding to care for them and often is exhausting and not a good use of my time and expertise. At my institution it is difficult to screen out patients prior to the visit.  Recent example: child handles pig at petting farm, parent convinced child has trichinosis.

Some examples:

Severe thiamine deficiency as a cause for lactic acidosis (pyruvate is diverted from Krebs cycle to form lactate instead)

Warfarin - in the first few days, patients are relatively prothrombotic due to the difference in half-life of protein S/C compared to factors II, VII, IX and X. 

Trimethoprim causes a reversible hyperkalemia and elevates creatinine levels (inhibition of tubular creatinine secretion)

"AMA: We are the Asclepius Snakebite Foundation (ASF), a team of snakebite experts working to address the global snakebite crisis and provide you with the right information to manage these patients. Ask us anything!**This AMA is over. Thanks for coming by!**

Hello everyone! Snakebite season is upon us again so it seemed like a great opportunity to set up another AMA for the reddit medical community on an unusual topic that tends to generate a lot of interest.

We are the [Asclepius Snakebite Foundation (ASF)](http://www.snakebitefoundation.org), an international 501(c)3 non-profit organization led by many of the world experts in snakebite medicine that is dedicated to reducing the more than 138,000 deaths and 500,000 permanent disabilities caused by snakebite envenoming worldwide every year. We travel to the regions with the highest number of envenomations and work alongside local partners to save lives and limbs through a combination of research, treatment, and training. We have brought a few of our medical specialists here to answer any questions about snakes, snakebites, snakebite treatment, antivenoms, venoms, or whatever else comes up. We are here dispel some of the pervasive myths/misconceptions about snakebites and provide you with the right information about what to actually do for these patients, so ask us anything that interests you about the topic and we will do our best to give you a good answer.

Since we all work shifts and assume many of you do as well, this AMA will run for 36 hours or so and three of our medical experts will be available to answer questions during that time:

* Jordan Benjamin is a herpetologist, snakebite researcher, and wilderness paramedic with over 10 years of experience wrangling venomous snakes and treating snakebite patients in remote health centers and villages throughout sub-Saharan Africa. He is one of the leading experts on assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and prolonged field care of snakebites and other envenomations in remote and austere environments. Jordan is the founder of ASF and will be answering as u/snakebitefoundation
* Dr. Ben Abo is an emergency medicine &amp; EMS physician, paramedic, clinical assistant professor of emergency medicine at the University of Florida, and the medical director of the elite Venom One and Venom Two response teams of Miami-Dade Fire Rescue and Lake County Fire Rescue. These teams make up the only national-level antivenom bank in the United States. He is widely known for his [fabulous hair](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/910583), which some believe give him special powers such as the ability to [jump in front of a speeding train to pull a seizing patient off the subway tracks in NYC](https://nypost.com/2013/06/21/miami-doctor-a-lifesaver-after-pulling-man-suffering-seizure-from-village-trains-path/).  Ben is a co-founder of ASF and will be answering questions as u/venom1doc
* Dr. Nick Brandehoff is an emergency medicine physician, medical toxicologist, and assistant clinical professor of the department of emergency medicine and division of toxicology at the University of California San Francisco-Fresno program. Nick completed his tox fellowship at the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center and has extensive experience in both the laboratory  and clinical management sides of the venom world, and he leads the envenomation working group for the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology. Nick is a co-founder of ASF and will be answering questions as u/ToxDoc10

The three of us will be in Guinea next month to set up a rural snakebite clinic and launch a big study into neurotoxic snakebites by African cobras and mambas, which should be a blast! If you want to learn more about our team you can [check out the bio page on our website](https://www.snakebitefoundation.org/teamsnakebite).

Once again, we aren't selling anything and don’t have a specific agenda other than raising awareness for the snakebite crisis worldwide and educating people about snakes and snakebites. We are looking forward to talking with all of you!

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely,

Team Snakebite

"Would you respond and take action if there was a medical emergency on your flight/train/etc or just sit quietly, hope not to be noticed, and continue your travel?I was on a flight recently that had a passenger medical emergency as soon as we landed. The flight attendants called for any doctors or nurses but nobody responded right away. They called again and 3 people got up slowly and made their way to the passenger (3 rows in front of me) with looks on their faces that they clearly weren't excited about it. It just got me wondering if medical professionals would actually choose to respond or only respond if they had to or when nobody else would. 

For a little more info, when they got to the passenger they found the person had no pulse, started chest compressions, hooked up an AED after a few minutes that found a heartbeat and no shock was needed. The person woke up shortly after that and they had them breath through an oxygen mask and asked them questions. EMTs met us at the gate and took the passenger to a hospital.",medicine,t3_c47y2s

"Residency underperformance and fellowship aspirationsI’m about to start fellowship in a couple weeks. All the expected emotions are there: excitement, apprehension, curiosity, fear... except for me also there is this feeling that I need to make some personal adjustments, as well. Though I did really well in medical school (to my own surprise), I know I dogged it a little bit in residency. I didn’t read nearly as much as I could or should have (barely any dedicated reading at all other than UpToDate articles about my patients), I didn’t do any real research (only a couple fake task-working data gathering activities for other people’s projects like many of us do), and I just generally didn’t really apply myself. I know this to be true. I basically just did the work, and though I had a couple moments here and there I basically just cruised along. On my way out the door the other day, one of the junior residents made an offhand comment that I can be really great when I care about something, but pretty lazy when I don’t.  He meant it as a joke, but it resonated with me. I’d been feeling that way for a while, and somebody finally said it out loud. 

So I have plans to do better in fellowship. New city, new hospital, new people, and a renewed me. I care about this field, and I want to do right by my program, my patients, and most importantly myself. I refuse to finish fellowship (and start independent practice!) with more disappointment about missed opportunity and anemic personal growth. 

I’m wondering if anyone feels or has felt similarly, and what plans you’ve made or what experiences you’ve had in pursuit of this goal. Would love to hear some stories!",medicine,t3_c3eb8h

*[updated on 21^(st) June, 1015 HKT]*

&amp;nbsp;

Hi! I know you guys are increasingly bored of Hong Kong politics flooding your Reddit headlines, but I guarantee that **this post has nothing to do with politics.**

&amp;nbsp;

###I repeat, in compliance with sub rules, this is an apolitical, medically-oriented post.

&amp;nbsp;

Make no mistake. Again, timeline time. But some basic info:

* **Hospital Authority**: Public statutory body, overlooking gov't-funded healthcare e.g. public hospitals. This time it is almost not involved.  
  * **Dr. Leung Pak-yin**: Incumbent CEO of HA.
  * **Yan Chai Hospital** (YCH): A public hospital under Kowloon West cluster, one of 7 geographical clusters.
* **Hong Kong Adventist Hospital** (HKAH): Hospital in question. Privately-run, thus outside the supervision of HA.

  * Although owing to limited resources, we cannot offer service to patients with serious trauma (e.g. suspected [...] gunshot wounds [...] etc. ) [...] however, we will offer utmost support and treatment immediately, so as to stabilise the condition [*of patients*] before referring to a public hospital for next level of treatment.

##(1) Do private hospitals in Hong Kong turn away certain patients?

####Here is where I feel like I need legal advice.

I am not completely sure.

Lawyer Melody Chan [stated](https://hk.thenewslens.com/article/120676) on 13^(th) June that ""private hospitals may not be willing to treat gunshot wounds (私家醫院可能不肯治療槍彈傷口)."" I have yet to find verification on this statement, because it seems to be the only relevant result upon Googling.

&amp;nbsp;

##(2) What's the condition of the arrested protestors?

As of [20^(th) night](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/19/hong-kong-police-release-eight-anti-extradition-law-protesters-arrested-unrest-loitering/), 32 have ever been arrested. 5 were charged with ""rioting."" 8 were unconditionally released, their charges of ""loitering"" dropped upon insufficient evidence.

Nobody has been formally convicted of their charges.

&amp;nbsp;

##(3) When do *public* hospitals contact the police during this kind of mass incident?

####I do not recommend taking this as official guidelines.

According to Dr. Leung's conference, translated and edited from Cantonese to written Chinese by i-Cable:

* Definitely not upon discovering injuries inflicted by tear gas bombs. (在[發現]催淚彈[傷痕]的過程中，不會在這方面報案，一定不會)
* With clinical basis for rubber rounds, because they [*possibly refering to clinical presentation of wounds*] are hard to distinguish, but grey areas still exist for that requirement (但橡膠子彈有時候比較難分[…]當時要看臨牀決定如何，當然有時候是灰色地帶)

Patient: What's that?

Friend: It's where a fertilised egg ends up implanting itself somewhere outside the womb

Patient: Well it can't be that, I'm not pregnant

Friend: You're on contraception?

Patient: Yes, I'm on the pill

Friend: And you've been taking it every day?

Patient: Yes

Friend: ...

Patient: Well, except when I forget, but that's okay because Kevin takes it for me on those days!

"A national advance care directory?I saw this past Senate hearing by Atul Gawande where he suggested the following measures

""Our goal therefore must be to assure all Americans that when they face a serious illness, their care will honor their personal goals and priorities. Achieving this requires ensuring that:

Everyone 18 or older has designated a health care decision-maker (health care proxy);

Everyone 18 or older has had a conversation (and continues to have conversations) with their proxy to communicate their goals, values, and preferences for care at the end of life;

All clinicians have appropriate training to facilitate high-quality communication with patients on advance care planning and serious illness;

Everyone facing a serious illness has had a high-quality, informed goals and values conversation with their care team;

All health care providers have systems in place to elicit and document goals, values, and preferences for patients with serious illness;

All health care providers have systems in place to share patient goals, values, and preferences across care settings, to ensure they are accessible regardless of place of care.""

"Rural Africa: Removing Uvulas to Cure Diarrheawas living in a Sudanese refugee camp when stumbled across an old man who made a living performing uvulectomies on 4-8 infants every morning. The babies were generally 2-6 months old. Because the uvula looks like a worm, the refugees believed that it dripped down into the stomach and gave the newborns diarrhea. For the next three months I looked down several hundred (adult) throats and did not find a single intact uvula. This tradition is pervasive throughout rural North Africa.

I filmed [the man removing uvulas](https://youtu.be/EztSR1a_2PA) as part of a PBS series. The footage is unusual because foreigners are not allowed inside the refugee camps before 8AM and all of these surgeries happened at around 6AM while it was still cool out. 

I have found almost nothing in the literature about this procedure. I’d be very interested in your comments.

N.B: I filmed a whole series of stories on traditional medicine in Africa – including the local bleeder, burner, butcher-surgeon, etc. I would love to post some of them here – in every case there were aspects that I could not explain – but I don’t want to overstep.

"Dealing with medical mistakes? Just wrapping up my MS3 year on an IM rotation. 
Had a patient without a history of CKD admitted recently for new heart failure and AKI, now needing dialysis. I did some intense chart sleuthing and found they saw their primary care PA a couple days before admission complaining of worsening ankle and leg swelling, fatigue, shortness of breath, orthopnea, PND, cough, and lightheadedness. Drew labs at the appointment, including BNP, which was ~1,000. All this was clearly recorded in the PA’s note, but no comment on the BNP.  Patient was taken off their low dose amlodipine due to the LE swelling and started on 200mg metoprolol for their HTN. Few days pass and all symptoms significantly worse, accompanied by new oliguria, and found to have AKI due to ATN. 

This was obvious decompensated heart failure, and Step 1 couldn’t have come up with a more typical presentation. The last thing they needed was a BB. I feel terrible for this patient, and I can’t stop thinking about how all of this could have been prevented. I’m trying to get over it, but I also can’t help feeling a little angry that this patient is suffering for a careless mistake.

I know I’ll make and see many mistakes in the future, so I guess my question is how do you get over mistakes in your own and others’ management? Obviously not as a med student, but do you privately reach out to colleagues who you think may have made a mistake? Also, I know the Step 1 answer to this, but do you always tell the patients?

"[Writeup] Hong Kong doctor-lawmaker Pierre Chan in doubt of Hospital Authority's statement over patient privacy###TL;DR: Doctor-lawmaker found alleged document from the local healthcare statutory body, which requested A&amp;E doctors to record clinically irrelevant data. This later came in conflict with a press release regarding patient privacy.

&amp;nbsp;

Hi again. 2^(nd) post in a day, sorry if it seems excessive.

&amp;nbsp;

This write-up is on some piping hot controversy within medical circles in Hong Kong. I'm presenting the material in the form of a timeline. But before that, allow me to provide some background info:

* **Hospital Authority**, or HA, is a statutory body supervising all public healthcare services in Hong Kong, including 11 public hospitals.
  * The Accident &amp; Emergency Department Clinical Information System, or **AEIS**, is a computerised patient information log system used at A&amp;E departments.
  * There are police posts in public hospitals, but not private hospitals.
* The Hon. **Dr. Pierre Chan** is one of roughly 70 members of the Legislative Council (**LegCo**), belonging to the ""Medical"" functional constituency.

&amp;nbsp;

**Disclaimer**: Part of the following information is translated from the blog of Dr. Chan. You may find the relevant post [here](https://doctordaddysoccer.blogspot.com/2019/06/HA-problem.html?fbclid=IwAR1cN4f_EH59ZoSvUJx5D-TTgwD9zb8mvBIG-Ez6dqYvysUzzxLXkSura2I), in Chinese.

Alright, the main deal

##Timeline - 2019 June

* 9^(th), 1430: A demonstration against a bill amending current extradition laws
* 9^(th), 2300: Government's statement - bill would be put to LegCo on 12^(th) as usual
* 11^(th) night: Anti-amendment protestors occupy streets
* 12^(th), 0900~1000: HA enacts Mass Incident Control Centre (MICC), **[requesting](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mQCjyRdsc0/XQOE0p9OYTI/AAAAAAAAdTk/n5SSD6k6E5QNTVexO8sPXFAtbm5mQShWwCLcBGAs/s640/HA%2Bemail%2BMICC.jpg) A&amp;E doctors to record incidents related to street occupation on the AEIS as follows:**
  * `Incident nature: Mass gathering`
  * `Descripton: Mass gathering at Legco`
* 12^(th), 1500: First wave of physical conflict between protestors and police
  * Police classified clashes as ""riot""
  * Bill meeting at LegCo postponed
* 12^(th) evening: [4 men arrested](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3014356/teacher-prominent-hong-kong-school-among-four-arrested) on suspicion of ""rioting"" at a public hospital (Queen Elizabeth H.) after telling staff of their previous whereabouts
  * 3 were seeking treatment
* 13^(th), 1630: Police press conference **[confirms](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/13/just-restrained-hong-kong-police-say-150-rounds-tears-gas-20-bean-bag-shots-fired-anti-extradition-law-riot/) arrests of citizens seeking and under treatment at a public hospital**, under the justification by ""evidence and reasonable suspicion""
* 14^(th): **HA [press release](https://www.ha.org.hk/haho/ho/pad/252760e.pdf)**. Stances:
  * Patient safety: ""Patient safety during the course of patient management [...] should not be compromised by any non-clinical activities.""
  * Patient confidentiality: ""All patient information are[*sic*] collected on clinical need basis, while observing the need-to-know principles in information access""
* 14^(th) evening: Blog post by Dr. Chan doubting the HA's press release.

---
##Why is Dr. Chan bothered by HA's press release?

1. The arrests made at a public hospital were ""non-clinical activities"" which interfered with the normal procedures of patient management.

2. MICC requested A&amp;E doctors to include the protest in AEIS records of relevant patients, which is not on a ""clinical need basis"".

3. The inactivity of HA over the hospital arrests failed to respond to concerns of medical professionals and citizens over patient confidentiality, deterring citizens from seeking treatment at public hospitals and compromising patient-healthcare relations.
   * Furthermore, Dr. Chan called for a public explanation from HA, not just a press release.

---
##So, why should I care?

Well, as long as you're not working in public hospitals in HK, maybe nah. I mean, it's not meaningful to ask you about the rights of the police force in hospitals in your jurisdiction - they're probably largely the same around the world.

&amp;nbsp;

If you plan to, or are already working at one, this post might be relevant to you.

&amp;nbsp;

I have a gut feeling that many doctors ignored the request by MICC on 12/6, but there would probably be more enactments of MICC in the near future. I still cannot make sense of what the HA has in mind, and I agree with Dr. Chan that the HA owes the public and the public healthcare sector a formal explanation, lest conspiracy theories surrounding the police and HA get out of hand.",medicine,t3_c0lkso

"“Adrenaline driven rhythm” post-PEA arrest leading to re-arrestHi all.

The HR would start at around 60-70 and slowly downtrend with short episodes of deep bradycardia or asystole until re-arrest and unsuccessful resus in 20-40 minutes. 

Physiologically, what is going on here? What exactly is an “adrenaline driven rhythm” and what makes it unsustainable for more than half an hour? How can I tell if it’s adrenaline driven or not?

"Regarding the admittance of suicidal ideation in the Emergency Medicine settingHello everyone, the above is a topic that has recently grabbed my interest that has recently grabbed my attention due to recent patient encounters and I thought it would be beneficial to introduce some discussion on it to hear opinions from medical professionals of varying backgrounds and localities.

First I'll expand on the title as I can imagine it can seem a little vague. Throughout my short five year career working in emergency medicine, both in EMS and in the Emergency Department, I've noticed one patient demographic that seems particularly prone to complications. Patients who are either introduced to the system with a chief complaint of suicidal ideation or admit to suicidal ideation during triage seem to be prone to escalating emotional distress and potential violence against healthcare workers, which can significantly derail the course of their treatment and potentially create a significant negative impact on the future of the patient and the staff.

Here's an example:
1. A patient checks in to the ER with a chief complaint of abdominal pain.
2. During triage the patient admits to suicidal ideation, oftentimes after prompting from a line of questioning that is a part of triage protocol. In my experience this patient would need to be medically cleared and would either be screened by a social worker in the room or transferred to a crisis block within the emergency department.
3. Over the course of the process of being evaluated and cleared by the social worker the patient becomes emotionally distressed from being trapped in an isolated and unfamiliar environment and begins to lash out emotionally and verbally. 4. If deescalation techniques on the part of the staff are unsuccessful it could lead to aggression from the patient and subsequent chemical or physical restraint.
4. Long term, the patient could face charges for assaulting healthcare workers and receive a treatment course entirely different from what they originally needed

Unfortunately this is a progression that I've personally seen occur several times from patients who were initially upset but cooperative and eventually descend into severe emotional distress and outright aggression. There are a few potential exacerbating factors that I can guess at:
1. Locked psyche wards in Emergency Departments that, while necessary, reinforce the feeling of entrapment in patients
2. Comorbidities such as anxiety and schizophrenia that make stressful situations much more unstable
3. The similarly necessary confiscation of personal belongings that introduces a sense of urgency and dehumanization
4. The psychological stress of not being able to track time if clocks are not present in patient rooms

This is an issue that I've experienced, however my experience is limited to a few hospitals and health systems in the Midwest and Southern United States. I'm curious what opinions you might all have on:
1. How patients who admit to suicidal ideation should be handled if it isn't the chief complaint
2. Whether these patients should be allowed to leave AMA
3. What can be done to make these situations less stressful for these patients
4. What factors may lead these patients to become distressed or violent

"The Nosology of Burnout - Theory 1 - Diagnostic Ability Contrasted with Inadequacy of TreatmentOur ability to figure out what is wrong with the patient continues to outpace our ability to treat what is wrong with the patient.

We know as a profession that accurate diagnosis has intrinsic worth, but the accurate diagnosis coupled with lack of ability to do anything about it is dehumanizing. 

In mental health, we create arbitrary disease criteria so that we can always wedge a patient's symptoms into a disease diagnostic category. But then what?

The ability of the modern physician to diagnose contrasted with their inability to effectively treat is one cause of burnout. I postulate that when physicians had a diminished ability to diagnose, they were less impacted in a professional existential capacity by their lack of ability to treat patients.",medicine,t3_bycfpe
"Improving Efficiency + Patient Satisfaction (Outpatient)IM scribe, fortunately the office I currently work for appreciates my input on things outside of my job's description and wanted to know if there are any things that have made your office a better environment, for employees and patients. These are the things that I've suggested/done so far.

1) Created a WiFi for patients (not sure why they never had this)

2) Suggested getting a text messaging service for appointments, current receptionists spend way too much time on the phone just for this.

3) Encouraging patients to use MyChart to communicate with providers, the provider I scribe for doesn't check it much, but I tell the patients to message me and I'll relay the message to him, then respond.

*Questions I have*

1) Some sort of e-fax scanning system, working at an IM practice, there are tons of faxes that get sent daily that need to be scanned into the EHR, there was someone who did this, but they let him go for whatever reason and I'm not sure if they're hiring a new one, currently our boss is expecting the front desk staff to scan.

2) How do providers do their refills for meds? The current way my provider is doing it seems inefficient; all the home delivery services directly send refill requests to his secretary, then she has to confirm when the last appointment was, then send it to him. I'm not sure why they do this since he can check the last appointment easily on the same screen as the Rx Request.",medicine,t3_byh212
"Medical Record AppsGoogle's medical record repository closed some time ago and Microsoft's Health Vault is slated to close later this year. Are there any other services that allow patients to maintain their own medical records? For the unfamiliar, HealthVault would import the record as downloaded from MyChart or the equivalent. It connected with many apps and services to aggregate your medical and health information, including labs, fitness, glucometer, scales, imaging, etc. Given that it's 2019 and healthcare is keeping the fax industry alive, this seems to the a niche market that shouldn't go away.",medicine,t3_byfvy1
"AOC recently tweeted she thinks birth control should be OTCI am a future healthcare professional (starting PA school in July) and I can't help but feel she's off-base here.

Not to mention healthcare professionals can help find the method of BC that's right for that specific patient, and pregnancy prevention isn't the only indication for birth control.

"Who do I go to to report a physician for false charting?I'm a nurse who recently had a patient who was in the hospital for seven days waiting on a surgery. Every day the surgeon would come in and say ""not today, maybe tomorrow."" One morning I read the notes from the previous shift and there's a note from the surgeon that says "" I have personally seen, interviewed and examined the patient."" I ask the patient ""oh, so the surgeon saw you last night. What did he say?"" Turns out the surgeon never actually saw the patient. I believe the patient because 1) she's a very experienced nurse herself who had been waiting all day and night for the surgeon to come in. She wouldn't forget if he was there; and 2) he wrote the note at 19:15. I had been on the floor all day, and didn't leave until 19:40. If the surgeon had been in, I would have seen him.  


I mentioned it to the PA from the surgery service the next day and she confirmed that he had never been there. Who can I go to to report this without ruining my own career? We all know that surgeons carry a lot of weight in the hospital.",medicine,t3_byqv7a
"One Patient Seeking Assisted Suicide in Another State Is Pitting Everyone at My Hospital Against Each OtherA patient was admitted to my ER for an unrelated reason to their terminal diagnosis -  while packing.  In talking with them, they gave me their history, their diagnosis, and the host of problems and suffering they live with.  It came up that they were moving from my State to a State where Physician Assisted Suicide was legal specifically to be able to ""end their life on their own terms"".   

Physician Assisted Suicide in my State is not legal, and we have pretty robust legal mechanisms for involuntary commitment, psychiatric holds, and forced social worker intervention for expressed or reported suicidal ideation.  

I chose not to do anything because Physician Assisted Suicide was legal where they were going, and once they left my own State, those laws didn't apply.  Well, one of the nurses decided to call Psychiatry who then called Social Services.  A forced 72-hour psychiatric hold was handed down, along with Court-ordered mandatory ""check-ins"" to the person's home.  If you're wondering how that's possible, Social Services fills out their own petitions and gets a Judge to e-sign within hours.  

Meanwhile, a massive rift has opened up on my service between just about everyone.  Nurses confronting physicians who support assisted suicide saying ""you should be ashamed to be a doctor""; physicians who don't support it berating nurses who do saying ""that's why you're just a nurse, you have no medical ethics"".  Pharmacy is nearly on the brink of open rebellion because almost no one down there will approve (eg conscience) any orders for sedation of this person when they try to leave AMA.   

I think they are probably going to fire a Resident who said openly they would drive the patient  out of State once they were discharged.

I think this is both very surprising from a legal standpoint and very interesting in light of this sub's recent discussions on euthanasia.  I am just paraphrasing, but I think I read some comments here about how euthanasia is not practiced but high doses of opioids are given to terminally ill patients that inevitably have the effect of a slow fade.  How is this case charging a doctor with 25 counts of murder going to affect that?

"First precedent setting opioid case against a drug manufacturer is now on trial.https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/28/health/oklahoma-opioid-trial-start/index.html

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2019/05/28/oklahoma-and-johnson-johnson-face-off-in-the-first-opioid-crisis-trial.html

(I'm going to mix and match quotes from these two articles without specification for ease of reading.)

For many reasons I believe that the State of Oklahoma will lose this case.  The major reason is because the State's theory of liability is primarily based on the defendants' marketing.  

&gt;...the State needs to prove that Janssen's marketing statements were misleading, that doctors acted on that and that patients took the drug as prescribed and became addicted or died.

Had the defendants been marketing to unsophisticated consumers this would be a better theory.  Except they were not.  They were marketing to doctors.

&gt;Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter in opening statements Tuesday accused drugmakers of a ""cynical, deceitful, multimillion-dollar brainwashing campaign to establish opioid analgesics as the magic drug.""

Brainwashing doctors?  Really?  That's going to be a hard sell to the judge who is determining this case.  (No jury.)  An even harder sell with this evidence:


&gt;Ottaway (defense attorney) said that in 2009, when Janssen said opioids were rarely addictive, the Food and Drug Administration also said the drugs ""rarely caused addiction.""

Did defendants also brainwash the FDA?



The next problem is causation.

&gt;J&amp;J denies wrongdoing, arguing that its marketing efforts were proper and that the state cannot prove it caused the opioid epidemic given the role doctors, patients, pharmacists and drug dealers played.

&gt;He cited the CDC report (the chart is based on) as concluding that ""States as regulators have the responsibility and authority to monitor and correct illegal prescribers.""

If 7-Eleven illegally sells cigarettes to minors is Marlboro responsible?  The State has an interesting theory on causation.


&gt;""If you oversupply,"" he repeated over and over, ""people die.""

Should Marlboro limit their production of cigarettes to prevent minors from obtaining them?  By what percentage?  Who decides this?  


Next we have a problem with damages.

&gt;He noted the opioid deaths reflected in the state's chart did not differentiate between those taken as prescribed.

&gt;Ottoway concluded his opening Tuesday afternoon, noting that the total documented cases of addictions or death attributed to one of the Janssen medications in the case amounted to ""zero.""

That last quote really surprised me.  It should be rather obvious that you can't just slap up a chart of all opioid related deaths, illnesses and other related costs and then blindly claim the defendants are responsible for all of them.  The State should at least have attempted to parse out market share and percentage of  illegally imported or manufactured drugs.  

It is not an accident that this is the first opioid case to come to trial.  Defense attorneys carefully select which cases to settle and which to try.  This is a precedent setting case expected to heavily influence a much larger class action scheduled for trial in October.  If anyone is interested in the dispute on whether or not this is properly a nuisance law violation, the legal theory is weak but enough to get to trial.",medicine,t3_bvyldj

""I want to thank those of you who alerted us to a document recently released by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) called “CRNAs: We are the Answer.”

I was disappointed to read this malicious statement. However, there is little that’s new here. This is the same recycled, reformatted misinformation the organization has spread for years. We saw it during our campaign to preserve high-quality care in the VA. We saw it in New York last year. We have seen it this year in the seven states where the AANA and its state societies attempted to dismantle existing patient safety standards that ensured patient access to physician-led, team-based models of anesthesia. It didn’t persuade anyone at the VA or in New York or in states like Oklahoma or Arkansas. In each case, physician-delivered and physician-led care was preserved. I commend our members in those states who worked so hard for their patients.

In debate after debate, ASA has successfully responded to the misinformation the AANA foists upon state and federal policymakers. We point out that “nurse anesthesiologist” is a shameless term created to confuse patients. We explain the vast difference in education, skills and training between our medical specialty and nurse anesthetists. We present the fact that the data cited by the AANA to suggest equivalency in care is from brazen, self-funded advocacy studies paid for by the AANA itself. We give policymakers the independent studies that show superior outcomes with the involvement of anesthesiologists. And we are now highlighting that team-based anesthesia is a World Health Organization standard. The AANA and its state societies throw a lot of contempt at our medical specialty. But the good news is that with professionalism and facts, we are winning. And when we win, our patients win.

This AANA document is little more than vitriol. It is about appropriating the name of our medical specialty, disrupting successful team-based models, and ridiculous accusations of “fraud,” “overcompensation” and “barriers.” For ASA and our members, it is all about our patients and what is best for them.

The AANA document simply does not reflect reality. Throughout the country, our members continue to work successfully with nurse anesthetists in a team-based model that frequently also includes anesthesiologist assistants. We are grateful to work with all members of the care team. ASA is committed to preserving and strengthening physician-delivered and physician-led team-based models because that is what is best for our patients. We won’t be distracted from this mission, and I ask that you continue to work with me to preserve our victories and build upon them.

I also want to note that it appears this document is at the center of a larger campaign that the AANA will be unveiling soon. We will have a more detailed response to share with you here and in other member communications as events unfold.

You can read the AANA’s motivation for the document on their website.""

So far, this is a specialty-wide communication, and no ""official statement"" has been made. Of particular concern is the impending ""larger campaign"" from the AANA, and we will have to wait and see exactly what it is. If recent history is any indication, it's unlikely to be anything good.",medicine,t3_btmzjd
"Relationship with one person an MD, and other person is notThrowaway because my SO knows my reddit account. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is more of a relationship like question, however I want it directed toward people in the medical profession.  I am, but not SO is not.  My SO and I share a cultural difference (she, being Chinese) and she grew up learning about Eastern medicine, and although partially accepts western medicine, is very believing of Eastern medicine.

&amp;#x200B;

While I'm not really ""against"" Eastern medicine, I have a personality where I need ""proof"" of something working before I can able to accept it.  Examples being, research papers, or data with results.  That sorta thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the course of our relationship, many times we have discussed the Eastern way of ""always drink hot water, and never cold water.""  This is very typical Eastern way of thinking.  We're both at kinda a brick wall, and have gotten to the point of both avoiding the topic.

"Should hospitals, practitioners handle near-death experiences differently?Patients come close to death in hospitals, and sometimes they have profound psychological experiences. Some even talk about ""joy... a sense of being separated from one’s body"" and other phenomena while the event is happening. I'm not about to weigh in on the subjective experience, but the psychological effect seems to be profound, and most people who've had an NDE consider it a life-changing event.

There has been more academic interest in NDEs in recent years, and also some rampant quackery. This recent Atlantic article does an OK job at covering some of the questions from a lay perspective, and I've liked the academic work of Bruce Grayson, who looks at some of the neurological causes and effects of NDEs:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6179792/
https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/04/the-science-of-near-death-experiences/386231/

I guess my question is this. How do you treat a patient with an NDE? Should there be more sensitivity? A psych visit? 

Really love to hear about personal experiences with patients. Also from medical practitioners who've had an NDE. Most doctor's who've written about NDEs have turned it into kind of a sideshow in my opinion, about ""proof of heaven,"" etc., but I know there must be critical thinkers about it out there as well.

"How do you talk to patients who are upset about the pregnancy test you're ordering?I read a post on social media recently by a young woman who was expressing frustration that she's required to take a pregnancy test every time she visits the ER.

&amp;#x200B;

Her words:

&gt;Surprise, I’m not pregnant just like I said I wasn’t  before my care was delayed to take the pregnancy test!

&amp;#x200B;

Interestingly, the replies were flooded with women sharing similar stories and frustrations of being asked to take pregnancy tests (often when presenting to ed w/ abd pain) despite ""knowing"" for various reasons they couldn't be pregnant (menses, s/p hysterectomy, etc.). This specific complaint seemed to be compounded by many of the respondents' pre-existing frustrations with reproductive healthcare and a sense of not being believed/listened to by healthcare professionals.

&amp;#x200B;

"We should offer some sort of nursing certification built into primary care residency.I think this is warranted anyways with administrations push on off-loading grunt work to residents. Of course, this degree isn't meant to replace nurses or say that we are better nurses than them. But I think it wouldn't hurt especially if some basic requirements for certification were implemented. Maybe some extra lectures/didactics.

It would come with an abbreviation that we can put behind our name (MD/ND).

This probably wouldn't be as applicable to many specialties (with the exception of gas). But I think it would be a nice PR move as well.

"I'm a Missouri resident and medical student, and I wrote a letter to Gov. Parson regarding HB126""While portions of MO HB126 are encouraging, as a future physician I feel the need to tell you that the frank attack on the medical profession written into this bill, if not overturned, will cause an exodus of practicing and future physicians from Missouri.

""The provision: ""3. It shall be an affirmative defense for any person alleged to have violated the provisions of subsection 2 of this section that the person performed or induced an abortion because of a medical emergency. The defendant shall have the burden of persuasion that the defense is more probably true than not."" Places an impossible task on the physician who performs a medically necessary abortion, because there may be a physician, uninvolved in the case, that could be found by the state as ignorant of the details of the case or spiteful enough of his own profession who could be willing to testify against the decision made by the defendant - regardless of its validity. The state, by placing a physician performing a medically necessary abortion in the category of a felon until proven innocent, places a man or woman, whose holy and moral duty is to the good of their patient, in a legal vice – requiring them to not only make the difficult decision to end a life for the good of another, but also to determine (without legal representation in the moment) if the decision is legally provable as correct. Note the difference between medically correct and legally correct, here. A physician must, prior to performing a necessary and life saving abortion, collect and prepare a case absolving themselves of the decision - as this bill holds them guilty until proven innocent. Not only is this unconstitutional, but is also disrespectful to a profession far older and wiser than the state of Missouri, or even the United States itself.

""While I appreciate the provisions which encourage alternatives to abortions, and would like to encourage your office to continue exploring public policy in that regard, you do not have the authority to place anyone – let alone a physician in the reasonable pursuit of their holy responsibility to the safety of their patient – in the category of a felon, while also placing the burden of proof upon their shoulders.

""I will not practice medicine in Missouri if the aforementioned language is retained and passed into enforceable law, which would damage me greatly because I grew up, have family, and am being trained all within this great state. Missouri needs to protect and encourage physicians so we can continue to minister to and heal your constituents. Language such as this is inexcusable, and I believe the medical community deserves it to be overturned, and an apology.""  


I don't agree with a lot of this bill, but I wanted to focus on this terrible provision. I'm hoping Missouri practicing physicians, other medical professionals, and medical-field students will all join me in making noise about this. We all deserve a presumption of innocence. We haven't devoted our lives to healing others to be rendered a criminal in the pursuit of the good of our patients. If you are willing to help out and write a letter, you can go to this link:

"Acute mastoiditis—what’s your diagnostic pain threshold?Perhaps I was unreasonably ignorant about the topic but I only recently learned that “most” AOM patients who undergo head CT will have opacification of their mastoid cells. This somewhat blew me away and made me rethink how many patients with acute mastoiditis I may have sent home with just oral antibiotics and if that really even matters.

My issue is that many, many patients with AOM will have some level of pain behind their ear. I’ve always been taught that it must be quite significant to consider mastoiditis. 

Should I be chucking vancomycin at everyone with pain of any level? Getting a ct first? But how does the CT help other than ruling out even worse complications?

If you're interested, get in touch via [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmedicine)! We are currently scheduling AMAs up to several months in advance to suit what we know are already very busy schedules. Our AMAs run with some pre-AMA advertising, and then a 24-hour submission period for questions which are then answered at the respondent's leisure on a date and time to suit.

Recent AMAs include:

"A Case for MAiDPosted from @DavidJuurlink (https://twitter.com/davidjuurlink/status/1129811903776198659?s=21)

“I'd like to share some reflections on the death of a patient. I’ve thought about her a lot.

She gave me explicit consent to tweet the details of her case, about four hours before she died. Her hope was that someone might benefit from her experience.

/1
She came to hospital as octogenarians often do: with generalized weakness, falls, poor oral intake, fever, hypotension.

Her WBC was 17,000. Blood cultures grew E. coli.

Sepsis. Fixable enough.

/2
But she also complained of pain in her groin and thigh. It was new, progressive and debilitating.

Even moving around in her hospital bed was agonizing.

/3
A month earlier, she’d been found to have a large pseudoaneurysm arising from her external iliac artery.

(And yes, that’s a screw from a previous hip replacement traversing it.)

She underwent stenting and returned home.

/4

Because she was septic and in pain, we scanned her again. The new CT showed extensive gas within the pseudoaneurysm.

It was now infected, and that was a big problem.

/5

We continued antibiotics. She improved. We got her pain under reasonable control with hydromorphone and various other meds.

But then came the big question: “Now what?”

/6
She wanted no more surgery. Her mind was now sharp, and she was clear about that. 

But antibiotics alone weren’t going to cure the infection; they would only suppress it.

The best option, we suggested, would be antibiotics for the rest of her life.

/7
We discussed this option at length. She didn’t want it either. She explained why.
 
Pain was one reason. Meds helped a little, as long as she didn’t move around much. But our drug options were limited, and pain was going to be a persistent problem.

/8
Her even greater concern, looking forward, was quality of life.

Over the preceding months, she’d lost her mobility and independence. She wasn’t going to get them back and she knew it.

/9
She foresaw being confined to her apartment, in pain, struggling with her walker.

No more walks outside. No trips to the grocery store. No playing bridge with her friends, as she had done for years.

She wasn’t interested in living like that.

/10
We discussed palliative care: stopping antibiotics, increasing her pain meds, and keeping her comfortable while the infection took its course. Her family would keep vigil at her bedside for as long as it took.

She wasn’t interested in dying like that.

/11
She knew she was nearing the end of her life. What she wanted, she told us, was for it to end peacefully, with her mind still sharp, and her family and friends present. She wanted medical assistance in dying (MAiD).

/12
We held a family meeting. Relatives came from near and far.

They were unconditionally supportive. As it turned out, she’d discussed the prospect of MAiD, were it ever to become an option, several times in recent years.

So that became the plan.

/13
I saw her every day after that. Managed her pain. Listened to her stories. Learned about family members who’d died, and whose deaths had influenced her decision now.

Never once did she reconsider. I grew very fond of her, especially her wit and clear-eyed stoicism.

/14
After the requisite waiting period and medical assessments, the day had come.

I visited her at 7:30 that morning. She was alone but upbeat, eating Cheerios and toast from her tray.

(I still regret that this was her last meal. Wish I’d brought her a fresh bagel with lox.)

/15
A few hours later, her room was packed with family and friends. It was literally a party.

There was talking and laughing and cognac in Dixie cups. The mood was anything but funereal.

They gathered around her bed. I took a group photo. Everyone was smiling.

/16
I then watched as a colleague reviewed everything one last time, confirmed her wishes, explained what would happen, and answered everyone’s questions.

“Okay, I’m ready,” she said. Her composure was remarkable.

“Goodbye everyone. Thank you for everything. I love you all.”

/17
She received midazolam and dozed off peacefully, her children holding her hands and stroking her head.

Next came propofol, an anaesthetic.
Then rocuronium, a muscle relaxant.
Finally, potassium chloride, to stop her heart.

Five minutes after saying goodbye, she was dead.

/18
There were tears, of course. All around. But mostly the atmosphere in the room was one of serenity and gratitude, and a genuine sense of having done the right thing.

/19
I’m no MAiD expert, and I get that some people are opposed to it for various reasons. But I’ve been a doctor for 25 years, and I’ve seen enough deaths to know a good one from a bad one.

This was, without exaggeration, the best death I have ever witnessed.

/20
We all die eventually. This patient helped me realize that when my time comes, I'll be fortunate if MAiD is an option.

And I will always be thankful to her, her family, and a very skilled colleague for helping me appreciate just how good a “good death” can be.

/ end”

Like many here, I’ve seen peaceful and gruesome passings. But, having the ability and control to choose your time and place at the end of life and leave this world with grace should be a right of everyone. Also, the allergies are really bad today...

Yesterday night, while on call for more than 24 hours, I had a patient who went into hypercapnic respiratory failure. When I got to the bedside, the patient was blue, apneic, satting in the 20’s. I won’t get into the details, but I successfully averted the patient’s death and resuscitated her before the code blue team and SICU teams arrived.

I can’t explain why, but since this happened last night, I haven’t been able to sleep. I’m woken up by nightmares of what happened and keep seeing the patient in my nightmares...apneic, unresponsive, blue. I did everything right and “saved her life”—according to the SICU team—but I feel so much guilt and stress over the entire situation.

Will it get better? Have any other doctors experienced this?",medicine,t3_bq2hr5
"Reassuring patients who have poor experiences with the healthcare system?I am not a doctor, but I work in healthcare. This isn't new, but I feel like I'm seeing more and more patients lately who are 'fed up' with the system and medicine in general. 

Almost daily, I hear ""My doctor sucks / my doctor doesn't listen / my doctor says there's nothing wrong with me / my doctor doesn't know what they're talking about"". 

I know what they mean is ""I feel like my doctor doesn't have time for me / I don't feel heard / I want an explanation for my symptoms that isn't related to mental health / etc."" These are systems issues, not problems with individal physicians.

It can be challenging for me to know what to say in these situations without sounding like I'm brushing them off or simply apologizing for a poorly designed system without offering any real solutions. I do always encourage them to discuss their concerns with their physician. I know I can suggest they ask for a longer appointment. But this doesn't address the other side of the issue, where I'm not sure their GP would always appreciate me giving this advice (longer appointments) because these also tend to be more 'difficult' patients. So these folks are coming to me complaining of *xyz severe symptoms* and I go, ""I'm sorry to hear that, you should bring this up with your doctor"", patient says ""I already have, and they won't do anything about it"", and I'm left sitting there like ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

I realize I'm kind of asking about a few different things, but when consideringthe statements at the top of my post, **what would you like your patients to hear in these situations?** Or what do *you* say, if you hear it across specialties or when dealing with a new patient? Would you want to know if your patients feel this way, or do you already have a good sense of which ones would be spewing these types of complaints to others?",medicine,t3_bq60aw

"Homeopathy is a total fraud, and a cruel way to exploit people who are desperately looking for help.#Why it doesn't work

Essentially, homeopathy is based on the belief that **like cures like**. In practice, this would mean that different symptoms would be treated using small amounts of substances that in bigger doses would cause them.

I do acknowledge that this ""like cures like"" principle has been scientifically researched, with the name **hormesis**. Because of these studies, it's widely accepted that a small amount of a substance can in some cases have a different effect on a cell than a higher dose. However, we don't know how rare this phenomenon is, and the alternate effect it causes isn't necessarily positive or desired at all. 

Practicioners of homeopathy generalize this very unclear and controversial theory by thinking anything that causes a symptom can cure it in low doses. For example, in 2018, naturopath and homeopathic practicioner Anke Zimmermann gave a 4-year-old boy a remedy containing the saliva of a rabid dog, to treat the boy's supposed anger management issues (which, by the way, are perfectly natural for children that age), aggression and poor sleep, claiming that the solution ""cured"" him. If the remedy actually contained the virus, this woman was literally endangering a child's life for some crazy pseudoscientific experiment, while probably charging the parents a significant sum of money for it.

Additionally, there is another, arguably even bigger problem with homeopathy. Homeopathic medicine is produced using a method called ""potentization."" This means mixing 1 part of the desired ingredient with 9 parts of water, then shaking the solution, then mixing 1 part of the mixture with 9 parts of water again, and repeating this process over and over again. Homeopaths claim that the less of the ingredient the final solution contains, the more effective it is. This leads to the ingredients being diluted into nonexistence: in almost all homeopathic remedies, not a single molecule remains of the original ingredient. And even remedies that do have something else than water or alcohol in them only contain a couple of molecules of it: not enough to cause any effect. Again, none of this has been scientifically proven to work, but to be honest, homeopathic ""doctors"" don't seem to care about science anyway.


#Research on homeopathy

Most medical institutions around the world have rejected homeopathy as pseudoscientific nonsense, and rightfully so. In 2015, Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council, one of the world's biggest and most respected health institutions, conducted a massive study on homeopathy, with over 1800 different studies systematically analyzing papers and documents related to the topic. They concluded that there was ""no good quality evidence to support the claim that homeopathy is effective in treating health conditions.""
The NHMRC had already come to the same conclusion earlier, in 2014, when they found homeopathy to have no effect in treating any of the 68 different health conditions included in the study.
In 2010, BMJ (earlier known as the British Medical Journal) wrote an article proving that complementary medicines, such as homeopathy, are absolutely useless as substitutes for conventional medicine.
Even back in 2002, the British Pharmacological Society debunked homeopathy as completely ineffective.

BPS article 2002:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1874503/

These were only a few examples of the overwhelming majority of evidence clearly showing that homeopathy has no real curative powers. It's a fact at this point.

Most of, if not all of the ""evidence"" supporting homeopathy, however, is based on people's personal experiences. The problem with this is that these experiences originate from the subjective viewpoints of people who might be biased towards homeopathy, thinking it cured them for sure, when in reality there are tons of other possible reasons to someone recovering from a health condition. It could have been another treatment that was used alongside homeopathy that did the trick. It could have been a change of lifestyle. It could have simply been time: the human body fights for its health by itself. We all have powerful immune systems designed for keeping us alive and well.
Besides, what about all the people who didn't experience any help from homeopathy? We never see the homeopaths talk about them.

There is only one way homeopathic treatment could possibly help a human win over a disease or health condition: placebo. But it's an effect that applies to literally everything. You could eat a piece of candy, and believing in it enough, it could make you feel less ill. Funnily enough, that's basically what homeopathy is all about.


#Why it's unethical

Homeopathic doctors act like kind-hearted and helpful people, who embrace the idea of ""natural"" medicine as a way of healing for everyone. Some of them, I'm sure, truly believe their own lies. But this empathy is also a way to attract customers. Homeopathy is a big business, and a very greedy one.

These mixtures of water and alcohol are being sold to unsuspecting people as a risk-free, non-invasive cure to a plethora of different diseases/symptoms, usually as a liquid or in the form of small sugar pills. The problem with this is that even though they have no effect whatsoever, they are highly expensive, disguise themselves as real medicine and deceive people who often have chronic, painful, difficult, crippling diseases or conditions that they are desperately looking for relief for. The homeopathic industry not only lies to people and takes their money, it can even worsen public health by discouraging people from seeking help from proven, conventional medicine, guiding them towards homeopathy and other nonsensical alternative treatments instead. This is a true problem.


Lastly, I want to link you to a video about homeopathy made by a brilliant knowledge-spreading Youtube channel that some of you may have heard of: Kurzgesagt (In a nutshell). This video is what made me aware of the many flaws of homeopathy in the first place, and for that I'm endlessly thankful to the creators of it!

"Beta testing an idea for my hospital's ""innovation challenge."" All patients receive one completely FREE, annual visit to the ER for a full work up of anything that concerns them.My large, urban hospital holds frequent ""Innovation Challenges"" in which staff can pitch ideas to improve care. 

I want to create a program that allows all patients to receive 1 (maybe 2 biannually) totally free visits to the ER for assessment for any condition, and to speak to a provider about any concern. This would take place in the ER, but peripherally in maybe a fast track kind of setting, with a MD/PA/NP, RN, and clerk.

The two-part goal, abridged for brevity, is: 
1. Reduce ER overcrowding by diverting patients who frequently seek primary care in the ER, and
2. Proactively identify conditions before they become acute enough to require ER service, thereby reducing healthcare costs to the patient, and further reducing overcrowding.

Essentially the idea is to reimplement doctor housecalls, but instead the house stays put and the patient comes to it.

There are obvious barriers to this concept, but I was interested in getting some feedback on its general utility, practicality, affordability, feasibility, etc., but since so many people utilize the ER as a primary care clinic anyway, this relative ounce of prevention can actually contribute to a pound of cure.",medicine,t3_bq4hjh

"The ACGME has failed us. Disband it. Let the Government regulate GME.It's often said that medicine is one such field that has the privilege of regulating itself. We do this by empowering private ""non-profit"" corporations(ACGME, LCME, ABMS, etc) to monopolize control over deciding the way we can practice. But I'm not convinced that the government would be any worse.

After all, we're talking about an arena(Graduate Medical Education) which is funded mostly -to the tune of over 10 billion dollars annually- by the US government, in the form a massive subsidy to hospitals, to cover the costs of resident training. Why not let the government regulate it, instead of an out-of-touch, unaccountable private corporation like the ACGME? After all, it is the US taxpayer who is footing the bill. There are substantial built-in advantages to government oversight, in the form of accountability and oversight from the legislative and executive branches. Also consider that the Freedom of Information Act guarantees transparency in operations, something absent from a private org like the ACGME.

Why rely on this monopolistic private corporation, which is only minimally accountable to a slew of private stake-holders and practically accountable to none? What has the ACGME done for us? They've failed to meaningfully address resident wellness and well-being in the form of common-sense duty hour restrictions and fair pay standards. The working and pay conditions medical residents are subjected to are antithetical to federal labor law. But the hospital lobby long ago got us written off as an exemption; no over-time pay protections for us.

"Encroachment in Primary CareThis is happening in a Canadian province where I thankfully no longer practice but I worry it will become a national trend. How do we stop the creep? And since this is a multidisciplined subreddit... should we stop the creep?


Quoted from FB:

A colleague recently pointed out that NPs under the new contracts are getting paid better than the MD equivalent.


Nurse Practitioner (1.0 FTE, pay your own overhead)

Year 1: $235,000 for a minimum panel of 500 ($470 per patient)

Year 3: $245,000 for a minimum panel of 1000 ($245 per patient)


Family Physician (1.0 FTE, pay your own overhead)

Year 1: $250,000 for a minimum panel of 800 ($312.50 per patient)

Year 3: $265,000 for a minimum panel of 1250 ($212 per patient)


So, the current state of matters is:

1. Naturopaths have a legal scope nearly identical to MDs to prescribe drugs, order tests and perform minor surgery (albeit not publically funded but they do sneaky stuff like bill botox through extended health under ""naturopath services"")

2. Midwives get paid more to do maternity care than I do (per patient: $1060.01 for prenatal care, $1,060.01 for labour and delivery, $1,060.01 for postpartum care)

3. Now nurse practitioners who have less training are being paid more than MDs to provide care to patients of lower complexity",medicine,t3_bp2y1n

"Observations (okay it is a rant against pseudomedicine) about outpatient medicine from a hospitalist turned PCPI've transitioned to primary care from hospital medicine and boy has it been a transition. Overall I love it but coming from an academic bubble to hospital medicine and now to outpatient has been eye opening. 

Both jobs are difficult, and I hate the pissing match about which is harder (Primary care vs hospitalist). I can have a ton of complaints about hospital medicine but I wanted to rant for a bit about what outpatient medicine has seemed to become or be in my neck of the woods.

 I have a new practice, opened doors in 2018. So far I've seen about 2500 new patients in about 9 months. I would consider myself well trained and open to discuss many evidence based non traditional techniques with patients if they are interested.

I've noticed quite a few patients who come from other doctors who have what I would consider BS diagnosis such as 

1. ""leaky gut syndrome""
2. ""seronegative chronic lyme disease""
3. ""adrenal fatigue""
4. ""HPA axis mismatch/dysregulation"" (with all normal blood tests. Theory is that the mismatch occurs at various times of day and that labs don't always pick up on that so I'm told by some patients who were told by their other doctor)
5. ""chronic EBV infection""



These diagnosis appear to be pushed by local doctors who bill themselves as functional medicine doctors. I've looked up all of these doctors online and they all are cash pay, are board certified MD's, and all sell their own supplements. One is an OBGYN, one is an ENT, and 2 others in my area are family practice all practicing as functional medicine doctors giving patients these types of diagnosis.


Many of these patients keep buying these supplements pushed by these doctors and stool genetic assay tests to determine ""how healthy their gut biome is"" and to me this is bordering on unethical since I don't know exactly what seems to be going on. I've requested records from their clinic but not once have they ever faxed me a record. One clinic in particular has a print out of the same 5 diagnosis and 5 treatment plans. He circles whichever he diagnosis the patient with, circles treatment plan and which supplement of his they should buy. I only found this out after a patient brought the form in to my clinic from what one of these doctors gave them.

Another group in town deals with mental health but has started to do bio identical hormones and botox.

Coming from an academic center, what in the hell has happened to outpatient medicine? Is this just isolated to my area or is this a problem all over the US? 

I have to spend so much time talking these people about why they don't have adrenal fatigue and the fact that they are tired all day is most likely from being on their phone/computer, and having terrible sleep hygiene or anxiety. 

Dealing with chronic pain and benzos seekers seems to be so much easier than dealing with these patients who are convinced that all labs are wrong and that their functional medicine doctor knows better than every other doctor.

"Clinical boundaries re: death of a patient?Three years ago, as an oncology volunteer, I got to know my patients quite well. One was particularly fond of long conversations. He enjoyed sharing his life stories and adventures. I volunteered almost everyday, and he, his roommate and I would spend hours sharing stories and jokes and sometimes singing. (It was all completely within the realm of what volunteers do in this program.)

Near the end of my stint, he gave me a handwritten note expressing his best wishes.

Limiting the information I write; but, he worked in an industry that suffered a major accident some years ago. His illness (and ultimate passing) were a delayed result of that accident. The note he gave me was written on a postcard from that industry, and he signed his name alongside the name of his specific company/workplace.

After a few months, I left the volunteer position.

Just recently, I found the card again and google-searched his name (it was impulsive; I understand now this was a HIPAA violation). I learned that he passed away. I was and still am devastated; he was a person with incredible integrity. I feel an impulse to grieve somehow -- I carry his card with me; I visited a memorial for his industry, and wandered around for hours, crying a little and remembering our time.

But I am afraid this is all inappropriate and boundary-crossing. I broke HIPAA by searching his name and learning information I was not entitled to (although.... if he gave me a signed card with his name, and I searched based on that information not information from the hospital, is that still HIPAA-breaking?).

**It also seems really inappropriate to visit the memorial or 'grieve' someone who I had a purely clinical relationship with.**

Am I correct that reading about a former patient online, carrying the card and visiting a memorial are inappropriate? Should I be backing off and/or addressing my own boundary issues with a psychologist to prevent future boundary-crossing?

Or, is it in fact acceptable and normal to 'grieve' a patient in this manner?

One more question: He really wanted me to meet his wife, and her to meet me, because she was so important to him and appeared in all his stories (and apparently enjoyed telling her about his volunteer as well). When she visited, he made a point of introducing us, and we all sat together and shared stories. I assume it would be inappropriate and/or HIPAA-non-compliant to contact his wife, share some memories, and extend my condolences?

I have also been tempted to walk by the company/workplace he signed in his note, just to see what it the place was like that meant so much to him. Would that be wrong as well?

Thank you for any guidance; **please believe that I truly regret any boundaries I have crossed,** and am genuinely trying to learn how to navigate them correctly as I move forwards.",medicine,t3_bobhxj

"A case of missed poisoning by propylene glycolI'm at a small clinic for my student internship.

She had been vomiting daily (not blood) for the past week and gives a history of peptic ulcer disease, though she denies melena stools. 

She's not pale, but obviously dehydrated. Pulse is over 100 and systolic is in the 90s so we can't rule out an upper GI bleed in addition to dehydration. We start a normal saline infusion and push 10mg metoclopramide IVI as we wait for an ambulance (we don't have the facilities to do a blood gas or urgent blood tests, let alone endoscopy).

On further history, she had hernia repair surgery two months ago, though she can't say which type. Abdominal exam reveals a ~5cm vertical scar above the umbilicus and mild epigastric tenderness. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient seems a bit disinhibited, which we chalk up to dehydration and possible hemorrhage  (she denied any substance use). 

I happened to meet the paramedic who transferred the patient the next day. Turns out the Hb was normal, blood gas revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis and toxicology screen was positive for propylene glycol. It wasn't clear yet whether this was a suicide attempt or a poisoning attempt.

"Price discrepancies of more than 200 percent between what private health plans pay for hospital services and what Medicare pays.https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR3033.html

&gt;Relative prices for hospital outpatient services were 293 percent of Medicare rates on average, far higher than the average relative price for inpatient care (204 percent of Medicare rates).

RAND recommendations:

&gt;Employers can exert pressure on their health plans and hospitals to shift from discounted charge contracts to contracts based on a multiple of Medicare or some other prospective case rates.

&gt;Employers can use networks and benefit designs to move patient volume away from high-priced, low-value hospitals and hospital systems.

&gt;Employers can encourage expanded price transparency by participating in existing state-based all-payer claims databases and promoting development of new ones.

&gt;Transparency by itself is likely insufficient to reduce hospital prices, and employers may need state or federal policy interventions to rebalance negotiating leverage between hospitals and employer health plans.

"Help: Selecting sturdy camera and mounting it in a factory?Hello everyone,

I have a rather unusual application, and so my frail knowledge in cameras calls for the cavalry that is this sub.

I   am conducting research in recycling facilities. To keep it short, the   garbage stream needs to be studied in order to develop better machines   for sorting. There was no publicly available database of recyclable   stream footage, and so my group has to make their own footage. We need   to film a couple of hours of garbage stream.

\*\*Essentially\*\*—I   have to select and install a camera in the industrial hellhole that is  a  recycling facility. The camera may have to be mounted on giant  machines  that vibrate. The goal is to record hours of incoming trash,  before,  and after sorting. Naturally, two cameras needed. One prior to,  and one  after sorting.

\*\*Additionally\*\*—I   have to select not only a camera, but also an adequate  mount/attachment  system. I might also need a damper to reduce  vibrations. Perhaps you  know of a standard/conventional/better way of  handling vibrations when  needing to shoot footage; a way that doesn't  involve an ad-hoc DIY  solution using mechanical dampers.

The   camera won't exactly be punched, but it will be in a filthy   environment, where moisture, temperature, and cleanliness are   unpredictable.

The only thing we   could think of is a GoPro, since it is built for extreme conditions, yet   I have close to no idea if its mount is adequate, or if there is a way   to reduce vibrations without resorting to mechanical dampers.

Does anyone have any ideas? Or at least know which directions to point me to?

"Breguet Range Equation - Dimensional AnalysisHello /r/engineering,

I'm currently working on a personal aircraft design project and I'm having trouble getting sensible results out of the Breguet Range Equation. It seems like a unit issue. I'm using the form for propeller driven aircraft:

R = (eta/c)*(L/D)*ln(W_i/W_f)

eta, L/D, and the weight fraction are all dimensionless, so all the dimensions must coming from the c term for specific fuel consumption. The units for this value are commonly given in lb/(hr-SHP), which from a Mass-Length-Time perspective come out to L^-1 which makes sense for a range calculation. 

The problem is that the value of 1 lb/(hr-SHP) is not equal to any common length unit so it needs to be converted in order for the resulting range value to make any sense. I used the following to convert to nautical miles (NM): 1HP = 550ft-lb/s, 3600s = 1hr, 1NM = 6076ft.

1lb/(hr-SHP) = 6072/(550*3600) NM^-1 ~ .003 NM^-1

For a sample calculation to ensure my code works I'm running the numbers for a C172S max range cruise at 12,000ft. Using values from the POH, the SFC is approximately .5 lb/(hr-BHP) which agrees with SFCs of aircraft in that class. The L/D ratio is assumed to be 16, which is based on empirical data for similar aircraft. The weight fraction W_i/W_f is approx. 1.5 based on POH values for MTOW and ZFW. Lastly, I used eta = .8 (common assumption for propulsive efficiency).

Converting the SFC from lb/(hr-SHP) to NM^-1, you'd get an SFC of ~.0015NM^-1

So the final expression for range is:

R = (.8/.0015 NM^-1)*16*ln(1.5) = 3460NM, which is almost 6X greater than the performance chart result of 600NM.

Is there something I'm doing wrong with the units? Perhaps it's a lbm vs. lbf error, but it doesn't seem to be off by a factor of 32ft/s^2. Any help with this would be greatly appreciated. I've found several online resources with derivations of the Breguet Range Equation in different forms, but none with a sample calculation showing what units were used for c.",engineering,t3_dk0kxj

"Best shape for large ice block?I run a coolsuit in my (very) amateur racecar, and rather than using standard ice cubes in the reservoir to chill the water, I use large blocks, which I make by freezing 2l juice bottles full of water. 
However the shape of these bottles (concave sides) means I have to cut them open to get the ice out, and it’s a PITA. 

I was wondering if there’s an optimal shape of container that would make it “easy” to get a large block of ice out of it. Seems to me that with a straight sided container you’re up against all that friction from the surface area, but it may be the best bet. Would a slightly tapered container work better, or is it a case of “if the surface area is the same then no difference”? In which case the flexibility of the plastic to “squeeze” the ice out would matter more than the shape?

In my current role, I am still getting used to some of the many hats I wear, including technical publications.  

I maintain approximately 500 instruction/installation manuals for a few dozen families of products.  We're using MS Word, but with no Styles, manually assigned Figure numbers, manually generated tables of contents, manual control of whitespace, etc.  We don't keep old versions, and we use Windows Explorer to store and retrieve manuals.  Obviously, there are better ways to do things.  

Should I start migrating existing documents from novice-level Office 97 documents to using more of the features of Word 2010?  I switched a few manuals over to use Styles and Multi-Level Numbered Lists.  Although this feels like the right way to do it, I'm not sure it's worth the effort except for new documents.  Also, there are no new documents.  They're all copied and pasted together from old documents.

Should I be researching and trying out some manuals-specific software?  My biggest concern there is the learning curve will be too steep for my colleagues and successors, and I'll leave behind a nightmare of unmaintainable document fragments when I'm no longer in this role.

"Imperial vs metric industry standards - why are imperial industry standards obsessed with gauges and table lookups?The metric vs imperial debate has been done to death. This isn't really about why inches or centimeters are a better unit. This is rather - speaking as an engineer in the US - why are imperial engineering standards so obsessed with number gauges and other layers of abstractions that virtually always require one to look up a table to get useful dimensions, where as metric just delivers it straight as a useful dimension? For instance:

**Metric**: Sheet metal thicknesses are described in millimeters.

**Imperial**: Sheet metal thicknesses are described in number gauges, which are different for different materials (#10 gauge steel is 0.1345"" thick, #10 gauge aluminum is 0.1019"" thick). Requires table lookup to get thickness (~~interestingly, the gauge table for steel is written into US federal law, at [15 USC §206](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title15-section206&amp;num=0&amp;edition=prelim)~~ these are approximate sizes, do not use for design)

**Metric**: Wire sizes are described in mm^2. You can calculate stuff directly from this, though I suppose realistically, you are probably going to look up a table for the most important stuff (diameter, ampacity, etc.). Though you can directly get useful data for things related to area, e.g. you can compare 10mm^2 and 25mm^2 wire and conclude that the 25mm^2 wire will have 2.5x less resistance or that it will be 2.5X heavier for a given length. 

**Imperial**: Wire sizes are described in American Wire Gauge (AWG), and for larger wires, kilo circular mils (because 250π mil^2 is clearly a sensible unit). Requires a table lookup to get any sort of useful dimensions.

**Metric**: Drill bits are described in millimeters, and you can buy them in 0.1mm increments. You can just go out and buy a 3.5mm drill bit.

**Imperial**: Drill bits come in fractional, numbered, and lettered sizes. The latter two require looking up a table to get decimal inches to then use. Also the Letter E drill is the same as the 1/4"" drill, because why not.

**Metric**: Tap Drill Diameter = Nominal Diameter - Thread Pitch, for standard 60° screw threads. E.g. for M4x0.7, the tap drill is 4mm - 0.7mm = 3.3mm.

**Imperial**: Tap drills always requires looking up a table because drill bits are not described in decimal inches, and because thread pitch is given as TPI rather than inches/thread.

There is a possible world that still uses imperial units, but sheet metal sizes are given in inches or mils, and where wire gauge is given in inches^2 or something, and where drill bits are always given as decimals. Is this some pre-internet conspiracy by bookmakers and printers to sell more tables, or like everything else imperial, vestiges of an older way to do things because that's how it's always been done? The only advantages I see with the reliance on gauges and tables is that it makes it more clear what the standard available sizes are - e.g. 10 gauge steel is probably a commonly available size that I can design to, whereas it's unclear if 6.5mm is a standard sheet metal size (though sticking to whole and half millimeter sizes are generally a safe bet). Though there are exceptions to this - you tend to not see many odd AWG wire gauges for instance, e.g. 13 AWG wire is very uncommon.

Also, not directly related to having to look up a table, but:

**Metric**: Countersinks are 90 degrees. This makes relating head diameter to head depth easy, since depth = 1/2 diameter (since head diameters are usually published, but not head heights). This also lets you use chamfering tools for countersinking. Also it's a freaking right angle.

**Imperial**: Countersinks are 82 degrees. I don't really see any advantages here. Why?",engineering,t3_dijcde
"Can insert molded parts be modeled in FEA?I am trying to compare two design options for my company. One design is a subassembly containing plastic (PA GF 30%) components. The other design incorporates in-molded metal plates to some of the plastic pieces. I am trying to evaluate how the in-molded plate will perform. 

I have evaluated the plastic design in Fusion 360 Simulation, but am unsure how to set up an in-molded part. My thought process would be to subtract the metal body from the plastic body, bring the metal body back in, and treat them as two separate parts in the simulation with correct materials, just fully bonded to each other on all faces. Essentially, I would hope that assigns a separate stiffness matrix to all nodes associated with the metal plate. 

In implementation though, I am encountering numerous issues because the metal plate subtraction causes substantial geometry issues with my plastic part. In production, this would be less of an issue, but in simulation, it is creating very bad mesh quality. 

I am not finding a lot on forums about running FEA simulations of insert-molded parts. Does anyone have any experience performing these studies?

"Most Efficient Post Frame StructureHi, I'm looking for input from those of you that design post frame buildings on what the most efficient design tends to be. My design experience is limited to masonry, steel, concrete, and traditional stick built wood structures so this is a little out of my wheelhouse. I would imagine builders could share valuable info on cost and what they generally end up building as well.

For a little bit of background, rough dimensions would be 40'x60', risk cat II, 115 mph wind, 35 PSF flat roof snow, eave height 16'.

My question is: what is the sweet spot on column spacing, truss spacing, etc? 

Obviously larger column spacing means less holes to dig and less posts, but it also means larger members and purlins can only span so far under wind loads. 

Same goes for trusses. If trusses can be placed only on top of posts then the beams along the eave that would normally cary the trusses can be downsized. Less trusses means less cost there, but the larger spacing requires purlins to be rotated, up-sized, and hung from engineered hangers which increases cost. 

Thoughts? Parts of the picture I'm missing?

Cheers!",engineering,t3_ditani

"Electric Vehicle Creator Community  

Hello!

I'm posted this to the [r/opensource](https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/) community first because I believe the collective efforts of many people, each with their own knowledge and experience, is an unstoppable force. With the cost of manufactured goods rising and the availability of hardware increasing (resulting in lower prices on occasion) our ability to create free of any constraints is growing day by day.

Jumping right into it-

I'm looking to create a community of makers, DIY enthusiasts, coders, engineers, and anyone who is interested to take on **electric vehicles**.

I'm inspired by the **RepRap Project** and how successful it was/is in essentially building a solid foundation to be tweaked, altered, improved, etc. This can be especially helpful in regards to vehicles being as there are so many different configurations.

Based on my limited knowledge, the main areas of development would be:

Batteries/Battery management

Electrical distribution system

Mechanical (ways of mounting motors, batteries, etc with the ability to be used across different platforms)

Hardware/software

Electronics (redundant?)

Internal combustion to electric integration (example: braking systems, ~~gas~~ pedal, etc)

Vehicle dynamics (gonna need some real smarties for this one)

This is an extremely rough list- input appreciated.

I don't want to overdefine this because I want this entire thing to be created and formed based on input from the different communities I'll be posting this to.

"Disadvantages of harmonic drives[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic\_drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_drive)

I just learned about harmonic drives today, and they seem very interesting. However, most sources only list advantages, and very few that I could quickly find explained any of the disadvantages. I did some brief googling and I thought I'd pass along the information here. The main advantages are an extremely compact coaxial design for very high gear ratios (1:100-300), no backlash, and low complexity and weight. 

The disadvantages I can find seem to be

* Tendency for wind-up   [source (pdf)](http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/mechanical_engineering/Harmonic_Drives.pdf)
* Damage due to shocks or environmental conditions (how is that different from any other mechanism?, see above for source)
* High elasticity and nonlinear stiffness and damping [source (pdf)](http://imim.pl/files/archiwum/Vol1_2012/21.pdf.pdf) (why does this matter?)
* Lower efficiency"" (90% at best)  [source](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1997ESASP.410..265M)
* Subject to bearing drag  (see above)
* Few suppliers  (see above)
* More susceptible to fatigue damage [source](https://www.laifualdrive.com/news/advantages-and-disadvantages.html)
* Large moment of inertia and starting torques, not suitable for low power drives (see above)
* Not able to yield gear ratios less than 1:35 (see above)
* Instantaneous transmission ratio is not constant. (no idea what this means, see above)
* Difficult to dissipate heat (see above)

These devices seem really cool, but I thought I would catalog the disadvantages here since they are rarely discussed and I didn't see any previous posts addressing them.",engineering,t3_diei8r

"Why not to become P.Eng. licensed?This may seem like an odd post given I'm a licensed Professional Engineer (P.Eng.) in western Canada who has greatly benefited from earning my P.Eng. several years ago. With that said in order to have a balanced approach as well a common question I get, I thought I'd start a discussion on why somebody may not want to become a P.Eng. member. Having discussed this topic with other P.Eng. members, EITs, with both Canadians and new immigrants, I feel qualified to state this. Again don't get me wrong, I personally recommended anybody who practices engineering register. With that said I thought I'd post the top five reasons why somebody may not want become a P.Eng. Anybody out there who is also a P.Eng., in the process or registering for their P.Eng., an EIT, or just interested in the topic feel free to add to the discussion. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Costs: Fees from your provincial association come in many forms. Firstly the P.Eng. application fee ($500). If you register as an Engineer-in-Training (EIT), there will be a fee for that along with annual membership EIT fees until you register as a P.Eng. which leads to even higher membership fees of roughly $450 / year depending on which province. There is also the cost to take the required law / ethics Professional Practice Exam (PPE) along with the cost of the text books. If you require an interview as part of your application and have to reschedule, there's a fee for that too. Finally once you obtain your P.Eng. there is an annual membership fee and the cost of continuing professional development (CPD) education to maintain your 30 hours per year of CPD hours. Note that if your firm pays for these fees then maybe this isn't an issue. Here are some fee examples:  [Fees](https://www.apega.ca/apply/professional-member/) in AB &amp; [fees](https://www.egbc.ca/Become-a-Member/Fees#Application%20(Assessment)%20Fees) in BC.
2. Time: Firstly it's a lot of time to even apply for your P.Eng. license. At a minimum you'll need to send in your University transcripts, provide work summary reports of your projects in many different areas of engineering, you'll need to coordinate your P.Eng. references to vouch for you, study and write your PPE exam . If an interview is required which is fairly common these days for applicants, that will require time to prepare and do along with what's assigned to you in the post interview in the form of further studies and work experience. So it can take months even years to complete the process to apply. Also even after you obtain your P.Eng., you'll need to maintain it with CPD hours of roughly 30 hours per year depending on your province. On top of that it's common at least once in your career to be called for a random professional practice review which will involve paper work, time to prepare, an interview at your firm with an Interviewer, and post interview items to complete to maintain your P.Eng. license. 
3. May not be needed for your career: If you're an engineering graduate who doesn't officially practice engineering then maybe it won't enhance your career or only by a litle. I say this because there are engineering graduates who work in say pure project management, contracting, construction, leadership, or tech roles for example and although it's good to add the P.Eng. to your business card and email footers, it can be questionable how much of a difference that can make. Especially given that many others in your same role aren't even engineering graduates. Then it could come down to just having a personal / professional milestone which there is nothing wrong with but something to point out. 
4. Possible pressure to take on positions you're not ready for yet and / or seal / sign engineering documents: This doesn't happen to all P.Eng. members but some who work in consulting firms who hire a much higher ratio of Technologists / Designers vs Engineers may at tight deadlines be demanded to seal sign engineering documents prepared by somebody else at the firm because you are the P.Eng.. Obviously the Engineer should either say no or do a thorough review of the work first and document it. Also if the Engineer isn't that familiar with the Designer who prepared the work, he / she should interview them to verify their experience and document all of it. Again easier said then done at the 11th hour with project deadlines. New / young P.Eng. members may be asked to take on Engineer of Record (EoR) roles too early in their career which for example likely happened in the[Mount Poly disaster](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/mount-polley-mine-ex-engineers-warned-tailings-pond-getting-large-1.2732314) in BC. 
5. No guarantee of excellence: Just like it's not impossible to be the worst Project Manager in the world and still be PMP certified, it's also not impossible to be a bad Engineer and still be a licensed P.Eng. Does it happen often? I want to say no but it does happen. What a P.Eng. does confirm is that you have met the educational and work experience requirements to register as a licensed Engineer. 

Guys I want to end with a positive note. I could also come up with counter reasons against the my above points too. Also I understand that obtaining your P.Eng. and maintaining it shouldn't be too easy otherwise the accreditation would be less valuable and the public could suffer from having licnesed engineers in our society who shouldn't be signing off on engineering documents.

"Suggestions for predicting the displacement of a graph or force estimation.Hello

This question is aimed mostly to engineers but whoever believes he can handle it may give his valuable advice.

I have a tabular data set of Load/Displacements in Newton/mm of a material using an Instron Machine, applying compressive forces.

Those data are my reference or gold standard. The same material is depicted on images where unknown forces are applied to the object and the object deforms as it is a rubber material. I want to estimate the forces caused that deformation.

My idea is developing a model that measures each column of the image that the object is depicted under strain. I measure the heigh of the object in each image column and find the difference from the gold standard that I have. Sounds simple right? I was thinking an interpolation method to bridge the gaps between the gold standard and the measured data from the images. E.g. if the gold standard data for 5 Newton is 2 mm displacement from its original position (undeformed material), then how many newtons are required to displace the same object at 5 mm from its original position. Something like that.

Can you help with suggestions and ideas please?

Thanks in advance",engineering,t3_dh4b8t
"Does underground high voltage cabling = noise?There is a project to build a new 400kV power connector, and most people I guess would prefer it to be underground.  They give this excuse as to why they aren't going to bury it.  Is it credible?  What would be the source of the electrical noise?  Wouldn't proper shielding/padding mitigate this?

&gt;The conclusion is that it is possible to cable up to approx. 15% of the route. That equals 26 km. If more is wired, there will be a high risk of malfunctions or damage to the entire grid. Among other things, there is a risk that distorted voltage, also called noise, exceeds the permissible limit values in large parts of the transmission network. This can lead to shortened service life and faults in components in the mains supply and in consumer electrical appliances.",engineering,t3_dgxpor
"Double I beam bendingEdit with final result: Was overtired from working too much and used a random online calculator for my forces. The calculator doubled the tonnage. I didn't check it's math and just assumed I did it wrong to start with. (Yes I feel quite stupid. Hydraulics is part of my job, so I should have caught that was a lot of force.) My orginal design yielded 18 tons, but I may have figured on a little lower PSI. The pistons actually can put out 20 tons on the stock backhoe relief pressure. The beam setup was designed for 20ton, and I was glad to see someone verified that math below. I can now comfortably replace what was supposed to be the temporary wedge with a solid steel one and not worry about my new 4-way bending the beam. Thanks for all the replies!

Original below:

I came across a couple of clearance pistons at tractor supply and was in need of a log splitter with no money. I am used to working with single acting cylinders and took measurements and ran the numbers based on rod size. I came up with about 9 tons each, so the pair is 18.

I used the only beams I had available in scrap, which are 3/16"" x 4"" tall x 2 3/4"" wide. I set them side by side and welded full length top and bottom. I capped the ends and added short plates in the I on the sides.

This mounts on my tractor's backhoe, and uses its hydaulics.

Knowing this was a little on the low power side for what I need I made a narrow wedge from 1/8"" steel with center reinforcements. Then I was a little shocked to find I could cross cut the grain. I decided I'd give a 4-way wedge a shot and ripped the welded on wedge off above the weld.

I realized that I had stupidly miscalculated the force, due to double acting pistons having a larger cylinder than rod. Proper calculations (*wrong, see above)  yield more like 40 tons of force. Two 3.5"" pistons at 2100psi max.

I'd like to be able to use as much force as possible with a 4-way, but don't have more I beams and weight is already an issue on the backhoe. I'm rrying to determine, with an 8"" tall 1"" thick wedge, how much force these two little I beams welded together can take, and trying to do it. The beam is about 5' long and it has an 18"" throw.

Anyone have any skills in such a calculation? I can get it eventually I'm sure, but I'd like to get a new wedge on ASAP, and it'll take me a while to figure out the math and hope I didn't mess it up.

"Canadian engineer on Working Holiday Visa in Australia: Yay or Nay???I am a mechanical engineer with 6 years of experience looking to move from Canada to Australia around August next year with my gf and would really appreciate any advice people can give on my visa plan / plan in general. 

Plan right now is for us to come down on WHVs, buy a camper van, and immediately start our 3 months of rural work (spending that time to outfit our sweet sweet van baby). Upon finishing our 3 months we plan to road trip around the country for a month before working in either Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane.

"ELI5: How come lots of expressway entrances/exits are merged (2 lanes into one) instead of just having one lane traffic?For example

[https://www.google.com/maps/@39.3057248,-76.7493966,471m/data=!3m1!1e3](https://www.google.com/maps/@39.3057248,-76.7493966,471m/data=!3m1!1e3)

The exit from I70 onto I695N is 2 lane into 1, and the exit from I70 to I695S have 1 lane exit. Every morning when I commute through there for work, it's always jammed up with cars going to I695N, but decently fast moving traffic from I70 to I695S. Both ways on I695 are jammed at that point.

So I was thinking, how come people who designed the exits can't make it just one lane exit instead of 2 lane merged into one when the merged lane always causes more traffic (due to idiots in cars or just slow merge?)

I guess this also applies at toll lanes. Instead of having 10 toll stations, why not have the same amount of toll stations as the highway lanes but cashless? Wouldn't that cause less traffic and save more money?

&amp;#x200B;

My though process is that in queueing theory, 2 lanes into one would work perfectly if people merge like they're supposed to. But in reality, that doesn't happen because you will always have people that just refuse to let others merge, and the car in the other lane have to stop and wait for an available opening. This will slowly piles up cars and traffic jam occurs.

Like that intersection in my example, the 2 lane into 1 always jams, but the one lane exit never jams even though the amount of traffic going through these 2 exits are fairly even. In addition, the interstate right after the exit is more jammed/slower coming from the 1 lane exit than the 2 lane exit, yet the 2 lane exit have longer buildup than the one lane exit (Usually no build up).

I just thought that if it's only one lane exit, it should prevent possible ""staggering"" queues (Cars that are supposed to merge in theory but end up waiting for the next open window). I think it's more organized having a single file line than multiple line merge into one (Look at a single file line with multiple cashier check out vs multiple lines with multiple cashier checkouts simulation).

"Good or Professional Practices When Working on Mechanical Engineering ProjectsHi,

I'm  a recent biomedical engineer graduate looking to get hired somewhere (hopefully soon), but in the meantime I'm trying to improve my design  skills in CAD as well as my overall ability to manage my projects. I  wasn't taught much practical mechanical engineering in terms of CAD and  design components at uni, so I mostly learned from online sources. Also I  haven't had industrial exposure yet, so I feel that I don't know the  proper approach to creating a project from start to finish. As in when I  have an idea, I do some sketching on paper, then write down the  equations to see how well the physics lines up with my imagination, but  then I jump into Solidworks and start making up my assembly. I feel that  this isn't the ideal approach, especially when working in a team where  there might be some back and forth before actual work gets done. Thus I  have a few questions to ask you wise people of reddit engineering:

1  - Is there a more appropriate workflow that one could follow (I know  everyone has their own way and I need to find mine) or a general  template for approach? I've been using 3D printing to create my parts so  I'm use to quickly printing and iterating, rather than thoroughly  testing using FEA, which I do for large or complex components but  sometimes I just go quick and dirty.

2 - I am missing out on something that would make it obvious that I didn't study mechanical engineering?

3 - Are there any skills I can practice to make me more industry-ready for when I do finally get that job?

4  - Are there any good sources for mechanical structure design, for  example a book that tells you what structure design would be ideal for  what loading configuration and explains why they are optimal?

5  - Are there any shortcuts or small skills that you learnt over the  years that one can get with a bit of practice (like learning your key  map in Solidworks) but saves minutes/hours/days of work down the line?",engineering,t3_df9nih

"Exploiting Chromatic Aberration for Multi-Band Concentrated PhotovoltaicsI've had this idea for a while and haven't been able to find anything similar to it in literature, so I thought I'd share it here for feedback. I don't intend to seek a patent.

The idea, as stated in the title; is to exploit the fact that chromatic aberration creates different focal points for different frequencies of light. This exploit is achieved by stacking rings of PV cells with different band gaps to form a small rod where each cell is exposed to light that matches its band-gap. This would replace multi-junction solar cells which are expensive because they're incredibly difficult to manufacture. The stacked cells don't have to have matching lattice structures or anything, they can be physically separate, bulk-manufactured cells.

[Here's a diagram](https://imgur.com/qHErxYb) which shows an 11-junction stack around a rod that can provide cooling and bus-routing. The rings don't even have to be circular, they can be polygonal prisms if it eases manufacturing.

"Help making an earbud output static (yes, on purpose!)Hello!

I'm making my own version of Doctor Who's sonic screwdriver and I'm a little stuck at the sound. I want to cut up some old earbuds and make one of them output a loud static sound, or even better something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cs1FQOw5QI4).

I've never soldered or anything so if possible I'd just like to be able to easily cut up and sellotape some things =P. I'd like to link the sound to a button press too, it's going to light up a torch and play the sound.

If headphones aren't the best option, what would be even better is hooking up a mini motor, preferably a loud one that vibrates for best effect.

Thanks!

"Do articulated vehicles (mine trucks, tractors etc) use locked axles or open (free spinning)I'm doing some planning for a future project.

"Cleaning shredded plastic?So, I've been working on a side project to recycle PETE into 3D printer filament, and I've got most of the process sorted out, built a shredder, using a DIY vacuum chamber to dry the plastic, but I need to clean it after it goes through the shredder to remove grease and metal particles, as well as anything else.

"How to prevent machine from overheating?Hello dear engineers,

I am not an engineer and I don't exactly know where else I would go with this question, so hopefully one of you might have a Geistesblitz!

I am in possession of a Premier Wonder Grinder. It is a machine initially having been made for grinding down rice, legumes, beans etc. in order to make Indian delicacies. It is a rather simple and small device that consist of two granite stone rollers that grind down the ingredients in a steel drum.

[https://www.amazon.com/Premier-Small-Wonder-Grinder-SS/dp/B004OPIBV2](https://www.amazon.com/Premier-Small-Wonder-Grinder-SS/dp/B004OPIBV2)

I use it to make chocolate however. The last time I've made a batch, the machine overheated for some reason and part of the machine melted down a bit and changed shape (the plastic). Not so good.

I made some more research and learned that when they made the machine, they didn't have the possibility of also making chocolate with it in mind. So another company took the machine, made some adaptations and upgraded it for that purpose, one thing they did was add a cut-off switch to prevent overheating. As a result, you can let the machine run continuously (it needs to run 20 hours + to refine and conch chocolate).

So now I have two machines, one I can run and leave the house safely supposedly thanks to the cut-off switch, and the other one, well I don't want to risk burning my house down, but I don't want to stay at my place and be watching the machine for 20 hours, either!

Does anyone have a suggestion what I could do? Do you think it would be possible to add a custom-made ,,cut-off'' switch to the Wonder Grinder as well and prevent it from overheating? Is there another way I can make sure this thing will run safely while I am absent?",engineering,t3_ddaarf
"I made a podcastA while back, I gauged interest in a podcast interviewing retired engineers, and the idea was popular here. Unfortunately, due to various circumstances that wasn’t able to come to fruition.

Instead, I’ve pushed my company to let me make a podcast. They agreed, but like all things that are new at companies, they didn’t want to invest much. So, I utilized the limited resources I had to put this podcast together. The sound could be better. I wanted to spend longer outlining it. I didn’t have a guest. I’m not great at music editing. I recorded it in my closet for sound attenuation with my laptop sitting on a clothes hamper, with my microphone balancing on my keyboard. Needless to say, there is a lot of room for improvement, but like most engineering projects, it has to ship even if it’s not perfect.

I have no doubt future episodes will get better as I learn and gain traction and earn the right from my company to spend more time on it.

My goal with each episode is to help different parts of a company (engineering, sales, marketing, ownership) see eye to eye on how things are changing in the world, and how that affects the business and make the appropriate changes to stay ahead of the curve. So, it’s not a purely engineering podcast, but it will always tie in something that would matter to the engineering team, even trends. The general formula will be pointing out a historical shift, illustrating how it can apply to a modern company, and then give an example/plan to take some concrete steps towards it, while also providing a framework to start an internal conversation. 

This first episode was about how marketing has changed, word of mouth is now 100-1000X more powerful than the past due to the network effect of smart phones and social media, how that makes it more important that engineers think through ways to make products more interesting to people so that they share it. If it helps you all pitch more interesting projects to your boss, that would be awesome!

This project is still young, and I want to get better, but it will only happen with practice and feedback. If any of you have been gracious enough to read this far and are willing to spend 13 minutes to listen to my first podcast, maybe on a walk or your commute, I’d be grateful. The link is below:

"Surviving an impact test - Help With an industrial phone case design problemHi all,

I have inherited a project involving creating a rugged case for a phone. At the moment, the materials are set and the design is largely so. I am trying to find a solution to a problem regarding an impact test.     
The general description of the product is a metallic device case with sapphire glass front and rear panels protected by 60A EPDM bumpers on the corners. The case can effectively be considered to have a front and rear component which the respective glass panels are cemented to. The device inside the case is an iPhone XR. The construction is such that the front glass panel is directly in contact with the phone screen, and there is a Poron pad between the phone and the rear glass panel. The rear glass panel has transverse supports; the front panel does not. The corner bumpers lift the case 7 mm off of the testing platform.     
The impact test involves a 1 kg impactor with a spherical head (25.4 mm dia) being dropped from 0.2 m onto the center of each glass panel. The glass must survive the test without cracking.     
In its current state, the case can survive the impact on the rear panel but not the front. The front glass panel fails, but the phone inside is not damaged.     
If possible, I need to be able to find a solution without making major changes to the design.",engineering,t3_dch7pn

"How to mask humming noise of bathroom ventilation fan from downstairs apartmentHi, 

Apologies if this is not the correct forum to post this question. 

I recently began to notice a low constant humming noise in my apartment. It is very audible when I lie on my bed (but better when I got up from the bed). I was initially very confused. But after some investigation, I realized that it is from the bathroom ventilation fan of my downstairs neighbor. I actually went down to talk to him to find out. He switched off the fan, and that low humming noise in my apartment immediately disappeared. So it seems that the humming noise is transmitted to my bedroom by vibration of his ceiling. 

He said he would try not to run the fan all the time, but it was still on all night last night, which affected my sleep. 

I may eventually request that he consider switching it off during the night, although I don't know how that request will go. 

If I want to do something on my end to mask the noise, what are my options? This is what the ventilation fan looks like in my apartment with the cover removed (I assume it is the same thing in his):https://i.imgur.com/lwi1Uqz.jpg 

For completeness of information, the fan seems to be controlled by a humidity thermostat . 

I know there are white (and pink) noise machines out there. Would they be effective in masking the low humming noise in this case?

"I have ideas on how to improve all types of digital cameras in low light and/or high dynamic range scenes. What are your thoughts?I do photography and teach myself technical stuff on my own time. I use it for problem solving and looking for opportunity. I oberserved problems digital cameras have in low light scenes of different types.

For candlelight scenes with candle flames, there are extreme gaps between bright and dark. The flames and the areas reflecting off the flames matter. The black areas don't. It's nearly impossible to capture the two that matter without clipping the flames. Black areas that reflect almost no light mislead auto exposure systems. My solution is to have the AE system assign similar areas to subgroups (strata). If a region does not reflect enough light, it's ignored. If it emits light rapidly, it will tell the camera to lower the gain applied to that region. The calculation of the scene is based on the subgroups instead of the whole.

To handle the gap between bright and dark, analog gamma compression will be used. I got this idea from a 2014 research paper published in a journal. It is to fit a high ratio between bright and dark into a reasonable number range (10 or 12 bits per channel) without punishing intentional overexposure. To raise the gain and number values of what's reflected off the flames, the analog gain will be reduced for the flame regions while it stays the same everywhere else. The gain reduction can go from one half to one eighth. It's like having an ISO of 800 except for the flames which is reduced down to 100.

For moderate dynamic range ultra low light, analog gamma compression will be used too. This is to reduce downstream noise. The size of the recording area and photon count are less important than lowering the proportion of random fluctuations know as noise. It's why the Red Helium 8K has better performance at ISO 800 than the Phase One IQ4 150 MP at ISO 35. If the Red Helium is exposed for ISO 35, it'll just go to white.

The sensor will be the Organic Photoconductive Film CMOS sensor designed by Panasonic. The current applied to the film layer influences the analog gain. The charge storage is separate. This combined with analog gamma compression will help lower downstream noise.

For the RAW format, push/pull factor can be applied on camera and/or in post while in RAW mode. This raises or lowers the output number values before the profile/LUT gets applied. The profile/LUT will be used for preview only unless it's exported. After demosaicing, the gamma compressed numbers get converted into a 32 bit linear curve in the memory. The 32 bit values are not in storage but are instead used in the rendering stage. The RAW processor can also show what colors will get substituted when a specific profile/LUT is used. This will thus rely on analog gain and post conversion exposure value adjustment.

Ideally, I'd like the camera to blow the ultra low light multi-purpose Canon camera out of the water. I'd like for it to have APS-C/Super35 type sensor dimensions instead of full frame. This is to get more depth of field. Again, the electrical design influences noise more than photon count and recording area dimensions. The 8K resolution would be great too.

"If I casted an ingot of high carbon steel and applied vibrations until it cooled, would it behave different from standard casting?So I was in the dark alleys of youtube and started watching metal casting videos.  I noticed that some of the ingots that this person created had some pretty big holes in them while he was polishing.  This got me to wondering what would happen if I applied an ultrasonic vibration (or even something like a vibrating table) to the mold while it was cooling.

Theoretically, applying the vibrations should reduce the air bubbles trapped in the metal, but I imagine the vibrations would also impact the crystalline structure, keeping the grains small and making even something that is usually super brittle into something incredibly ductile.

"Rule of thumb for creep avoidance for part under constant stress.I've been scouring the internet recently and can't seem to find a real answer to my question. Hoping someone here could help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to determine what level of stress to stay below for a material to avoid creep. 

We have an extruded piece of plastic that clips onto a metal frame and sits outside all year long. After the first summer the pieces were falling off and had experienced quite a bit of creep. The pieces were very hard to install and were experiencing a high level of stress in the installed position. I've simulated the design and the new design is at a much lower stress level that I think should help. 

But is there any rule of thumb for avoiding creep? i.e. 1/3 of yield strength at 25deg C or something? Any equation? I can't find anything other than curves showing decreasing modulus over temps and stresses but for materials I""m not using.

"Mold Heat conduction CalculationOne of the things my company specializes in, is process cooling. Today my boss asked me to make a back-of-the-envelope-calculation for the following problem.    
 A steel plate with a surface area of 1 square meter and a width of 1 cm has to be pressed into a steel mould. The plate has a temperature of 700 degrees Celsius. Now for the tricky part: the mould cannot get any hotter than 50 degrees Celsius. So we have to cool down the mould.    
 I thought you should cool the mould by the amount of heat that is transferred from the plate. I calculated the following:    
The heat resistance of the plate:    
 R(plate) = d(plate)/lambda(plate)=0.01 [m]/(50 [W/m K])     
Then    
Q=UxAxDeltaT    
With    
Q = heat output    
U = thermal conductivity of steel = 1/R    
DeltaT= temperature difference between plate and mold    
So    
Q=2925 kW    
This would be the heat output of the steel plate when it comes into contact with the mould. This is greater than what I intuitively expected. So I tried Fourier's law:    
 Jx=-lambda x dT/dx x S=-50 [W/m K] *650 [K] /0.01 [m] x 1 [m^2 ]=3250 [kW].    
The same exaggeratedly large output appears.

"Potential tech startup scam: water based energyI believe an acquaintance of mine (keeping specifics confidential) is being taken in by a ""green"" tech startup scam.

The company claims to have breakthrough technology that they will not open up to academic scrutiny and have not filed for a patent yet. The tech claims to be a water based power cell with remarkable power yields.

Getting specifics has been extremely difficult and I am not clear if it is supposed to be some sort of turbine or an electrolysis box paired with a hydrogen engine based generator. Be that as it may, here are the essentials:
- The device consists of a box approximately 4x6x3 ft (American so deal with it).
- He claims it produces 5 kwh.
- Sometimes he claims it operates by itself; sometimes it requires a human on a bicycle for one hour for it to produce power.
- He claims it can get a home ""off grid"" so the owner will earn dividends from power companies (ask TEP customers about how well that works...).
- He claims to have made a breakthrough in water pipes tech using a ""grid"" system for equal pressure.
- He claims that the tech could power a naval torpedo.
- He claims the tech could eventually power wide body aircraft.
- He claims it will help save low income areas and disaster locations by providing cheap power.
- No mention of thermodynamics and/or fluid dynamics issues--other than some ""physicists"" are skeptical.
- Giving him the very wide benefit of the doubt, he has made no mention of electrolysis, hydrogen, etc.

I am not an engineer by education and background, though I do work in program management in the aerospace industry and used to work in fossil power. Therefore, all of the above reeks of total BS.

2. only the electric engine being used to move the car while the internal combustion engine is being used as a generator to the electric engine's batteries. Important that here any energy recovery mechanisms (like regenerative braking) should be disabled.

I was thinking about that recently and would like to know what basic configuration allows for a better efficiency (the fuel being used to power the car directly or to power the batteries).

I know many things interfere here and that probably a study using regular cars would not be so conclusive, since:

a. they should use the same car/model to be able to compare the results.

b. if the car will be pushed by the ICE there's no need for the additional weight of the batteries and electric engine in first place (so in this scenario the ICE only will be detrimented).

"Full 6 DOF Rigid Body DynamicsHey all. I've been working on a project trying to come up with a control scheme for a rocket with roll stabilization and gimbaled thrust vectoring. My problem right now is I'm having trouble nailing down the equations of motion including full 3d rotation. This is what I have so far...

For translation the equations are super simple;

Fx=m*a_x

Fy=m*a_y

Fz=m*a_z

For rotation I have the [euler equations for rigid body rotation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_equations_\(rigid_body_dynamics\))

M = Iα + ω x (Iω)


I'm pretty comfortable with these. What I'm having trouble with is measuring and storing the angular position of the body relative to some inertial frame. I've looked into [euler angles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles) which have gimbal lock, [rotation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) which are order dependant, and [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) which are elegant but I'm not sure how to incorporate them at this point. I've also learned a bit about manifolds and SO(3) which I don't really grasp right now.

**My question is this; How are 3D rotational dynamics modeled in real applications?**

At this point I'm not sure how to proceed, so any resources with an example application would be appreciated.",engineering,t3_d6ho5l

"I made a 1 page sketch and description of an idea for enabling optical zoom and MILC type image quality on thin smartphones. I have questions and could use constructive feedback.For background, I am a college student working on a BBA in Management at Houston Baptist University. I do photography on the side. I have many side interests and look for problems to solve, brainstorm, and seek ideas for solutions. I took an astronomy class too. The sketch and write up is in the link below.

[https://imgur.com/a/pqWzukY](https://imgur.com/a/pqWzukY)

I'm aware that the sketch is oversimplified. This one page sketch and description took 40 minutes.

An Asus phone with an a periscope enabled optical zoom is part of my inspiration; the device was still thin. The Light L16 uses and array of small lenses and sensors to in theory create the forerunner of one large sensor and lens. The problem is there is no optical zoom. The only ways to narrow the angle of view is to either change arrays or crop after capture. Cropping is destructive to the output. Changing arrays is a hassle.

I know visible light telescopes on Earth keep the image sensor still while the mirrors are repositioned to cope with Earth rotation and vibrations. Likewise, I'm concerned implementing an optical zoom in the array without proper corrections will create overlap deviation. Precise overlap is needed in the array help prevent stitching errors. What optical principles will help maintain precise overlap regardless of focal length? I know with refraction of visible light, shorter wavelengths (violet) get refracted more, causing purple fringing. What optical principles and elements will help correct for this problem to make this and other aberrations undetectable by the sensor? The lenses will have adjustable nominal aperture for depth of field control. I'd like to produce the forerunner of having the depth of field of the f/2.8-f/16 range of full frame DSLRs. Will it be okay to include an element that takes the light and concentrates it onto the sensor? This is to raise the effective aperture with the same iris opening. The periscope principle is to eliminate protruding parts from the thin device.

What are some resources and research articles worth reading for this idea? I'm thinking about working with some physics students at HBU to make it happen. I'll go to a mixer for physics students this Friday evening. I'm thinking about connecting with people in Rice and or UH in Houston. Who and what are some other ways to connect with people I can work with to make it happen? What feedback do you have? What other advice do you have? Thanks in advance.",engineering,t3_d6dspq

"Alternative to kevlar thread?Hi, I am doing a test where a trolley is being pulled to induce simple shear of a sample. (sample is fixed on the top and the trolley moves on the bottom). The calculations are very sensitive to the amount of displacement

There is a device which pulls the trolley via some Kevlar thread attached to a load cell. The expected displacement is known i.e it is expected the trolley will move 15 mm but it might only move 12 mm. I believe the loss is due to the thread stretching (rated to stetch up to 2% before breaking) and it is a long piece.

Ideas we have already to reduce the stretching would be to use a setup with a shorter piece of thread and to use a softer sample (both of which are planned). 

I am also wondering are there reasonable alternatives to a standard piece of Kevlar thread that are rated to stretch to less of a degree?

The original hardware was qualified, but our customer wants to change to new hardware due to a field failure.

"Jacquard Loom ideas?My current obsession is to try and build a homemade jacquard loom. If you don't know how they work, look then up. They are the most amazing mechanical devices ever devised.

My only hurdle is that I want to weave using an arduino (or whatever) and the way it works is each thread runs through a metal loop that you lift up and down depending on the pattern. In the original looms this was controlled by punch cards (and in fact is what punch cards were invented for) but I want to control them via microcontroller. The obvious and most strait forward solution is to just attach each one to a solenoid...

But, I'd need a solenoid for every thread. The cheapest solenoids on the market are $1.50 or more and even a simple scarf has 60+ threads so that seems a bit silly. If I finish this I want to be able to publish the plans for others and making a few hundred dollars in solenoids a requirement makes this something other than a fun project.

In other projects I've seen, people have had a stepper motor move across the entire machine and set each thread individually prior to the next cycle, then use one large solenoid to move all the threads ""turned on"" for that cycle. But that's incredibly slow.

Has anyone seen any mechanisms that might help be reduce the cost and complexity of such a mechanism? Cheap alternatives to solenoids? Just looking for ideas. Thanks!",engineering,t3_d5mr60

"I'm brainstorming ideas on how to improve on the concepts in the Light L16. One is a periscope based zoom and softened xenon flash. What ideas do you have?I do artistic photography and study the technical side during my free time. I researched the Light L16 and other examples that use multiple lens and sensor combos. I also researched ideas on smartphones with optical zoom that are thin.

The problem with the Light L16 is that there is no optical zoom. The ""zoom"" works by cropping and is destructive to the end product. It changes arrays for different focal lengths. The smartphone maker Asus made one that uses a periscope based continuous optical zoom to keep it thin.

I taught myself how a periscope works. In this device, it will have one rear side element as usual then 45 degree angle mirrors/prisms to direct the lights through a motor controlled zoom lens with an adjustable iris, then another 45 degree redirect to the sensor. If a good idea, an element to concentrate the light onto the small sensor may be used (focal reducer). I'm concerned the overlap may not stay the same without a solution. Would using mirrors/prisms be a solution to this? At an optical level, I would like to have the array to deliver an iris opening and design that delivers the same depth of field as f/2.8-f/16 on full frame 35mm DSLRs. The iris opening should be continuously adjustable. The array needs optical stabilization, parfocal zoom, and the ability to adjust focal length during video without a counter adjustment as a side effect.

For the built in xenon flash, it will pass through a diffuser to soften the flash and help prevent red eye. Red eye is caused by eyes reflecting red and absorbing other colors. What material is best for this diffuser that will be built in?

I have a need for a magnet that can pull 60lbs across its surface, and would like the ability to turn it on and off (unplug it).  I am looking for some guidance on what to use as the core, gauge of wire, number of winds, etc, and how to deal with the power source.",engineering,t3_d4qsyk
"Environmentally friendly plastic options?Hey guys,

Long story short I'm a product development engineer at a medical device facility that mostly makes mass produced plastic devices.

I love that I'm making things that save lives but HATE that I'm contributing to the plastic epidemic that seems to be a ticking time bomb for the planet.  I'm looking for any suggestions or advice on possible alternative materials.

We primarily use HIPS and PETG (injection molded and thermo formed, respectively) with a small mix of ABS and acrylic.  I've explored PLA but it seems brutal to manufacture.  Very few other options seem to exist that are sterilizible.

The flowchart hinted at that, too...

---

I am currently working on a simulator project that is split across several different subprojects with members from various other disciplines (mostly electrical and mechanical).  Right now, I'm pretty much the only software guy on the team.  People come and go from this project all the time.


At this time, we're doing development in MATLAB, Simulink, and C++ via Visual Studio.  All of these projects are maintained in a single branch in a single Git repository.  We're tracking issues and work via Jira.


Thanks to a lot of trial and error over the years, I've got a decent amount of experience in what works and what doesn't when it comes to keeping a project maintainable in the long run.  Standard practices, common understanding of the tools, general procedures to follow, et cetera all seem to help (if they're followed, at least).


The problem I'm having is that our current way of doing things... well... leaves a lot to be desired.  We have processes and procedures for doing things, and no one has a problem following them.  However, whenever someone new joins the project, it'll usually take a month or more just to figure out where to even begin.  Like I said, we've got six individual projects sharing a single branch (master) in a single Git repository.  If two people change the same Simulink model, the procedure now is just fetch, rebase, and hope the models are close enough to each other.  One person's change can and often does remove someone else's work in progress.


All that being said, I have tried to talk with my team about fixing it.  Everyone on the team just follows what the project manager says, even though they have the same problems I have.  I try bringing up my suggestions to the project manager, his standard reply is that ""many of our contributors are not professional software developers,"" as though they are incapable of doing anything that is generally associated with software development.  Yet at the same time, this whole thing is being done with Agile/Scrum methodologies with the goal of producing simulator SOFTWARE.

So that brings me to the questions I have,

* How can I try to get this project onboard with doing things a little better?

* Am I wrong to think that a software project should be maintained like a software project?

* Is there a magic combination of words that I can say to get my PM to handle software like the rest of the company does?  I mean even the ""non-software engineers"" on the team are frustrated with how we're doing this.

* Is there something about basic software design and version control which makes them impossible to understand unless you've been doing that for years?

Hopefully, I'm not coming across as arrogant or rude or something bad like that.  I just want things to be better than they are, and I don't really know how to do that.

Lastly, I greatly appreciate everyone who took the time to read this whole mess of a post.


----


Some updates based on the original post:

* Regarding the MATLAB/Simulink, I had someone bring up [a few points](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/d3vcl6/-/f05enw1) on my original post.  Basic summary of my response is that, while *I* know ways use MATLAB and such with proper version control and testing, getting those integrated with our current process is one of the many things I cannot seem to convey.

* Regarding the PM only understanding cost and schedule, I was hoping that since he is also one of the developers (and has a software development background) that he would understand where I'm coming from.

As I was typing this up again, I had a possible epiphany.

"California Exempts Engineers From Gig Economy LawAB 5 would prohibit companies from using ""independent contractors"" instead of hiring employees (who must be paid wages, benefits, etc.) if the workers are performing duties that are the same as the company's core business.   
  
Example: a car wash company cannot, under AB 5, hire independent contractors, who are not on the payroll, to wash cars. They must be hired as employees.  If the car wash company wants to hire a landscaper, he or she may be an independent contractor, because landscaping is not part of the car wash company's core business activity.
  
The AB 5 bill, now on the governor's desk for signature, contains an exemption for engineers.  This means that a civil engineering firm has the option of hiring a civil engineer either as a new employee or as an independent contractor (to do a specific task).

"Engineering a better bed to sleep inHello,

As someone with a minor in physics, I believe there is more we could do with a bed.  A flat mattress bed lets you lay sideways or on your back.  All your weight is felt.

In a waterbed, if you sleep on the railing and between the frame and cushion, some of your weight is suspended and does not stress you as you sleep.  Your arm and leg are laid horizontally on the frame cushion, losing maybe 20% of your weight there alone.  With your other leg and torso suspended where the frame touches the end of the bed bladder, you also do not have your full weight pressing downward.  When I slept on a water bed, I could get by sleeping three hours less and being very refreshed and alert.

My theory is that the more of the weight you can suspend in a bed without it all pressuring your back or side, you will get enhanced rest.

What contraption you'd have to make to mimic a waterbed, but without water and better, it is hard to say.  That's why I posted it here.

As an engineer entering FEA, it just seemed to be a rule of thumb, but I'd like to understand how it became a rule of thumb? What is it about NASTRAN that FEA engineers prefer over ABAQUS, and vice versa?",engineering,t3_d2d6vu

"Is there software that can make accurate measurements/drawings of objects in 2D from a regular picture?So I work in sealing solutions, and one of the main problems we encounter are reverse engineering gaskets. I don't mean copy-catting or some such nonsense- I mean a customer needs a gasket replacement from a flange that might be 20 years old. There is no drawing, no pictures, no reference- just the gasket itself as a sample. We then have to take the sample and reverse engineer it. This takes a considerable amount of time. The main problem is that simply taking a picture and then scaling it in AutoCAD doesn't work very well- even if you scale the image to a set of points, while they may be accurate (for our needs, +/- 10-15 thousandths, less if possible), they often are only accurate at your reference point- so by the time you're 12 inches away, you're an entire .250"" or more off. 

We can iterate and work with this, and we do. Thing is, I just have to believe there is some software out there that will either-

A) give us dimensions/geometry for complex shapes 
B)give us a file/dxf that can be imported right into AutoCAD

C) something else that could be helpful that I'm not thinking of 

This would save several man hours per large, complicated gasket- and maybe most crucialy- prevent us from actually needing the sample to be shipped or driven all the way to our location. They could be states away and we could produce a drawing and gasket for them asap. 

Any input would be greatly appreciated!",engineering,t3_d28g28
"Bearing designHey all, I am trying to design a built in bearing ( I know, reinventing the wheel). The main bearing body is two concentric tubes roughly 6"" long with about .500"" overlap axially. I had planned on grooving the ID and OD, each at radius, then drilling a hole through axially, splitting the ball bearing diameter between od and id, sliding in the balls and hopefully the balls dont line up and fall out. 

The second option is to again, groove a race id/od, but add a threaded collar to the od of the inner tube.   I would push the tubes together, drop the balls in, then put the collar on and tighten down to hold the bearing in place. 

I am leaning towards the second option because it should be more secure. 

The main issues I am worrying is not having a cage to keep the balls spaced correctly, and overall functionality. I have decided to do it this way because it uses off the shelf tubing and ball bearings. I have a lathe to turn the parts. These tubes won't be spinning faster than 2rpm, and I am also concerned I may need to opt for needles rather than balls for axial loading. The second reason I have decided not to use actual bearing is the sizing. Right now, there will be 6 tubes stacked concentric, all need their own bearing between. The largest diameter I am using for this proof of concept is 1.5"", so finding 6, thin wall(.125"" or .250"") at the id and od that I needed was difficult. The final design is going to be around 6"" diameter, and unsurprisingly, 6"" bearings cost a fortune. It has just been a mess finding tubing sizes that match bearing sizes that won't end up costing $6k in parts.",engineering,t3_d28hmo

[Falcon 9 First Stage Simulator](https://i.redd.it/umr07m1o9el31.png)

This application uses engineering equations to simulate the behavior, efforts and performance, in addition to controlling the power and trajectory, of the first stage of a Falcon 9 (SpaceX) rocket. It has different panels for loading structural information, performance characteristics of engines, throttle control curves and vehicle inclination, etc.

The main panel shows the progress of the simulation in real-time, and a 3D model in an OpenGL window, all this, initially synchronized with a real video of the launch that allows comparing speeds and altitudes at each moment to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation. Finally, once the simulation is completed, it is possible to download all the information in an Excel file to make evaluation graphs. All parameters of the application (structural, engine and control) are fully customizable, so you can configure and simulate every mission you want and compare the results in real-time with the real video.

The application is still being developed, therefore, the experience includes the launching stage and it goes on up to the separation of the second stage. This application is intended only for educational purposes and can be freely distributed. I am not affiliated with SpaceX in any way, shape or form.

"Advice for new engineers from a guy who's been in it for 5 yearsThe 5 year mark is the point where you typically are no longer ""cutting your teeth"" and may start to get legitimate interest from recruiters and have had some solid projects under your belt. I used to wonder if I'd ever reach that point. Here is some advice for any one just starting after I've been in it for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Your first job might not be the best fit, but is necessary to get your career off the ground. Don't be afraid to take a job that is not glamorous. Many people move on from their first job. Soak in as much as you can and get a feel for what you would want out of your engineering career.
2. Most engineering jobs have a reasonable pay attached to them and you may have some extra scratch laying around. Figure out how you want to manage your money early. Try to live within your means even though it might feel like you have gone up a tax bracket. Don't get too deep into vices.
3. Engineering can be a very fulfilling career, but not all aspects of engineering is glamorous work. You will have days that are just another day at the office, and have days you might not be doing any engineering at all. This is the reality they don't tell you in engineering school.
4. If you feel overwhelmed, that's okay. That happens to everyone at some point. Just stick with it, figure out your deficits, adapt, and improve. Skills like time management, negotiation, and so on are valuable and this may be the first time you've had a job where you have had to do these things. 
5. If your boss says you're doing well at your job, you're doing well at your job. 
6. There are jerks and dummies at every job, in every line of work. People will try and challenge you. Some people will try and pull you down. Figure out if you want to stay in that environment. Try not to let it get to you.
7. You may find out you want to be in a part of the business that does not have a lot of raw engineering in it. That's okay. 
8. Treat everyone with respect and don't say anything you might regret in the future. The world is small. You may not see this now, but as you go on in your career, an act of good will may help a lot in the future. 
9. Regardless of where you are or where you've came from, you're still fresh and you might not have credibility with your engineering ideas just yet. Just do a good job and you will gain that rapport with people.
10. Stick your neck out where it matters, but don't burn the candle at both ends. Burnout can happen quickly when you see all these people on social media doing everything in the world and you're just making paperclips. You'll find a place where your voice matters and you can make waves. Don't rush to do this so early. 
11. Be mindful with your mental health. Find a hobby that tickles whatever itch you don't get at your day job that you are looking to get in to. Want to do more design? Start making things. Get in to your local business circle. Read. Go hiking. These are all healthy. 
12. Don't spend too much money on beer. Seriously.",engineering,t3_d0zbz4

"Is it worth it to automate consulting in Engineering?Hello Engineering Community! I have a question for you all. Specifically, this question pertains to Civil Engineers in the consulting world, but I guess it could apply to other engineering fields. So my question is: Is it worth it to automate consulting in Engineering? 

To preface this question, let me explain why it came to mind. I work for a small Civil Engineering consulting firm (a little over 100 people) and a lot of the work we do is consulting for city and other small scale government infrastructure. My firm has recently been working on a lot of wastewater treatment projects where we upgrade systems that have become outdated and are not performing for growing populations. I've been working on quite a few facility plans with tight budgets, and it seems that there is simply not enough time to explore options for their upgrades due to budge constraints. Facility workers also have to balance incredible amounts of pros and cons for these upgrades before they make a decision. Some pros and cons include relevant systems due to city size, installation costs, operational costs, longevity of the system, environmental impacts, experience required for operation, etc. To boil down these options, I think it would be beneficial to use a program or script that runs calculations based on the WWTP's current needs, expected growth, and budget constraints to pump out the most economical and feasible options for upgrade. Do you guys think that this is worth the time and effort?

Obviously there would be a few kinks in this system such as updating it for new technology, but this could potentially just build on itself. I think this might be a good system for choosing stormwater BMPs too, but it has the potential for way more applications. What are your thoughts and concerns with automating these type of decisions? If you think that this is a good idea, what programs (such as python) would be best for performing something like this?

"A multi-disciplinary open-design project to combat climate changeDisclaimer: I'm not interested in debating the science of climate change. If you don't believe in climate change please argue it elsewhere. Thanks!

I have an idea for combating climate change, but it involves multiple engineering disciplines which puts most of the feasibility assessment of my idea outside of my expertise. I know myself well enough to know that I'm not cut-out to be an entrepreneur or leader of any sort. My hope is that posting the idea here might inspire some of my fellow engineers to work together on a solution.

TL;DR: I want to build a scalable, modular system that uses clean energy to extract CO2 from the ocean and combine it with H2 (also from the ocean) to produce syngas (a mixture of CO and H2) and/or methanol. People can invest in production capacity and, once the system grows large enough; it will become economically feasible to directly sequester some of the recaptured CO2 rather than using it to synthesize fuel. Until that point, the fuel will be carbon-neutral because it will be synthesized from an equal amount of carbon pulled out of the atmosphere.

More specifically, I envision the system as a fleet of robotic tug-boats (possibly powered by kite-sails) that tug arrays of spherical, concentrating-photovoltaic (CPV) ""pods"" around the ocean. The fleet can avoid weather systems and migrate with the seasons to optimize sunlight (weighed against the energy cost of maneuvering of-course), and store the energy they collect in chemical form by synthesizing hydrocarbons from CO2 and H2 extracted from the seawater. Those hydrocarbons are periodically collected and sold as fuels or industrial feedstocks.

The pods use various mechanisms like reaction wheels and/or ballast systems to track the sun and a fresnel lens to concentrate light onto small, efficient, PV cells. They are passively cooled by the ocean water and their frame and solar tracking mechanics should be much cheaper and less complex than land-based CPV because they don't have to withstand high wind loads and can largely be made out of plastic and/or thin aluminum (perhaps getting some of their strength from pressurization like [soda cans](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw)). If a powerful weather system is unavoidable, it may be possible to partially submerge the pods, though I'm not sure how useful that will be in protecting them. My intuition says that a pod surrounded by water has less chance of suffering hard impacts than if it's surrounded by air.

The pods are designed with mass production in mind. Any part of the system that lends itself to economies of mass production should be integrated into the pods if feasible. Systems that lend themselves more to economies of physical scale will be integrated onto the tug platform. I assume most chemical processing processes (like the [Fischer-Tropsch process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer%E2%80%93Tropsch_process)) will fall in the latter category because many of them require high temperatures to operate and the cube-square law favors one big system over many little systems in that case.

I imagine the harnessing system as a series of interlocked flexible hoola-hoops that are slightly smaller that the diameter of the pods so a pod's buoyancy keeps it from getting out from under the harness and the smaller size of the harness prevents the pods from escaping through the top. The hoops might also function as a sort-of windshield wiper that scrapes biofilm and other obstructions off the surface of the pod as the pod rotates to either track the sun and/or as a cleaning procedure. The harnessing system will carry electricity, data, and possibly extracted gasses from the pods to the tug boat.

Some of the chemical processes may scale better with surface-area than volume, so it may make sense to distribute such processes among the pods. The CO2 capture system I have in mind is based on [electrodialysis research published by Xerox a few years ago](https://bit.ly/2m5fF65).

I don't know how big each pod will be. I imagine them as a meter or less in radius, but that's an optimization problem I haven't tackled yet. It may be better to make them very small and light so that they don't damage each other in rough seas and to ease their mass production, or it may be better to make them so large that the disturbance caused by ocean waves is negligible to tracking the sun (which may make them very large, indeed).

I've watched several companies over the years like NanoSolar who promised 50 cents/watt solar cells \*once they reach large scale production\* and ITM power who promised $50/Kw electrolysis and H2 fuel cells \*once they reach large scale production\* only to never achieve large scale production for many reasons, but one is that they needed to solve the problem of generating demand for their products to reach large scale production while not being able to offer the low prices that large-scale production affords.

With this concept, we don't have to sell the hardware to anybody. We just ramp up to mass scale as fast as possible and sell the end product, syngas and methanol directly to the market. China is starving for affordable syngas. Methanol can be converted to many different fuels via exothermic processes or it can be burned directly. Peak oil is behind us. Peak natural gas is expected to occur next year. There's still lots of carbohydrate-fuel hungry industry and infrastructure out there and no alternative in sight for the Aerospace industry. If we can fill that demand with carbon-neutral fuel, we can alleviate some of the transition pains of moving away from fossil-fuels, then, as demand dies down, we turn our armada's capacity increasingly towards permanent sequestration and restoring CO2 levels to safe margins (below 350 ppm).

Extra Credit:I believe it may be possible to exploit the [chromatic aberration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration) caused by the fresnel lens to achieve efficiency comparable to or better than traditional multi-junction cells at a fraction of the cost. Rather than using complex semiconductor manufacturing processes layer substances with different band-gaps but similar lattice constants, it may be possible to use the fact that the optical concentrating element focuses light of differing wavelengths at different focal points to achieve similar results with independently manufactured bulk semiconductors of differing band-gaps. Instead of laying the PV cell flat, perpendicular to the incident light, we stack insulated rings of semiconductors with increasing band-gaps (possibly made of quantum dots?) in a thin, needle-like structure such that each wavelength's focal point aligns with a semiconductor suited to efficiently absorb said wavelength. (I'll try to include diagrams when I get the chance).

I know there are lots of ways this idea might not pan out and I know that the ocean is a super harsh environment, but we're engineers! Our job is to solve difficult problems! I hope some of you at least enjoy mulling over the concept. There's plenty in this proposal that could change dramatically. It doesn't need to be sea-faring or even solar powered, it could just be driven by nuclear reactors on the coast. I believe the Robotic Solar Armada is pretty compelling, but again, I only know electrical engineering. I can't possibly search a meaningful portion of the whole solution space on my own!

"How do you deal with anxiety and mental stress?Hey all,

I've been a P.Eng for about 3 years now (of which, 2 years I was unemployed), and it has only been recently (since June) that I've started to sign drawings.  With that added responsibility, I've also realized that I have also adopted quite a bit of stress and anxiety related to that.  I do suffer from depression and generalized anxiety, which I have been addressing with medication and sessions with a psychologist.   

I am currently in that phase of my primary project where I provide construction support in addition to the detailed design.

(This is one of those thoughts that, once you have it, it's difficult to let go until you actually understand what's going on. Bear with me, I think it's interesting material.)

Implants are ""filled"" with either saline solution or a silicone gel.

1) How are saline-filled implants... well, filled? Is the fluid in a bag that the silicone is then overmolded around? 

2) Is the silicone ""gel"" a different viscosity than water?

3) What other fluids are used for similar applications, and in their applications are they manufactured the same way? Is there a library of body-safe fluids of varying viscosities for these applications?

Or would I take the load and multiply that by the height from the point on the crank arm where the load is applied to the base to find the moment?

To put it simply I need to trace the beam, bouncing from two mirrors or two prisms, I need to be able to simulate rotation of those mirrors/prisms and modify their surface (flatness), and see how these things influence angle of deviation at the end.Can anyone suggest me software, that would be best to use?

"Help with photointerrupter optical sensor wiringHi all,

I should preface this with I am not any kind of electronics engineer, I am just tasked with assembling a test rig. I am working on a project that uses a photointerrupter and a slotted disc to give an RPM reading of a roller. Previously we used [Honeywell HOA6990-T51 sensors](https://uk.farnell.com/honeywell/hoa6990-t51/opto-switch-slotted/dp/1136079) sending a signal to a National instruments USB-6211 hub. These sensors seem to be discontinued now, and a colleague of mine purchased these [Honeywell HOA0875-T51 sensors](https://uk.farnell.com/honeywell/hoa0875-t51/optic-sensor-sw-transmissive/dp/1838924) as the electrical 
characteristics seem the same. 


Here comes the question, as the original sensor was leaded with 5 wires coming off, but the new one only has 4 and I need to check if i have it right how to wire it. The 6990 was connected to the hub as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

Red, Anode - Connected to +5V through a series 470 ohm resistor

Black, Cathode - Connected to ground

Green, Detector GND - Connected to ground

Blue, Detector VCC - Connected to +5V

White, Detector signal out - Connected to signal input

&amp;nbsp;

As the new sensor only has Anode, Cathode, Emitter and Collector I assumed there is a shared ground and it's to be wired as follows:

&amp;nbsp;

A - +5V through series 470 ohm resistor

K - GND

E - +5V

C - Signal input

&amp;nbsp;

Is this correct? I'm slightly out of my depth here.

Many thanks

"PE stamping compensationSo a few years ago I took it upon myself to get my PE, something I always wanted to do/have. Generally speaking in my industry, most things just require a competent person, and most of what I make is for internal use. I my official title is “Corporate Mining Engineer”but I was hired prior to getting my PE and it’s not considered a requirement for my position. 

My company paid for a review coarse and gave me the day off for the test.  They have also continued to pay for the CE credits I need to stay certified. They did not bump my salary or offer me any additional compensation when I passed and got certified. 

Recently a I have been asked to review and stamp a few permit submits, nothing fancy just double checking that everything is correct. I have also been doing some designs that may required to be stamped as well, all within my competency but high level work.  

My question is should I be asking for something else from my company? Is it ok to be stamping things with no insurance and no compensation?

EDIT #1- So I ended up on a phone call with the VP of Legal and the Risk Manager. I explained the types of things I was being asked to review, low risk permit applications, and that I just wanted to make sure I was covered. Their explanation was that I am covered by my company for any activity that is part of my job. The example was ‘..if a employee has a wreck in a company truck, while on the way to a job, he is 100% covered by us”

So we went around and agreed that since I was not hired as a PE, and stamping things is not part of my job description, they see how I’m concerned. So the remedy is that I will be requesting HR to formally add this type of work to my job description, so I’m fully covered in case of litigation over a submittal. 

On the back end, of this goes through, i plan to then go to my manager and request my compensation be increased to reflect the increase in responsibility. See what happens!?!",engineering,t3_cwld3o
"Failure criteria of composite materialsI am a PhD student from Germany, working on composite materials. I try to write something about the state of the art of composite failure mechanisms and criteria. As far as I read the literature, the failure criteria by Alfred Puck is quite versatile and distinguishes between fibre failure and matrix failure. However, I find it difficult to find an overview or comparison of the standard failure criteria. I do understand the differences between them  (I got information on the criteria of Tsai-Hill, Tsai-Wu and Hashin), but feel like I am not sure about which one is the “best” criteria for modern calculation of composite failure. For my thesis, the most important is the matrix failure and for this case, the Puck criteria seems to be best, but as I haven’t found any literature that says “well yeah, Puck is THE criteria” I don’t want to write that this should be used.

"Hydrovac concrete pilesHey structural engineers,

I am in the midst of a discussion with some engineers in my office, and contractors in the field, about the effects of hydrovac excavations on concrete skin friction piles.  We have no geotechnical report, nor classic civil engineer for guidance.

I am of the thinking that the hydrovac procedure compromises the soil wall, thus reducing the effective skin friction of the pile.  However I also understand the argument that it would actually aid the skin friction resistance, as the soil wall within the hole can be considered 'rougher' than if it were traditionally drilled.

Excavation depth would be roughly 15', and we already assume the upper 4' to 6' does not provide any capacity.

So, I am a Civil PE in California interested in doing some civil/structural design and consulting work in addition to my full time job. I've been offered some pretty interesting projects that, in which, in my opinion, I would benefit by protecting my assets by forming an LLC or some type of corporation. The projects I am being offered are multi-level buildings that have a lot (to me) of money involved for development. 

I looked into forming an LLC but according to the California Business &amp; Professions Code engineering services cannot be provided under an LLC (it doesn't explicitly state this, rather LLC is omitted). I've talked to a laywer about this and they mentioned its true, you cannot practice engineering under an LLC in California. So, what would type of entity would I need to create since I believe a sole proprietor would be too vulnerable to practice this type of engineering? He said the answer would require us sitting and discussing this for a few sessions and a total of $3,000. This fee also include setting up all of the initial contract templates and any type of legal protection that would be required up front. I still need to talk to a few more lawyers and am not looking for legal advice.

Rather, I just want to know what type of business entities ya'll are using and how often you practice.

"How to create a stable pressurize environment without spending a lot?Hello r/engineering ! I hope I'm not posting this in the wrong sub.

Right now my job need me to figure out is it possible to create a stable and precise environment of 

1. at least 1.5 liters of 97°C aqueous solution (let's say, sodium chloride)

2. roughly 2 atm (specifically 15 psi more than outside environment) 

3. maintain in this state for at least a couple days

I guess i could always ask a lab instrument manufacturer to make a customized device but that will likely to cost a bit.

I've done some ideal gas calculation, if I simply heat up the solution to 97°C in a airtight vessel I'll get a roughly 2.1 atm environment. But then I will have to figure out how to adjust the pressure. Right now my solution will probably be getting a pressure reactor with a PID controlled heating device and make something like a system consists of a regulator valve and a gas cylinder connect to the vessel in case the pressure level change. 

My question is: Will a setup like this achieve my goal? Will the pressure adjustment setup affect the temperature of the solution or am I worrying too much? Is there a way to make the vessel adjust the pressure on its own so it can maintain itself for a period of time? Also is there an easier way to do this?

This is probably a weird and really specific problem but I'll be grateful if anyone can help me with this.",engineering,t3_cwlzkg
"what is the pressure effect of co-mingling slipstream liquid flow with a lower-pressure main branch?We've been talking about a fluid problem at work here, I'm hoping someone with more specific experience in fluid dynamics can shed some light on the subject.

The setup is this:  

We're taking a small slipstream from a mainline and pumping it to run through some instruments and commingling with the original piping.

The problem:

The pump is positive-displacement.  If taken at face-value, the discharge head identified on the curve at our operating flow rate will be significantly higher than the discharge piping losses to the point where the slipstream commingles with the main piping.  We're having a hard time wrapping our heads around what will happen to this fluid, will it:

* Pressure up inside the pump and as soon as it is exposed to the pump discharge pressure will the volume slightly expand until the volumetric flowrate/discharge pressure meet an equilibrium with downstream hydraulic frictional losses?  

or will it 

* Propagate a higher pressure downstream of the pump discharge, increasing the pressure in the slipstream piping?  

If the roles were reversed and we were pumping the mainline flow instead of the slipstream I'd say ""that slipstream will never re-integrate with the mainline since it doesn't have enough pressure to commingle"" but given that in our case the volumetric flow rate of the pressurised slipstream is significantly lower than the main piping, I expect that it will be able to commingle and will have a minor effect on the downstream pressure.  I'm curious if anyone knows exactly how this works and the principles at play?  What is the tipping point where a slipstreams excessive flow rate would back-out mainline flow at the commingle point?  

It's been a long day, I don't know if I've explained that well, but hopefully somebody is picking up what I'm putting down and can shine some expertise on this.

"Question about Peltier devices (TECs)I'm a mechanical engineer and was torn between r/engineers and r/askengineers per the flowchart so I'll try here first. My apologies if I missed the mark!

Someone please verify my logic here:

I have 2 identical Peltier devices (TEC) and two completely independent power supplies for them. Assuming the end goal is lowest cold side temperature, is it better to set them up in series/parallel or doesn’t it matter?

Since they each have a dedicated power supply, I’m talking about mechanically, not electrically. Do I stack them or mount them side by side on a common cold plate?

My line of thinking is that a stacked (series) arrangement allows a greater “delta T” across the junction. A parallel arrangement would have more contact area, but I’m not concerned with transient response at all, just steady-state cold temperature.

Another line of thinking is that each TEC is simply an amount of heat transfer, in Watts. So if you have 2 of them in each scenario, you have the same number of Watts being extracted from the cold plate. In this line of reasoning it seems like it wouldn’t matter how I arranged them?

Any input would be appreciated. You’d think I could solve this with simple heat transfer equations but I’m apparently off my game today…

I think my question is a general one that wouldn’t need specifics, but just in case I’m mistaken, my TEC’s are [TEC1-12706](http://www.thermonamic.com/TEC1-12706-English.PDF) and my power supplies are good for 12V and 5A each.

I ended up with an accident. One of my pieces is shorter now, significantly. So I'm thinking of making it an uneven X design. So the table will only be connected to the top left part of the X on one side and maintaining our current perspective, the top right of the X on the other end, with the crossing part of both x's being shortened.  Top is \~30 inches/8lbs. 

  

In a way like each 'leg' is kind of cantilever in a way but not truly since the legs would be supporting both side of the table. If the top left, top right, bottom left, and bottom right were labeled a, b, c, d respectively, the supports would be at A and D or B and C. with and X at each end but only one leg of the X contacting the table top, the other being shorter.

The reducers consist of a 6” to 4” metal reducer and a 3” to 1.5” pvc reducer, which fits quite nicely in the 4” reducer/adapter. 

With the fan not connected to the reducers, I feel full,240 CFM on the outlet. With the 6” to 4” reducer connected to the fan, I feel less CFM on the outlet and some coming out the inlet of the fan. With both reducers attached, the outlet is close to 0 and all air flow seems to be exiting out the inlet of the fan.

Is it because I’m pulling from atmosphere, as opposed to a closed piping section?
Why is air pushing back through the fan? 
How can this be avoided?
