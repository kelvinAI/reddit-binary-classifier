"My vaccinated child caught pertussis, why? My 3 year old unfortunately has been diagnosed with pertussis. I followed all the recommended vaccine schedule and got my tdap during pregnancy. The child who probably gave it to her at school was also vaccinated. I live in a pertussis hot spot (southern California).

I have read some articles about how the pertussis vaccine isn't as effective as it used to be. How are vaccinated kids catching this and is there anything else that can be done to prevent this? Thanks.

Edit: Someone mentioned my post could cause people to not vaccinate. Actually my situation is an example of needing herd immunity. I happen to live in a low vaccination region where we have more outbreaks than normal.",AskDocs,t3_dl2jgu

"20F medical mystery. Healthy as a kid, suddenly disabled at 18. White female age 20, 5'1, 150 pounds and dropping rapidly due to inability to eat without pain. 

Heres a summary of everything going on and the tests we've done. 

I was a healthy child. The symptoms started around age12 but became severe at 16. I started using a cane at 17. I am now 20 and completely reliant on a walker or wheelchair. heres what we know:

I fit the criteria for hypermobile ehlers danlos syndrome and am getting a formal diagnosis. Extreme joint pain and joint hypermobility. Joint instability keeps me from balancing because of my ankles and knees. atrophic scarring all over my body. Among other things. 

Debilitating chronic fatigue. Autonomic testing was normal. No cardiac problems except sinus tachycardia but ive been told thats ""normal"" and not treatable. 

All blood tests have been fine except low iron saturation- but not dangerously low. Ive since started eating meat again.

I have had unexplained digestive issues my entire life that are unexplained even after colonoscopy/upper endoscopy. I have a rare immune disorder eosinophilic esophagitis thst causes throat symptoms but nothing explains my lower gi symptoms. Im on an elimination diet with improvement after eliminating soy and dairy but not total improvement.  Low fodmap diet didnt help. Low fat/fat free diet didnt help. Vegetarianism didn't help. 

Im having what i can best describe as partial seizures thst last from 2 minutes to 2 hours triggered by strobe lights and exersize. My eeg was clear. Head Mri was clear. Spinal xray was clear. Symptoms are getting worse. The ER says they cant help me even when im having a complex partial seizure (thats how they described it) lasting 45 minutes. They just sent me home.

I am losing the ability to play guitar because my fine motor skills are deteriorating. 

Ive never has a drug problem. Dont smoke. Dont drink. I eat too little and am losing weight purely because it hurts to eat. I had gained a little weight (was 165 a few months ago) due to a briefly underactive thyroid but that sorted itself out after a few months.  My thyroid is functioning normally.


I HAD signifigant mental health problems as a teen and an eating disorder because i was abused as a child.  I have recovered, have no self harm behaviors, did extensive therapies and am doing very well. These cant be blamed on my mental health despite very rude doctors insisting its all in my head. Im nearly bedridden. 

Im losing everything. I have been told im makimg it up for attention which is simply not possible. I see a neurologist on the 31st and im terrified hes going to tell me that my seizures are psychogenic qnd send me to another psychiatrist. 

The one thing i wonder about is a suicide attempt at 16. I overdosed on muscle relaxers and was incapacitated for 2 days. They said thev arent sure if ill have any long term problems. So far, i havent. No liver issues. Organs look good. But i wonder about my seizures having a link?

Ive been DISCHARGED from therapy after 7 years because im doing extremely well mentally. My biggest source of turmoil is my deteriorating health. 

If any physician has any suggestions for me, id be so thankful. Ill happily answer any questions to clarify anything.",AskDocs,t3_dlc1f3

"I spend 75% of my day sleeping but never feel rested. For as long as I can remember I’ve had sleep problems, just called insomnia by my doctors. I’d have trouble going to sleep, and it was managed with medication.

Within the past year or so, I’ve had the complete opposite problem. I still take medication for sleep, but I don’t believe that’s what’s causing it (exact same thing when I don’t take my meds). I’m constantly tired, and I never feel rested. I go to bed about 10pm, wake up around 10am-1pm. I’d eat, watch some tv and clean up a bit, and then I feel so tired that I need to sleep again at around 3-5pm. Wake up at around 7pm, eat and mess around, then bed at 10.

I’m at my wits end with this. No matter how long I sleep, I never feel refreshed. I can’t get a job, I can barely function. My family calls me lazy, and honestly sometimes I just don’t want to deal with it anymore.

Same symptoms except that my muscles were twitching, and it felt like someone was poking me with a needle (which only lasted a couple of days and hasn't happened in over 2 weeks). I also started getting headaches all over my head that come and go, but were only lasting for about 20 or so seconds, the muscles twitches were also coming and going and only lasting a few seconds at most, and they were happening everywhere.

"Lactating not pregnant Age: 29
white 
female 
Medications: Zoloft 50mg daily, colonozopam 1mg 3x daily, 81mg aspirin 3x week. 

Hi guys. So, I have had nipple discharge for about 3 months now. The first time it happened, my nipples just started leaking. Since then, discharge has only occurred when breasts are squeezed. I really try not to stimulate the production of what seems so be colostrum, but I get this “feeling” and so every couple weeks or so i check and both breasts are still producing drops of milky/clear discharge, though more so from my right breast. The feeling is not good or bad, more so a weird sensation or feeling of pressure. More discharge comes from my right breast. 

I am not pregnant. 
I am on Zoloft and know ssris may cause lactation however I have been on Zoloft (on and off a couple times but solidly on for the last 3 years) for about 9 years and never experienced this. 
I did quit progesterone only birth control about 4.5 months ago but, again, I have stopped both combination and progesterone only birth control before, many times, without this side effect. 

Doctor tested blood for abnormal thyroid levels and increased prolactin levels and all labs came back normal. 

I do have a history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis in my family and have had up and down thyroid hormone levels for years and years, but never anything definitive enough for doctors to declare a thyroid issue. 

I do have homozygous factor v Leiden, hence the aspirin prescription however don’t see any reason that would be associated. 

Other recent “symptoms” that probably aren’t relation, but what do I know,  include a recent serious back spasm which has caused lingering tightness near my right scapula up to the right side of my neck, and increased stigmatism for which my eyeglasses prescription was adjusted. But I understand I’m getting older and eyesight changes. 

Where do I go from here? My doc wants the “wait and see” method however I already knew I had stopped birth control which could be a contributing factor and thus did wait to see her for months. I have had normal, on time periods since stopping birth control. 

I was pregnant for 7 weeks over 4 years ago. 

I am not around any newborn children that may have stimulated “sympathy” lactation. 

Any suggestions on next steps to take? 

Thanks so much!

"Skin rash on arm turning into large blisters Male, 31 years old, 240 lbs, 6'2, white. No current medications, occasion drinker, no recreational drugs, no known allergies. 

[Photos of the rash/blisters](https://imgur.com/a/XCscEbh) (Note the white milky substance in the first photo is from an anti-fungal medication, not the skin condition) 

[Same Photos on google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xd-fSmKxrH7ZVnZDl0Mh2elBesDM1vZT?usp=sharing)

The issue I am having is I developed a rash on my arm 10 days ago and it has been getting worse and more widespread. The rash started when I woke up one morning and I had eight small bumps clustered together on my right forearm that looked pretty much like mosquito bites. At the time I figured it was a mosquito, spider, or some insect as all the ""bites"" were near each other.

Over the next few days, the bumps started getting larger and the top layer of skin above the rash spots started to blister away. Now 10 days later it has gotten significantly worse. Many smaller bumps have appear and the original ones have become quite large. All of the affected areas are still on my right forearm for now.

Also, when a new blister is about to form it seems to start as small bump filled with a clear liquid. Even just running my fingers over the bump is enough to break the new blister and then it starts to become what you see in the pictures.

For treatment, I have been putting a generic over the counter anti-fungal cream on it and wrapping up the area. I have done this for the last 5 days and I cannot really tell if that is doing anything. 

I do wrestling and come in contact with many other wrestlers, so it is very possible I picked up something from them. Any help identifying this or suggested treatment with this would be great.

Thank you.",AskDocs,t3_dl9d45
"My sister might have REM Sleep Behavior Disorder... what can we do? I think my sister might have REM Sleep Behavior Disorder. Here’s her info:

Age: 25

Sex: Female

Height - 5’4”

Weight - ?

Primary complaint - REM Sleep Behavior Disorder

Medication - Adderall

Duration - Off and on for the past few years, increasing in severity these past few months

So, I’m pretty sure my sister has REM Sleep Behavior Disorder. Due to unfortunate living circumstances, she shares a bed with our mother. She’s always had a bit of a strange issue where she’ll start screaming in her sleep, like she’s having a nightmare, but it’s almost impossible to wake her up when it’s happening. 

Recently, she’s started acting out her dreams and it’s starting to become dangerous. She latched on to my mom’s leg the other night and wouldn’t let go. Last night, she started punching at and kicking her. It’s completely unintentional and she has zero recollection of it happening when she wakes up. 

Through some research, I’ve found a potential diagnosis of REM Sleep Behavior Disorder. She’s going to try taking melatonin because it’s a suggested remedy, and if that doesn’t work, the only other suggestion is klonopin. 

My questions are -

Do you think she might have REM Sleep Behavior Disorder? 

If so, my research shows that those with this disorder have a very high chance of developing Parkinson’s... and that terrifies me. I hope she doesn’t have RSBD but I don’t know what else it could be. What do I do?",AskDocs,t3_dlatft

"22m, temporarily lost my eyesight while I was overheated at a concert. Should I be worried? Hey! 22m here – pretty skinny at 6’2” 145lb but it’s never been a health problem. I don’t have any serious medical complications in my past other than one incident where I accidentally took a bite out of a ghost pepper cheese fritter and needed to lie down on the bathroom floor for 20 minutes. Last night I was at a concert with some friends deep in the mosh pit when I started to feel myself overheating and feeling a little sick because it was getting kind of rowdy and I had caught an elbow or two in the gut. Not great for me or anything, but nothing that would cause any long-term complications. 

However, when I started to move back out to the periphery of the venue and ask a security guard for some water to keep cooled off, my vision started to go dark – shapes got blurry, I couldn’t make out faces, I couldn’t perceive any light even though I know there were tons of lights flashing up on stage, and I could only make out a vague shape of really high-contrast stuff – for example, I could tell there were white letters on black when looking at the security guard’s vest, but it almost seemed like a solid bar instead of individual letters since it all sort of bled together. I could make out the vague outline of faces as I was pushing through the crowd to the back of the venue but couldn’t discern any details or even tell where the eyes or the mouth or nose were – it was just sort of an amorphous blob, and I couldn’t make out any details about the bodies attached to those faces. For context on length, it took probably close to 5 minutes from when I lost my vision to when I could see clearly and everything was back to normal again, and that was while hydrating and sitting on a stool.

I’ve got 20/20 vision, never had to wear contacts or glasses before, and I’ve never suffered any loss of vision like that before and even though I’ve gotten a little bit lightheaded at concerts before when jumping around and dancing and getting exhausted like normal, I’ve never lost my ability to see because of it. I also know it wasn’t drugs – I hadn’t drink any alcohol before the concert, didn't take any drugs, and I didn’t drink anything at the show until I got water from the security guy, so I know I didn’t take anything that was spiked (plus from a pragmatic perspective I don’t think most people try to roofie 22 year old men).

"Can my stuffed up sinuses be pressing on my eyeballs messing with my vision? 30 y/o Caucasian male (330 lbs, 6' 4"") with a history of allergies.

So, for the past couple of months my vision has been distorted, where things that are supposed to be square sometimes look like trapezoids.  Sometimes the whole world will also look like it is curved, like the left hand side is sloping to the left and the right hand side is sloping to the right.

This fluctuates though, with some days being a lot worse than others.  I've been to an optometrist and opthamologist who both could not find any physical problems with my eyes.

I went to an ENT doctor who says that I have ""pansinusitis"" and that all of my sinuses are blocked.  Is it possible that these blocked sinuses are pushing on my eyeballs and distorting my vision?  It's not blurry, just distorted.

"What can you tell me about Tropical Spastic Paraperesis, a disease caused by HTLV-I? I don’t want to write too much, I’m just feeling anxious and was wondering if anyone on here can give me some further insight on this condition.

I’m a 19 year old female with swelling in my brain and spine, and the doctors have no idea why. When I was 10 years old I was admitted to the hospital after having a constant fever for almost 2 weeks, and after doing some tests the doctors informed us I had contracted Typhus. I was inpatient for about a week (if I remember correctly), given antibiotics, and we figured all was well and done. A few months later is when I got my first UTI which was causing incontinence that my parents just assumed was a kid thing, something for attention; by the time I saw a urologist and we figured out what was happening the UTI had caused scarring on my kidneys. After this I couldn’t go any longer than a month without having another UTI, and I also began to experience semi-frequent bowel incontinence. The urologist told us I had an underdeveloped bladder, making me prone to accidents. So I had to learn about Poise pads at age 11.

Shortly after 6th grade started my mom would occasionally make comments about my gait. She would ask, “Why do you walk like that? You jut out your hips in a weird way”. I never made a conscious effort to walk a certain way, so I didn’t think a lot about it. By 7th grade I was having a great deal of difficulty keeping my balance while walking, so I always held onto the wall. I found that it was nearly impossible to not drag my feet because my legs were so tired. My mom had brought this up during my routine PCP appointments, though nothing ever came of it.

It was the Halloween of 2014 when my parents snapped and decided that something was, surely, very wrong. After about 20 minutes of trick-or-treating, my legs gave out. I sat on the sidewalk and cried because I knew this wasn’t normal, and my dad was equally as upset. My parents took me to the ER the next day and demanded that I see a doctor who would take my progressive symptoms seriously. I was admitted and in the hospital for three days so they could do “every test possible” (some blood work, x-rays, and an MRI). We met my first neurologist who broke the news: they found nothing wrong with me, therefore, I must have conversion disorder. My parents were elated to find out nothing was PHYSICALLY wrong— meaning I could be cured— but I knew right away that something was very, very wrong. We left with a prescription for Prozac and a list of counselor recommendations.

All throughout 8th grade I continued getting worse, and nothing ever came of the follow up appointments I had with the neurologist. By this point I could not stand back up after falling on the floor, and I needed someone to hold me up as I walked. This neurologist convinced my entire family AND medical team that I was getting worse because I was faking everything, and trying to manipulate people for extra privileges. I was hospitalized in a behavioral institution 4 times due to suicidal ideation and self harm; nobody believed me, and I had to deal with my deterioration all on my own.

At age 14 I got a walker, and by age 15 I had to resort to a wheelchair. It wasn’t until I was 16 that I went in for a routine optometrist appointment and the eye doctor, essentially, saved my life. She saw that there were white spots on each of my optic nerves, which tends to be seen in patients with MS, and she recommended us to an opthamologist who we saw 2 days later. They were baffled by the amount of swelling I had in my eyes, and said I was on the verge of losing my eyesight. This paired with my other neurological symptoms was very telling. The opthamologist told us to get out of corpus as soon as possible for a second opinion, so I was seen by a doctor in another city.

My initial examination with the neurology team was enough to have me admitted. They did a full body MRI which revealed that I had swelling all throughout my brain and spine, presenting as scattered white specks. It was decided that whatever I have was an autoimmune response. After a process of elimination the doctors wanted to treat me for CLIPPERS. I did a 5 day round of steroids, 1000 ml intravenously each day. Then 1000 ml a week for 3 weeks, and finally 1000 ml a month for about 4 months. During this time I was also taking Cellcept orally. I went back for a follow up MRI and they swelling had gotten distinctively worse. We know that I don’t have CLIPPERS because of the spine involvement (which is atypical) and the fact that I am not responsive to steroids. After that, we continued searching for a treatment to reduce the swelling. 

-I was on Cytoxan once a month for 4 months, while also getting IVIG once a week.

-The swelling was still progressing, so we did plasmapheresis followed by 2 doses of Rituximab. 

-Again, the swelling was worse. So they did a brain biopsy to get more insight, and all we were told was that there was an excessive amount of T-cells (which supposed CONFIRMS clippers, somehow?) They decided to have me do yet another 5 day round of steroids, 1000 ml a day, and that showed no improvement. 

-Next I was on Tocilizumab for 5 months which caused a severe outbreak of psoriasis all over my body, while the swelling continued to get worse. I began taking Otezla for the psoriasis and wondered if, maybe, that would do something for the swelling (it didn’t). 

-The current treatment we’re trying out is Gilenya; I had my first dose on 8/23. 

Finally, I was reading an article about conditions that “mimic” MS, and I came across the existence of HTLV-1 and the complications it can cause, like tropical spastic paraparesis. It sounds eerily familiar— a slow progressive disease that can lead to weakness of the legs, incontinence, uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammation in the spinal cord. Key concept seems to be “inflammation”. The doctors have agreed to order blood work for screening for the antibodies, and a positive screening for HTLV would basically confirm my suspicion of TSP. He says it’s quite rare in the US, though they said the same thing about typhus. TSP has no definitive “treatment” which could explain why nothing has worked for me, at all.

"My poop has been green for the past week or so, and I don't know why. Please help. Hey doctors/medical professionals, I need some help. I am 16 years old and a male, weigh roughly 125 lbs, and am 5'5. For the past week or so my poop has been straight up dark green. I know what you're thinking, that I must be eating dyed foods, but I cannot think of anything dyed that I ate before this began. However, it is important to note that I ate cookie cake with colored frosting AFTER the green poop stuff began, but that was days ago. The green poop still happens. It is also very loose and paste-like, but definitely not diarrhea. Accompanied with the green poop has been horrible, doubled over stomach cramps. I think I know what's causing this, which is my on-and-off soy allergy/intolerance. I went off soy a day and a half ago and the cramps have stopped. I have no idea if this correlates, but I might as well give all information. The week I got the green poops, I had been eating a mixture of home-cooked meals from my mom and takeout from restaurants. I don't think I was eating badly, and I'm certainly not eating badly now, but nothing changes. Is this possibly correlated to my allergy/intolerance? Should I see my doctor?

"Am I slowly poisoning myself? Hi,

This is a real concern and not sure where else to get advice.

My SO and I have an insect problem at our apartment (roaches, centipedes - venomous, spiders - unsure if toxic but they are huge, ants, mosquitoes) and we have noticed that using a barrier spray chemical product kills most bugs that crawl, however, we use this barrier spray inside the flat, as in, we mop with it and spray the roof linings, its basically just completely covered in here and this is the kind of product that has a warning to not inhale when using and also says to be used outdoors, which I know is probably reason enough to know this is unhealthy to live with, and we have been using it this way for nearly a year. I am in France so I can barely make out the descriptions and warnings but I cant say that I have noticed direct negative health impacts, I already have asthma, but I wonder if breathing these invisible lingering chemicals, could this possibly be a roundup-type slow poisoning by inhalation, because I doubt this brand has any focus on being 'healthy' and is more focused on its potency and effectiveness.

I wouldn't know if its possible to be tested for poisoning but I am worried that this is far from convenient and more detrimental to the future. We have to use something because my SO is completely freaked out by insects especially spiders, centipedes and basically any creepy crawly.

The name of the product is 'DIGRAIN LAQUE CHOC +' by LODIGROUP just in case you know something about the ingredients and are willing to translate

I had a child in April and a few months ago I began having more severe upper right abdominal pain more often. Sometimes accompanied by vomiting. I had a normal ultrasound of my gallbladder in the past so the next step was a HIDA scan which showed my ejection fraction of my gallbladder at 18% so I had surgery a week later. At first I seemed better after the gallbladder removal, but then last week I began having severe upper right quadrant abdominal pain again accompanied by vomiting.

Luckily I have plenty of zofran still on hand, but that doesn’t help the pain. Also I have an approx 10cm right ovarian cyst that I need to get removed at some point.

"Urinary Problems... Hi all,

\-Overview-

I am a 22 yo caucasian male who has recently started dealing with frequent urination problems.

&amp;#x200B;

\-About me-

I am not on any medications, not allergic to anything (that I know of), and have no previous medical issues. I do not drink coffee regularly. My alcohol intake is minimal (I get drunk on occasion with my friends, occasionally being once a month- never more). I am 6'0"", and an athletic 180 lbs. I am physically active and not excessively stressed. I do not smoke or do any illicit drugs.  I am sexually monogamous. Overall, I am very healthy and this issue is quickly becoming very concerning to me.

In my current situation, urinating does NOT cause pain or discomfort. It does NOT smell fruity or foul and is normally colored. I have NOT had any spells of frequent urination or urination problems in the past.

My girlfriend has irregular cells noted on her cervix, possibly HPV related, not yet confirmed. She is getting her OB check-up in the coming weeks. I have no reason to suspect HPV to be the cause.

My situation gets noticeably worse when sitting and *much noticeably worse* when in a car. Urinating does not relieve my urge to urinate (during the times discussed below).

&amp;#x200B;

\-About my situation-

5 days ago (10/16), I was playing a videogame (Fortnite, for those who care to know) with my buddies, when towards the end of the game (when the game intensifies) I felt the relatively sudden and overwhelming urge to pee. I began to shake my legs to hold it in until the game was finished (about 5 minutes). I then got up, went to the bathroom, and peed a modest amount. I was kinda like 'huh?'. It felt like I was holding back the Hoover Dam but then peed a pretty small amount relative to what I felt. I didn't think much of it then, so I sat back down to continue my night. The same thing happened when I got back to play, however. When I sat down, it felt as though I had to pee again. It started as a mild urge but grew rapidly until it was overwhelming. I went to the bathroom again (about 10 minutes later). This time I let out a trickle (a reasonable amount considering I peed 10 minutes ago, but illogical considering how badly I felt the need to go). This continued throughout the evening but seemed to subside when I went to bed. 

I woke up the next day feeling pretty normal. I took my typical morning pee and thought 'yeah, that was weird last night... whatever... hopefully it doesn't happen again'. For two days, it didn't. But then on 10/19, on my drive home from work (admittedly having 2 cups of coffee at work, which is completely unusual for me, refer to my 'About me' section above) I felt that severe urge to pee. I felt like if I did not shake my legs unusually hard, I would wet myself. I rushed into my apartment, ran to the toilet to pee only a modest amount. That day, my girlfriend and I were going to a craft beer festival (not to drink, she works for a brewery and I sometimes tag along) about an hour away. We left as soon as I got home. While sitting in the car with her, I got that insurmountable urge to pee again. I held it off for 20 minutes but had to ask her to pull over. About 20 minutes after that, we had to stop again. The feeling subsided when I got out of the car. For the entirety of the 8-hour festival, the ride home, and that night were all normal.

Yesterday (10/20), I felt the constant urge to pee starting later in the day. Same story, different day- I feel an incredible urge to urinate, release a small volume without discomfort, but then feel no relief. I did not drink any coffee this day and had regular intercourse and ejaculation.

Today (10/21), I had a class in the afternoon. My morning started with a slight inclination to pee. On my ride into school, this slight inclination grew to the feeling of holding back the Hoover Dam again. During my drag of a 3-hour class, the feelings were variable. On my ride home, I had an immense urge to urinate. When I got home, it returned to a slight inclination to pee.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Additional notes-

My situation is highly variable. As I sit here writing this, I barely feel the need to urinate. However, earlier this evening when eating dinner, I could not sit long enough to eat my Moe's burrito in one sitting (My diet is normally healthy- oops).

My urge to pee is noticeably higher when in the car for some reason. Standing up/walking seems to lower my urge considerably. 

I have an undiagnosed facial tic/twitch where I semi-voluntarily nod my head. Not sure how this would come into play, if at all.

My girlfriend works for a medical office in addition to the brewery and sent my urine sample for some quick on-site testing. No glucose or UTI was noted. This test is helpful as guidance but not conclusive. I am planning on calling a urologist tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I am simply looking for advice to subside my urge to urinate or a possible cause. The last several days have been sub-optimal and annoying, to say the least. I am worried it may be a serious problem, as I am not able to rationalize the infrequency of my symptoms.

Any help is much appreciated! Thank you for your time reading all this just to help- it is appreciated more than you know.

Have a good one,

"My Wife (F33) Had Our First Baby Tuesday - BP Still High - Doc Not Worried But I AM! 33F

5'6""

210 lbs postpartum (235 right before birth; 175 before pregnancy)

White

Asymptomatic, just worried and anxious

Duration: since Tuesday 

Current medications: Lebetalol 400mg 2x/day; Tylenol 3x/day

No drinking, smoking, drugs

**INFO:**

My wife and I had our first baby on Tuesday. During the pregnancy, she had some bad swelling, but her BP stayed normal until the last couple weeks of pregnancy. Even then it was 135/80 normally. Docs said very trace amounts of protein in urine but not enough to even care.

During labor, but before pushing and before the epidural, her blood pressure was climbing. As soon as they gave her the epidural, it came down to a normal number, albeit still over 120/80. No nurses or doctors were worried and even calmed us down a lot.

Postpartum, her blood pressures have ranged from 135/80 to 165/93 at the worst. We only had 1 reading that high. Most were 150/85 give or take a couple points on the diastolic. To be fair, she was WAY worked up after the first high reading. Her BPs at night were way lower when she was calm.

Our OBGYNs were not worried. They started her on Lebetalol 100mg 2x per day and she was taking Motrin too. Moved it to 200mg 2x and then 3x per day on the Lebetalol. No change. Her LFT was a 35 (ref range high was 32). Again, docs were not worried in the slightest, and that made us feel better.

Now 6 days postpartum her BP is still high (151/85) today. I took it again but she was already worked up so it came back higher. We have an appt tomorrow morning - but is she in danger right now? Like, should I call the doc? 

No headaches, no seeing spots, no decrease in urine, no chest pain or abdomen pain, no shortness of breath. Nothing. Her swelling has gone way down too. What is going on here? We're worried about postpartum preeclampsia. But is she going to be okay?

"Anal sex ruined my sleep cant go 3 hours without peeing. Age: 31 Sex: M Height: 5'11 Weight: 175lb 

Hello everyone, about 3 years ago I started having many sexual encounters which involved active (top) anal sex. After a few months I started noticing my urine stream was getting weaker, I couldnt hold my pee for more than 3 hours and started feeling pain in my perennial area. I went to the doctor and after having my prostate milked they detected Enteroccoccus Faecalis, a bacteria commonly found in the large intestine. So they gave me pills and shots along with weekly prostate milkings to check the status of the bacteria colony until eventually it was totally gone. Unfortunately the damage was already done and I still cant go more than 3 hours without peeing and its destroying my quality of life because I havent had a good sleep in 2 years. Doctors say the bacteria may have possibly scarred some nerve tissue which regulates prostate function and it may have to be scrapped with surgery. Doctors have also started to rule out other diseases such as Diabetes insipidus, bladder infection, etc.

Also, regulating intake and frequency of liquids makes absolutely no change whatsoever. In my desperation to get a good nights sleep I have attempted 6 day long dry fasts (no food, no liquid) and I still urinated every 3 hours due to the body metabolizing water from fat in order to keep hydrated.  
Im at a crossroads at the moment because I'm a few steps away from opting to get surgery but I want to rule out any other possibilities before I do. My quality of life is down the drain, cant get any sleep ever and I feel like I have aged more than I should have because of it. Any advice is welcome.

"Question regarding potential STI On saturday night, I (Male in my 20s) made a pretty dumb decision and had unprotected sex with a woman I met at a bar. I plan on getting a full screening panel done here soon, but my understanding is that it can take a few weeks before some things can show up on a test, and potentially months for others. So while I absolutely will get tested, I don't know if it's too early for things to show up yet.

Something that I really would like some more direct feeback on is something that is more immediate. Yesterday morning, once I really started to get my day going, I began to feel some pain in the tip of my penis. I'm not experiencing any burning sensation when I urinate, but I have this dull ache there. My penis looks completely normal right now.

One other thing I would like to add is that I was pretty drunk Saturday night, but despite that, when she was performing oral sex, I thought ""oh God, this really hurts. She is using a ton of teeth"". I thought it would be impolite to say something, so I just sort of shut my eyes hard and just waited for her to kind of stop, which went on for a little while.

As I said earlier, I absolutely will be doing a full panel, but my understanding is that it might be too early for things to show up reliably in the tests.  So is anyone aware of something I could have caught that would start to cause pain less than 10 hours after exposure? I really believe that this is more related to the ""teeth"" situation, but I was hoping to get some input from more knowledgeable professionals.

Hi guys, 

In short, my teeth are a disaster. I’ve been told it’s probably largely the crappy gum tissue (thanks, EDS), but being super fatigued and nauseated also means my oral hygiene is comparatively poor, although of course I do my best. I was told over a year ago that I need to have extractions - all wisdom teeth and a couple of others. 

It’s been nothing but issues since then. My original private dentist referred me to the NHS oral surgery team in my local hospital and I was also switched to home dentistry as I’m 99% housebound and was struggling to even get to my own dentist. The home team is amazing, I love them, I’ve had literally about twelve infections and been on repeated antibiotics; they’ve been nothing but kind and caring.

The hospital is another matter. Because of my general screwed up body, heart valve, every infection eating away at my functional ability and so on, my GP and main consultants think this is really important and urgent for my overall health. I get that it’s not pressing for oral surgeons who have to do cancer and stuff, but they have been totally unwilling to listen to anything *at all* about my other medical conditions, even though they themselves have said they aren’t too familiar with these things all overlapping (last time I had surgery I nearly stopped breathing afterwards in recovery, no one is quite sure why - but I didn’t actually arrest, so really I’m not THAT complex as a patient). 

Now the anaesthetist who was meant to do my surgery in the summer (!) has said he won’t, he isn’t comfortable looking after me. The hospital won’t assign anyone else. So I literally can’t have the procedure - but it doesn’t stop me from needing it and continuing to get worse! We have looked at private care but they don’t have an HDU, so they said it’s too risky in case I’m very poorly afterwards.

I know this question is a bit different as I know what the underlying issue is, but can any UK people advise me? (Hold onto your hats, I have a specific medical question too.) I literally don’t know what to do. I just get sicker with every infection, and I can’t force the anaesthetist to be comfortable. 

(I realise you only have my word for it, but we haven’t been unpleasant to this guy or anything like that - of course that would be one reason for an issue like this, but it isn’t the problem. All our interactions seemed fine until it fell apart, which is why I and my family, partner etc are so blindsided.) 

I would be SO grateful for any guidance at all. But aside from that, can anyone suggest what I could do to try to reduce the infections I’m getting? I of course use mouthwash etc but I feel like the must be more! They make me even weaker than usual and I’m really losing muscle. Even if no one can give me any tips on my hospital disaster (!), I’d be just as glad to know what I might do to cut down these constant mouth issues.

"[28][F] High testosterone (but still within normal range), have also developed back hair **Age:** 28

**Sex:** Female

**Height:** 5""7

**Weight:** 275 lbs (haven't experienced any unusual weight changes)

**Race:** Caucasian

**Duration of complaint:** Developed the back hair very suddenly this July, I don't know how long my testosterone has been high

**Location:** Southern Ontario

**Any existing relevant medical issues:** Not to my knowledge, and I am NOT pregnant

**Current medications:** 10mg of Cipralex daily, was told to increase to 15mg when my current prescription runs out. I am not on any form of birth control and haven't been since I was about 15-16 (would also like to add that my husband is NOT on testosterone, so there's no chance that he's putting on cream that's rubbing off on me or anything)

**Habits:** I drink about five or six times a year at celebrations or family gatherings. I used to smoke cigarettes but switched to vaping two years ago. My sleep schedule is normal, I haven't noticed a change in hunger/diet or energy levels

**Include a photo if relevant:** I'd prefer not to, but if it's necessary or especially helpful then I could take one of the back hair

----------------------------------------------

**Initial Complaint:**

In July of this year my right shoulder blade up to just below my right shoulder became very itchy. After asking my husband to look at it, we found out that I've randomly grown hair there when I had none before. This isn't like the fine layer of hair most people have on their bodies. It's closer to chest hair in that it's thicker and darker.

I haven't developed it anywhere else on my body. I don't have any other abnormal (sorry if that's the wrong word, not trying to be insensitive) body hair. I have hair on my legs, armpits, pubic area, upper lip, eyebrows, and now my back. I do not have chest hair, chin hair, or thicker/darker hair on my abdomen (but do have some fine fuzz there near the pubic area).

I went to see my doctor about this and it was revealed that my testosterone is higher than he's comfortable with for women, but still within the normal range. I don't quite remember what he said the normal range is, but I'm two points below the highest number that could still be considered normal (I'm sorry if this explanation is unclear, I'm struggling to word this so let me know if you want me to clarify on this).

Because of these two issues (new and random back hair, high testosterone) he sent me for tests to narrow down the issue.

-----------------------------------------

**Tests &amp; Results:**

**Blood Work:** I had blood work done to check multiple things, one of which was testing for something that's supposed to help rule out ovarian cancer. I also had to do a blood test on the heaviest day of my period. The blood work all came back fine. The ovarian cancer thing was normal, he said we don't need to worry about that possibility any more. My hormones (except testosterone) are normal. My blood sugar is normal. I am not insulin resistant or diabetic. I didn't think to ask for a copy of my blood work results, and I apologize for not being able to be specific about the results.

**Transvaginal &amp; Abdominal Ultrasound:** The radiologist didn't find anything unusual. I do not have ovarian cysts. I do not have endometriosis. My organs (liver, kidneys, gallbladder, etc) all look fine. I would like to add here that I show no other symptoms of PCOS other than the hirsutism (and high testosterone if that's a symptom too). My period is super regular - arrives like clock work, lasts 3.5 days every month, with painful cramps but nothing that can't be relieved by Naproxen. If it matters at all, both ultrasounds were done on the first day of my period but the technician said that it wouldn't affect the results in any way. My doctor gave me a copy of my results so if you'd like specific information please feel free to ask.

I had a PAP test done last summer but have not had one since. My doctor said it would be best to do a transvaginal ultrasound instead, so that's what we did.

------------------------------------------------

**Current Complaint:**

Because the tests came back showing no reason for the high testosterone and hirsutism, my doctor is now referring me to an endocrinologist for further testing. We don't know how long it'll be before I can see them because there aren't too many in the city where I live.

I guess I'm just getting anxious. I've been basically given a clean bill of health if you ignore the hirsutism and high testosterone, but that's almost more troubling because I don't have something I can point to as a cause of it.

My doctor considered putting me on something that's supposed to lower my testosterone (I can't remember what the medication was called, I'm sorry), but decided it would be better to refer me to an endocrinologist and let them decide the best way to approach this.

I appreciate his efforts and definitely value his opinion, but I feel like I left his office today with no more answers than when I went in. I know that isn't his fault, I'm sure he's just as upset. It sucks to wait and worry about results only to get no answers.

I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone has an idea of what this could be or something to check that hasn't been considered. I don't know what all he tested for with the blood test, but I'm pretty sure we discussed looking for thyroid issues. He said all the tests came back fine except for my testosterone still being high, so I'm assuming there are no thyroid issues.

"My dad (79m) just got diagnosed with aortic aneurism, should I be more concerned? My dad is 79m, 6’2”, 220 on cholesterol and blood pressure meds (I don’t know which ones) 

Hi there, I talked to my dad yesterday and he recently found out he has an aortic aneurism. He has been on blood pressure meds and cholesterol meds for quite some time. He also has had arterial fibrillation (I think) and has had to have a couple of procedures where they go up the leg and shock the heart back into rhythm. From what he told me, it seems like they caught it early enough to be able to do a procedure (I’m guessing a stent type of thing, he didn’t really know either) but I am now worried of how long something like that lasts or if there are other complications further down the line, or if he will be limited in what he can do after the procedures, and if there is a good prognosis afterward (does the aorta go back to normal size or will it correct itself?) 

He is a pretty healthy in shape guy for being almost 80, and still works for himself and is active.

"Fainted twice in the last week, and also some weird zoning out/leg spasms - does it sound like the normal fainting associated with blood pressure meds and Orthostatic hypotension? Hello! 

Female, white, in my 20s, 177cm, 123kg (I’m losing weight though) white, Australia 

Medications: Lexapro, Atenolol, pritor/amlodipine (just changed from this to only telmosartan last Wednesday) , Metformin (came off this last Wednesday as blood sugar levels are excellent now)

Conditions: Diabetes Type 2, Hypertension, Obese, Anxiety disorder, depression 

I’ve been light headed for months every time I stand. I’ve never had this issue before, but know it can be a common problem (low blood pressure when standing). I’m on 2 fairly strong blood pressure meds (doctor just lowered one of them due to weight loss and light headedness/tiredness feelings lately) and I guess this could be causing it.

The last few weeks I’ve had this issue:

- When I stand up and become headed light-headed, 4 or 5 times it has become very bad and I’ve kind of “zoned out” and I feel my leg buckling up and down (maybe like my knee is bending and unbending) and can’t do much else til it’s over. I think it only lasts like 10 seconds. It happened again yesterday too 

The last week (happened last Wednesday and again yesterday):

- Last Wednesday I stood up from laying down and was really light headed. I grabbed a door handle for support and maybe 30 seconds later I realised I was on the floor. I hit my head and the pain brought me back around. I have no recollection from standing to being on the ground, but I vaguely remember kind of rocking back and forth (or maybe my head was just spinning) for a while on the ground but didn’t realise I was on the ground until I came to after approx. 10-20 seconds (just guessing though as I wasn’t really aware). 

- Yesterday I again was light headed, and next thing I realised I was on the floor with a small wooden table crashed on the ground and all its contents everywhere - and some of the wood splintered and broke off. Again I have no recollection of falling or of any sound from the crash (last thing I remember is standing up and feeling light headed). On the ground I again felt that ‘dizzy’ feeling and felt I was rocking back and forth, but wasn’t aware I was on the ground until a bit after this.

I’ve been feeling sick and tired the last few weeks, my bloods came back fairy normal though (my iron was high for someone not on supplements so my doctor is testing me for one more thing - I forget the name, it begins with ‘h’). 

Do these sound like normal instances for someone dealing with Orthostatic hypotension? Nobody was around either time and I’m a bit worried as I did hit my head the first time - but thankfully not too hard. I mentioned to my doctor I think I passed out once (I saw her before the second instance) and she said it’s likely the blood pressure meds - so we’ve lowered one and I’m going back in a few weeks to see if I can come off some. I didn’t explain the exact issues I’ve been having with the fainting or the leg thing, and worried I should have. 

I’m hoping now I’ve changed blood pressure meds this will stop,  but I’ve been on new meds since Wednesday and it’s just as bad - hopefully I just have to be more patient.

"Feels like a skin tag on top of my right testicle. Seen by a doctor and urologist. I believe it to be the cause of chronic pain in testicle. 21 male white 6’ 170lbs. So around 2 years ago I had a sudden ache in my right testicle that made it difficult to walk. The pain subsided within hours and I scheduled an appointment with my GP. In the meantime I really checked out my right right testicle which where I believed the pain was coming from. On my right testicle a small bump that feels almost identical to a skin tag could be felt. Touching it caused the pain to increase. This made me freak out at the time as I thought of testicular cancer. I saw my GP and he checked everything out. He finally felt the small bumb (it took him a while it’s very hard to feel and may not even by connected to the testicle, it’s very close to all the tubing as well). He said that could be something but wasn’t too concerned. It’s not hard it feels like skin and moves back and forth a bit like a skin tag and it’s very small. So I went on antibiotics and an anti inflammatory. After two weeks I was to report back. The dull ache was still there so he sent me to a urologist. The urologist checked everything said everything felt fine and he couldn’t even feel the small bump. To be safe he wanted me to get a ultrasound. The ultrasound showed nothing. He gave me stronger antibiotics and stronger anti inflammator. Report back in 2 months. After 2 months the pain had gone down about 0. So I told him I was find and he sent me on my way. 6 or so months later my right testicle suddenly had pain similar to the first time where it made it difficult to walk. I went to an urgent care where I was prescribed antibiotics for epididymitis. This time the inflammation in the tubing of my right testicle was pretty clear. After a few weeks the pain went away. Now about every 6 or so months the dull ache comes back. It stays for a few weeks and then goes away. I can still, after feeling around for a bit feel that skin tag kind of bump. It is sensitive to touch. This is so annoying. I’m tired of going to the doctor getting antibiotics that I don’t believe I need. What do I do? Does anyone have any idea what this is?

"Do I have allergies or apnea?? Hello, Reddit. I am in a medical dilemma, because I do not know if I actually have one issue or another. I read the rules of this subreddit so if I accidentally broke the rules of this comm I can edit/remove post as needed.

Since the end of June I've been experiencing symptoms that seem like apnea. Before that time I never had breathing issues while sleeping, plus I rarely snore. My physical stats are below:

&gt;&gt; 40M // 5'11"" // White – Caucasian // 167lbs // Neck is 15.5"" in circumference. 

My apnea symptoms act like this: Right as I am about to tip over into sleep, it feels like the soft palate in the back of my nasal cavity flaps shut, therefore preventing me from exhaling. I'll then wake up to reacquire my breathing. My apnea showed up at almost the same time I was diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder and was put on meds to treat my mental illness. I thought the apnea was brought on by my meds, so I quit them cold-turkey approximately six weeks after I started taking them. (Yes, I told my doctor and he reamed me out, so I started taking my meds a while later. I am still on them.) The apnea went away for about 1.5 weeks near the end of July and I thought to myself I was over it, but then it came back again at the very end of July. I've had it ever since, and it seemed worse when it reappeared.

&gt;&gt; My Bipolar meds were Depakote (Divalproex) and Seroquel (Quetiapine) 100mg at night, but later on the Depakote was swapped out with Oxcarbazepine (Trilyptal) 300mg 2x a day. 

I've seen ENT specialists. I've even had that flexible camera flexed through my nasal cavity clear down to my vocal cords. There are no abnormalities, except my soft palate looks ""a little bit swollen"" and my uvula looks ""long."" So far all other tests show up normal. I have even recorded myself in my sleep with a digital voice recorder and there were no instances of snoring or breathing occlusion. I am so frustrated because the only way I can fall asleep is by taking 150mg of Seroquel, which does work until I wake up sometime in the early morning. That is when the apnea shows up again. There are some mornings I'll wake up at 4am, change position, but not be able to go back to sleep because my throat occludes. I have an overnight sleep study scheduled at the hospital near the end of Nov, with a consultation at the very beginning of Dec.

When these symptoms showed up the second time I saw a few GP doctors and they told me it could be either allergies or a psychological issue. So do I have apnea now, even though I am not obese and never had breathing issues in my sleep in my past, or am I suffering from allergies which I never have this severe before?

It seems to be helping, but recently I’ve been feeling bloating in my bladder, mainly the left side after drinking just a bit of water and I also have the urge to urinate even if very little comes out.

Today, after eating dinner (fish&amp;chips and some nachos) I started feeling this bloating feeling again, but also felt dull pain in the same area when walking. Two hours later, i felt some movement in my bowels in that area and the pain disappeared.

I am a man and I had a vaginal and anal encounter on August 24 of this year and for a little over a week I am really worried about having contracted HIV and I just started thinking that because I have experienced quite noticeable hair loss at the top of my head. I have read every day on the internet and there are cases that relate alopecia and HIV or even Syphilis.

I had an OralQuick test of gums on October 19 and it turned out negative. I know very well that these types of rapid tests look for antibodies but they may not be as accurate because the antibodies can take up to 3 months to appear.

So I have the following questions.

1. How reliable is this negative result?
2. Can hair loss really be associated with these diseases?
3. Would hair loss be a symptom that HIV antibodies have already been generated in my body? Therefore, should the OralQuick test have been positive if I were really HIV positive?

Help please, I am waiting for the results of a 4th generation blood test that, as I was told, is very reliable after week 4. I can no longer wait for this, I am dying.",AskDocs,t3_dl8a51

"25F Losing Sensation in Limbs During Sleep [25/F 5”5. Non-smoker. Diagnosis of fibromyalgia. Medications: Gabapentin 600mg daily and cymbalta 60 mg daily] So, for the past few weeks I’ve had pretty scary experiences at night when I’m falling asleep/asleep. As soon as I’m relaxed enough that I’m just falling asleep, I feel something in my neck and I lose sensation in my limbs. I can’t move them. Sometimes it’s just my legs. Sometimes it’s my legs and arms and I have trouble breathing. Sometimes I’ve lost control of my bladder and bowels. Sometimes the feeling of being bereft of sensation wakes me up. As soon as I become aware of this, I jolt my neck forward out of the position it was in, and I regain all sensation. It only happens when I’m falling asleep, in every position. I went to the ER the first time I lost control of my bladder and they did scans and MRIs, but found nothing but a slight bulging disc. I also have a dowager hump (curved upper spine). I don’t know what’s causing it, but I am literally terrified to the point of tears to go to sleep now. They ER docs told me to try and sleep in another position, but I had already tried that multiple times, in every position possible. I’m only 25 and I’m afraid of this temporary paralysis I experience becoming more than just when I’m super relaxed and lying down. Hell, I want this to STOP happening when I’m relaxed and lying down. I’m barely getting any sleep because I keep being awoken by the lack of sensation and feeling in my neck. I have an appointment with a neurologist in two weeks, but I’m wondering if any of you have dealt with something like this before and is there hope to fix this? Is there any advice you can give me before going to the neurologist so that I can best advocate for myself in finding a solution, not a band-aid? At this point I’m not past the point of begging them to be proactive in treating me, this is preventing me from getting adequate sleep and scaring the living hell out of me.",AskDocs,t3_dlb18k
"Hopefully just sinus headaches? Hi,

24M, 6'4, 200 lbs, non-smoker (allergic, never have never will), medication for depression, some sinus medication, listed on post below.

The last few months have been pretty rough. I've had a lot of headaches, mostly in the front of my head, sometimes to the top of my head and around to my temples. I usually feel great after a night of sleep and then the headaches start mid morning and get worse throughout the day. It hasn't happened in a month or two, but sometimes my headaches would like to eye pain. Only once did I have blurry vision and I was kind of dizzy. I've got to an all purpose urgent care facility and they believed it was either a sinus infection or tension headaches. I was on 10 days worth of antibiotics and went to the chiropractor. That seemed to help, but after the antibiotics, the headaches came back. I then went to an ENT doctor and explained this. He prescribed two weeks of stronger antibiotics and 3 nasal sprays (cleaner like the neti pot, steroid, and a moisturizing spray for dryness since the steroid causes dryness). I was feeling pretty good after about a week, but now it's been about 2 weeks since I finished the antibiotics and my headaches are back. I've still been taking the steroid. Not using the cleaner as much as I should, but getting better about it. I've got a follow-up with the ENT this week or next, but the headaches are pretty rough. 0/10 in the mornings, 2/10 in the early morning, 6-7/10 in the afternoon/evenings. Fortunately it hasn't impacted my sleep, but I'm pretty drowsy throughout the day like I'm not sleeping great.

"[M21] Low FSH and LH after taking Finasteride Hey all,

I'm a male, 21 years old, 135-140lbs, and am currently experiencing some very bad mental and physical side effects following cessation of finasteride. I was originally put on finasteride for hair loss in June, but came off of it after a suicidal episode around 2 months ago, and have since been experiencing brain fog, mood swings/depression, as well as lack of interest in sex, blood flow to my member, etc. I spoke to my GP regarding the issue about a month ago, explaining the various side effects I've experienced since the cessation, and he said that it was most likely outside factors causing the mental and physical side effects. He prescribed me Lexapro, which I took for less than a week before I started developing trouble breathing, which I was then told to stop taking by my GP. He hasn't prescribed me anything else since, but I am currently on the medications below as needed, per my GP and dermatologist. It should also be noted that I was on all the medications below both prior and during my time taking finasteride without any side effects.

- Adderall 10mg IR
- Accutane 20mg
- Hydroxyzine HCL 25mg

I feel as though I should also note that Lexapro didn't affect me in any way, and I experienced no improvement or degradation of either psychological or physical symptoms while I was on it. After I was told to stop taking it and my GP didn't prescribe me anything else, I went and got bloodwork done on my own accord and would love some feedback from an Endo or PCP. From the indication of low LH and FSH and normal levels of Serum Testosterone, I am cautiously weaning a diagnosis of Secondary Hypogonadism.

31F, 115lbs, taking Ativan as needed on occasion and Movisse birth control (that’s a NON combo birth control).

This last May I took Fluoxetine for about one week, for anxiety and panic. The reason it only lasted one week is because I noticed after a couple days that my legs were quite stiff. I thought it was just because the meds had me feeling a bit more on edge. However, doctors told me to stop taking them as it was an undesirable symptom.

Now, ever since then my legs have stayed kind of noticeably tight and stiff pretty much daily, as through I always need to stretch or run them out. Yes, about 5 months. I thought nothing too bad of it and figured it was just stress after all and the Flouoxetine probably wasn’t even to blame (as I’d stopped taking the meds so long ago), I have a lot of physical manifestations of stress, plus I have been walking a lot more... so I just shrugged it off. However, recently I was wondering if this should be a concern even though so much time has passed. The stiffness did come so directly with the medication and is it normal or okay that it’s still there? I suddenly feel stupid for not going back to my doctor and saying they were still stiff even after stopping medication. I can’t say they have WORSENED however.

I suffered tailbone pain immediately after my difficult birth nearly 3 years ago (vaginal forceps delivery due to baby not progressing down birth canal) .

The area is tender to palpate but no bony deformity can be felt externally (haven't had an internal exam).

I recently asked my doctor for more investigation as the pain isn't improving. She ordered an X-ray, which she has reviewed as being ""no abnormalities detected"".

My GP has advised that I should persue physiotherapy (which I'd be paying for privately at ~$90/session) as the pain may be secondary to ? overactive pelvic floor. With regards to my pelvic floor, I've never had problems with painful sex or tampon use, no incontinence or constipation. 

I mentioned the possibility of having a steroid injection into the area and she was unaware of this as a treatment option.

Current medications: Hemorrhoid cream, hydrocortisone cream. 

At the risk of sharing TMI, I want to be thorough in what I'm experiencing. About a year ago my rectum has become very itchy and sore. At times, my perinium would become itchy as well. Hydrocortisone cream will usually take care of it, and if I apply it for a few days consecutively it'll make the problem go away for a week or so and then return. I don't think hemorrhoid cream has proven very helpful.

I don't see anything on the outside of my anus, but it seems like the itching and pain generally comes from just barely inside my rectum. After wiping from a bowel movement, I regularly have smears of bright red blood. Again, not to share TMI but I feel it may be relevant, when it's really bothering me those first couple of wipes feel so ridiculously good. It's like the ultimate scratch of that itch you've never got to in your life.

At times I'll get what I can only describe as small tears or cracks in the skin on my perinium, but this hasn't happened in months. It's very painful when it does, and I suspect this is from too vigorous wiping when my rectum is really itching/hurting.

Could it just be internal hemorrhoids, and if so, do they last that long consecutively? Like I said, I've been dealing with it nearly nonstop for about a year. It hasn't gotten worse or better in that time. I travel for work and so finding and getting in to see a GP is really difficult.

The only possible thing I can think of is that I had some tea the night before that may have been old. Either that or a bug bite that I was unaware of.

Fortunately the swelling in my lips and inner cheeks wasn’t painful and after taking an antihistamine (Claritin) and icing it for many hours it returned back to a somewhat normal state. There is still some swelling on my inner cheeks but not enough that it is very noticeable anymore.

By around 1pm my swelling was looking better and had stabilized. Then around 8pm I started noticing a formation of hives all over my body. I am diagnosed with ADHD and took adderall at around 3pm. Could this have reacted with the antihistamine in my system?

"Clicking noise when I blink Age: 19, Sex: Female, Weight: 155lbs, Height: 5'3

When I blink, my left eyeball makes a clicking sound. It seems to be triggered when wearing my reading glasses while doing computer work at the end of the day. Once it starts, it does not stop until I go to sleep. Nothing helps besides not using my computer/doing homework, which is not an option because I am in college. Interestingly, it only seems to start when I wear my reading glasses. I can't just stop wearing my glasses, though, because I need them to see. I assume its an air bubble, because I can kind of squeeze it out from under my eyelid, but it just comes right back. It drives me crazy.

"Constant cramp like feeling in my foot. 19M, 6’4”, 260lbs (118kg), Electronic cigarette user (previous smoker)

From the title it sounds like a dumb question but I’ll try describe it as best as I can.

In case I use any description as to where it is on my foot it’s on my left foot for more accuracy.

So start start with I have done anything to injure my foot like kicking something, falling, dropping anything etc.

It started about a month ago I got this weird cramp on the top of foot from the middle to around an inch into my ankle on the right side. I assumed nothing on it and wasn’t planning on taking it any further but a month on and it’s starting to get worse.

I find when I’m wearing shoes and going about my day to day life there is absolutely no pain but as I’ve found on my last 4 days off from work the pain is present and amplified when I am not wearing shoes/socks and just walking around the house. The pain I can only describe as a continuous cramp.

I find the pain the worst when walking downstairs however not as bad when walking up stairs (possibly due to the way I walk/stretch it). 

I am on co-codamol 30/500 for arthritis in me knee (separate leg)  when the pain gets bad however even after having taking them the pain is still present all be it reduced.

I’m honestly not to sure what’s wrong and can’t pin point anything from searching. Should I take this to my local GP/ A&amp;E? The reason I have done so is because where I live the wait time for A&amp;E is around 4-8 hours and an emergency appointment is the only way to see a doctor same day and even at that are difficult to get.

"3 years of neck pain / stiff trap.. thinking it’s something more Hey Reddit, first time posting so I apologize if it’s not formatted properly etc. 

Background:

I’m a 20 year old male (5’9, 158lbs) I consider myself fairly active, going to the gym whenever I get the chance and so on..

Since I was 17 I began having pain in my upper trap/neck. Only on my left side, I went to the doctors after about a few weeks because I couldn’t even sleep as the pain was so brutal. 

My doctor began running tons of tests, xrays, cat scans, MRI, and even a biopsy because they thought that the pain may have been caused from a swollen lymph node in the left side of my neck. Roughly where the pain is. 

Luckily there was no cancer or anything, they simply told me to just “wait it out” and “it’ll get better soon”  

Well over the years the pain is still the same. I’ve gone to various different doctors and physiotherapists but not once in the past 3 years have I had one day of total relaxation. I’ve been taking ibuprofen and Tylenol’s at least twice a day to combat the pain. On a scale it has to be at least a 7/10. 

I can still feel the lymph node to this day, I also noticed that when the ibuprofen wears off I get pain down my left arm stopping roughly at my elbow or a little past that. Over this time I’ve become a heavy breather as well. I’ve been congested for several months now, maybe because of all the ibuprofen I’ve been taking, and I’ve noticed a buildup in mucus in my throat that I constantly have to clear. 

I recently had an EMG done on me (2 months ago) and they confirmed I had no nerve damage and it’s all muscular. 

Is it seriously just a sore muscle for all these years or could it be possibly worse? Anything helps as this is ruining my life and making it progressively harder to continue in my career. 

Thanks, anything helps.

"Embarrassing mystery illness (urological issue) and being told nothing is wrong Long post but for anyone knowledgable in the urological field, I desperately need your help

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 22 year old male, It seems I have fallen into the category of ""mystery illness"".

My problem started a few years ago. It is a very embarrassing topic. I noticed testicular swelling in my right epididymis. It ended up increasing in size to the point where it was too large to ignore and was causing a great deal of discomfort. I saw the urologist and was told I had a spermatocele or spermatic cyst or something along those lines, and that my options were to ignore it or get surgery. Shortly before all of this, I found out from an ex that I should get tested for chlamydia because she found out she had it. It turned out I had it and got antibiotics for treatment. Then, probably a year or so later, I forget how but I realized I may have had it again. I went to get treatment a second time (this time, I may have had chlamydia for a year or so before finding out/getting treatment) and was given medication but never recieved confirmation that I had it again. Anyway, as far as the testicular swelling, I tried ignoring it for as long as I could before it became unbearable and I opted for surgery. I flew home to get the surgery. The doctor back home seemed to not take me serious at all and made a big joke out of it, but after I insisted my problem was serious, he performed the surgery.

&amp;#x200B;

The recovery took a while, but I was under the impression my problems were solved and that I would be back to normal in a few months. Fast forward a few months, and I feel the epididymus swelling on my left side as well. I noticed that my right also seemed to be swelling again, in addition to the ""scarring"" from the surgery. As time went on, the swelling got worse and now both sides have full blown spermatoceles and they are making life very uncomfortable, and sex borderline impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""mystery"" part of it is, every urologist i've seen seems to see me for 2 minutes, tell me that everything seems fine and to come back with any other issues. I've seen probably 4 urologists now. Some say all they can find is an epididymal cyst, some say they just see a bit of swelling, some say everything looks fine. All of them say that theres nothing they can do.

&amp;#x200B;

**From my perspective:** I am almost 100% positive that there is a mechanical issue with my sperm/semen production. When I do anything sexual (any sexual stimulation, sex, masturbation, etc.) I feel the epididymus swell up and get harder, and it seems to start from the very bottom where it connects to the testicle. I don't know how to put it into words, but I can literally feel the fluids cramming up and getting blocked/stuck in the tubes. I feel pressure building in the epididymus . Upon ejaculation, there is less than half ""ejaculate"" than there used to be. Id say maybe 25% of the semen is making its way out during ejaculation. Then a few seconds after, I can literally feel fluid traveling back THE WRONG WAY inside in the base of my urethra. It is an extremely odd sensation but that is what is happening/what it feels like. The semen its-self also seems to be weird. Some of it comes out looking normal, but alot of the time, it will come out in extremely dense/sticky clumps (almost the the consistency of dried rubber cement or something). There will be clumps of semen that are almost dry, and are more of a solid than a liquid. I know it is gross to picture, but when I grab it with my fingers, it feels like rubber and it ""splits"" up like a solid rather than a liquid when i squeeze it between my fingers. The swelling and increased hardness of the epididymus will kind of die down a bit maybe 20 minutes or so after ejaculation.

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes, when I can feel extra ""congestion"" in my ejaculatory system, I can ""suck in"" my abdomen and which feels like it encourages my system to push the fluid out, but I can feel that it is clogged up. It is the wierdest sensation. I can feel from the back of my testicles all the way through the rest of my groin area this strange sensation that feels related to an ""orgasmic"" sensation although it does not feel good at all, only that it is in the same area of operation. I would compare it to the feeling of noticing a tooth is starting to kind of come loose. It is kind of a dull ache that is slightly pleasurable but not really, and almost feels like a sneeze building up or something. I can even feel it in the tubes connecting to my kidneys and up in my kidneys sometimes. (Sidenote: a few months ago I also went to the hospital and they found a cyst on one of my kidneys, which I believe may be related)

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I mentioned that I had chlamydia is because I feel like I read somewhere that having chlamydia for too long can do damage to your reproductive system and sperm production. I believe I read somewhere that it can damage something in the epididymus and cause this part to not be able to absorb fluid or something? It was a certain cell or something that helps drain the epididymus, I wish I could remember more than that vague idea. I am seriously wondering if the chlamydia has caused damage to my system that causes problems with either the sperm production, or that function in the epididymus.

&amp;#x200B;

The first urologist I saw, years ago, mentioned something about ""if the problem gets bad enough you can get prescribed this antibiotic/medication that should kill the infection/problem and reduce the swelling/spermatocele"". but that was never followed up on as I flew back home to see another urologist for surgery, thinking he would be aware of that same thing, but he wasnt. When I finally flew back, the original urologist I saw was no longer working, and every one i've seen since then has been no help, and almost seems like they don't believe me at all.

&amp;#x200B;

I just got back from another visit with the urologist (it was just the urologists assistant today as my urologist had to cancel) and was literally told ""I dont see anything wrong, I cant find any swelling"" which had me in complete shock as the question wasn't even if I had swelling, I am way beyond that point and am absolutely positive without a doubt that my epidiyimus's are completely swollen/blocked up.  I keep making appointments only to be told that nothings wrong and I get treated like I'm making everything up.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm going crazy. I can't find anything online about the spermatic system getting ""clogged"" like i'm experiencing, and these urologists have been no help. I really don't want to get surgery again just to have them come back too. I am not making any of this up and it is severely affecting my life.  I had to get prescribed viagra online just to be able to maintain a sex life, at 22! Please help me r/askdocs or point me in the direction of where to find help, because my local urologists are no longer able to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in Advance

Hello, kind doctors of Reddit. I'm hoping you can help me out with this.

I have had an assortment of GI issues for as long as I can remember. Issues with eating making me nauseous, an endless cycle of constipation and diarrhea, getting full without having to eat much, etc. I was recently referred to a GI doctor, who ordered an endoscopy after talking with me. The endoscopy was clean apart from esophageal furrows, which were negative for eosinophils. Nothing abnormal in my stomach.

I've had new symptoms develop since my endoscopy, and I'm getting miserable. Any time I eat something (even something simple like saltine crackers), it feels like there is a ball of fire in my stomach. It starts out feeling heavy like a rock and develops to a deep burning feeling. It persists for hours until (I assume) the food has passed out of my stomach. I have tried tums and prilosec with no improvement.

In other GI news, I have had a significant amount of mucus in my stools lately (it almost looks like jelly sometimes), and I have also been having issues with cramping and gas. Oddly enough, the cramping tends to be at its worst immediately AFTER a bowel movement.

I am following up with my GI doctor eventually, but I'm desperate for relief in the meantime. I can't eat anything without feeling like I want to just curl up in a ball and pass out for several hours.

I’m a college student so I would like to avoid going to the doctor if it’s possible for money reasons, however I work as an acrobat and in theater construction, both of which require me to be very physically capable and I feel like losing a nail would interfere with that. 

Any treatment advice would be appreciated, as well as if I should suck it up and go to the doctor or if I’m over reacting.

"(24M) A really bad reaction to Sertraline for anxiety - what's next? I have been suffering really badly with anxiety for about a year. While I've always been am anxious person, I had a major ""episode"" last December that resulted in about 4 months of daily struggling. I went to the doctors and was prescribed 2mg diazepam to take as and when things got really bad. Just knowing I had the diazepam there for emergencies actually settled my mind a lot, and around March of this year, things started to look up. I got a new job that I enjoyed and spent most of the summer anxiety free. 

Fast forward to around 2 weeks ago, and my contact with work came to an end. My mental health deteriorated and I started having intrusive thoughts and daily, debilitating anxiety. My only respite was evening times, when I was tired enough to fall asleep. My old job offered me a new position, and not wanting to start back in an unhealthy place, I went to back to the doctors and was prescribed 50mg of Sertraline (Zoloft) to help with the anxiety. Within two days of taking the sertraline, my anxiety increased tenfold. I was unable to rest, relax or sit still. I was so nauseous that I was throwing up and the worst symptom was that it felt like my entire nervous system was on fire - physically, it was one of the most uncomfortable sensations I have ever felt. I was twitchy and shaking and unable to relax or sleep. I ended up being taken to the hospital by my girlfriend and given more diazepam, which I have been taking (around 10mg a day) since then (which was around 4 days ago). It has taken 4 days for the physical symptoms to calm down, and while they are not totally gone, I can relax a little bit easier. At first, the diazepam did very little, but is now relaxing me. 

So, backstory out of the way, my question is this: what is my next step medication wise? My anxiety is worse than ever and now I'm afraid to try a different SSRI. While I understand that some people react to different types of SSRIs differently, I can't shake the feeling that the negative symptoms I had were related to my brain not agreeing with the method of action of the drug, rather than a reaction to sertraline specifically. If it makes any difference, I (stupidly) used to take a lot of drugs when i was younger, MDMA especially, and the physical symptoms I had were similar to those of a bad comedown.

"[36M] Back spasms caused by...electric razor? I have had an absolutely baffling issue for as long as I can remember, and none of my doctors have ever been able to solve it.

When  I'm getting a haircut and my stylist (regardless of person, store, or  even country) goes to use an electric razor (of any model) to trim the  hairline on the back of my neck, I get severe back spasms (sort of  mid-back, right hand side only).  Been happening for decades, since I  was just a little kid.  I travel for a living and have had haircuts all  over the world - in other words, experiencing every imaginable variable  within the process of getting a haircut - and it's always the same.

On  very rare occasions, this will also happen from random sounds if they  are coming strongly from the right side of me (example: someone trying  to talk over a loud room, or someone speaking loudly behind me to  someone else).  Those are much more rare, though.

Any   earthly idea what this could be?  Before anyone suggests it, no, I  have never had an even remotely negative experience with electric  razors, so psychological trauma seems out of the question.  I use them  near-daily for my facial hair without issue.  But when it comes to those  haircuts....it's insane.  The spasms are so obvious that I'm basically  involuntarily arching my back.

I have been donating plasma twice a week for about three months. My blood pressure is always fine the entire time. No issues whatsoever. But about a month ago, after I donated and got home, I started making lunch for my kids and my heart started racing and I had to hold myself up. My heart rate was elevated at 176 (via Apple Watch but I know it’s typically spot on testing it against doctor’s equipment so I believe it). Sitting, I was still stuck in the 130s. I rested for a few then got back to making food. Next thing I know, I’m pouring sweat, my head is killing me, and I’m in the bathroom throwing up. 

I get that done, get the kids their food, and then I nap for four hours straight once I lay the toddler down (surprised he actually slept that long too). 

Once I got up from napping, I proceeded to live life normally in my home but I noticed, standing up the rest of the day was elevating my heart rate though sitting down, it was getting down to the 90s.

I continued going to plasma and have had no issues until today. It happened again although it didn’t get as far. I could feel my heart racing and I started getting hot and shallow breaths, but I took numerous breaks and got through the worst of it without getting to the point of throwing up. My chest hurts so bad when it gets like this. It’s hard to breathe. Raising my voice to scold my kids, makes my heart start pumping hard again and my chest hurts. The rest of today I’ve been taking it easy because again, if I stand up, it starts again. Often I get the “nervous” feeling in my gut the rest of the day.

It should be noted, I don’t typically eat breakfast and didn’t eat breakfast for either of these plasma days (or any of my other good plasma days either) and I don’t have coffee or any caffeine on these days. Also, I know for sure I’m not pregnant. I’m still having my regular periods.

"Ear troubles, a simple question on ruptured ear drums, and a frustrating doctor experience. Short and pressing/immediate a question: Is there a danger of putting olive oil in my ear that may possibly have perforated ear drum (e.g. the oil dripping through the perforation into places it's not supposed to go)? If, on the potential chance I have a ruptured ear drum, will there have been dangers if I’ve been putting oil in my ear for wax removal purposes? This includes laying down as the oil floods my ear for 3-5 minutes and then flipping over to let it drain (usually before bed).

Detailed info about my broader symptoms and problem (I don’t know whether it is a ruptured ear drum):

For the past 2 weeks I’ve had ringing in my ear. This is a tinnitus in the form of a constant perpetual high frequency tone in my left ear. Ive had ringing in my ears after a concert, but never for any extended period of time like this. And no, I have not been exposed to any loud extreme noises (we can rule that out).

I’ve also had a lot of wax built up too, as my left ear got clogged shut with wax. I then used things like hydrogen peroxide and oils to help unclog it. During this time I also came down with a bad cold that left me awfully congested. A further point is that my school is on top of a mountain, where I’m having to go up and down quick elevation changes in the car, since in some few cases that can stress the ear drum. In any case, this was all kind of a bad recipe.

I’ve always had a lot of wax in my ears, so my main problem was the tinnitus that was keeping me up at night and making it hard to focus during the day. I saw my doctor last week and he said this is often caused by excess ear wax. So we tried flushing it out, and while a hard pea sized ball of wax came out, I couldn’t continue the flushing because it hurt so much. My ear was in pain that entire day so I waited until the next day only to discover the ringing is still there.

I thought maybe if there’s still wax there, then I should just continue the oil / hydrogen peroxide to get rid of it rather than go through another flushing. I tried the hydrogen peroxide, which usually never hurt me, and instantly my ear ignited with the same kind of intense pain from the flushing except even more painful. It was so painful that I dropped to my knees clutching my head. After this all I could use was the oil. I continued the oil for 5 more days but with zero changes.

Anyways, this made me think perhaps it’s a problem with the ear drum rather than merely wax, especially if the hydrogen peroxide hurts that much. I also noticed that my hearing has been slightly impaired on my left ear as opposed to my right ear.

I went to the doctor this morning and explained everything and he said he can’t see if my ear drum has damage because there is still wax blocking it. We tried flushing the left ear again but it was the same pain. Then we tried the right ear to determine whether it’s a problem with me in general or just with that left ear. The right ear didn’t have the pain, although it was still uncomfortable in different ways. From this he decided I may have an ear infection which accounts for the pain. I'm to use the antibiotic ear drops, with oil to soften the wax, then come back in for another flushing so that he can clear my ear to see the ear drum. 

So I’m not sure what I am suffering from, or what I should do now, but im open to hearing your thoughts. I just want the noise to stop. 

At the very least, it would feel nice to know I didn’t drastically fuck up my ear if I do have a ruptured ear drum (e.g. if the oil dripped through the perforation into places it’s not supposed to go to).

I also can't help but add i've been very frustrated with my family doctor. He is very impatient and I feel like he doesn't really go through all the questions with me. He doubted whether my ear was in as much pain as it was, and is generally dismissive of exploring all the possibilities with me. At the very least

It only lasts for a split second, and it's the same way every time: I'll just be walking along, and the next thing I know I'm tilting over. I do NOT get dizzy, I just...tilt. I usually ""snap out of it"" in time to grab onto something nearby, or I wobble a bit before finding my balance again. I have yet to fall over completely. My mom has seen it happen, and she said it looks like I'm stumbling. This has been going on for 3 years now.

The slurring/messed up speech also happens several times a day for seconds at a time. I'll have the word right there in my head ready to come out, but when I go to say it, it's like my tongue has forgotten how to do so. Sometimes it will come out as a combination of two words, or will be completely slurred. This started around the same time as the coordination issue.

I'm a public school teacher and my students have started to joke (in good humor) that the job must be driving me to drink. Still, that's not something I want ANYONE thinking. I don't drink or even smoke.

An MRI without contrast showed a ""great brain"" according to my neuro, and he saw no reason to do another with contrast. I pushed him to keep looking into it, and a subsequent MRI of my upper and middle spine with contrast showed a few large nodules on my thyroid (I now have a new specialist for that- yay...) but nothing else.

My ENT checked my sinuses and my inner ear/temporal bone with a CT scan because the head MRI showed ""suspicion of Superior Semicircular Canal Dihisence"" in my left ear. That was a dead end as well. The CT showed that the temporal bone on the left is definitely thin, but no dihisence that would explain the loss of balance.

I'm not looking for a magical answer here that would solve the mystery...I could just use some advice on who to see next, maybe what kind of testing to ask for. I'm so lost.

In 2016 I was diagnosed with a moderate to severe H.Pylori infection via EGD.

On behalf of my girlfriend I am asking you guys, hoping to get some suggestions or help.

So she describes her pain as severe and I've seen her squirming and crying as well as throwing up. The pain comes once in a couple months or a couple times a week. The pain is located around the bellybutton, under the breastbone, sometimes reaching the back. She has been going to doctors frequently and they still have no idea what it could be. Acid reflux and allergies have been ruled out and she's on a plant based diet and has tried cutting out everything from time to time such as wheat, coffee, alcohol etc.
She's prescribed a medication called Litalgin, which is quite harmful (according to doctors) and has been banned in some countries and is about to be banned in our country as well, due to the reoccurring risks. Nothing else works at all. She has had a gastroscopy, ultrasound and various tests without any helpful results. 
From reading and doing some research she thinks it's a possibility that it could be helicobacter.

Is there anything she can still try or ask her doctor to do? All help is appreciated, thank you.",AskDocs,t3_dl3vie

Other issues:

-recurrent UTIs/bladder infections

I have a history of dry eye and eye problems. I have had increased vision issues and right sided orbital/eye pain nearly every day since Fall of 2015. In addition to this, to say I have a family history of autoimmune disease would be an understatement. Nearly every female on my mother and fathers side has some form of thyroid dysfunction, and rheumatoid arthritis is also rampant on my mothers side. My mother herself has hypothyroidism, MS, and suspected Sjogren’s syndrome. However, all of my thyroid testing has always been normal. 


I was first diagnosed with blepharitis in 2015, and occasionally have issues where my meiboman glands will need to be expressed, however that does not currently seem to be an issue. I was diagnosed with branch retinal vein occlusions unrelated to birth control use in both eyes with a more prominent occlusion in the right eye in 2017.  At this time, the retinal specialist informed me I had severely dry eye and possibly autoimmune dry eye. My ophthalmologist has repeatedly confirmed this with tear tests in subsequent visits. 


I have increased my water intake and sleep with a humidifier to no avail. I also tried an oil based eye drop at the recommendation of my ophthalmologist, but had to stop because it made my blepharitis much worse. Now I use the TheraTears drops as they seem to hydrate my eyes with out causing any other issues. A referral to a rheumatologist ended poorly with him stating that my issues were stress related and that there was nothing wrong with me. He said I was too young to have an autoimmune disease and even suggested I drop out of grad school to reduce stress. Needless to say, that left a bad taste in my mouth. I finished grad school and now have a low stress job that I enjoy, and yet the issues have continued.


Last Friday my right eye began getting incredibly dry to the point where my lid felt as if it was beginning to stick to my eye. I began using my eye drops every hour or so and tried to make it through the day, thinking that it would eventually get better as the dryness seems to be better some days than others. It was a bit better Saturday, but worsened again on Sunday. This morning I woke up to my eye being nearly swollen shut and very dry.  As I said before, there was a bit of crusting, but not much pain or any green or white discharge. I did a warm compress for 15 minutes and then showered and the swelling reduced to a point where I felt that I would be able to see while driving.


I went into work this morning and was sent home by my boss who was thought  I had pink eye and was worried I might contaminate the lab space (I mainly work with cells). This prompted me to make an appointment with my primary care. I saw him for maybe 10 minutes and reminded him of my history and he told me I simply had viral conjunctivitis and that it was nothing to worry about despite not having any real pain or discharge. I reiterated that my eye simply felt extremely dry and was told that can happen with conjunctivitis. However, I’m not very convinced and will probably be looking for a new primary care shortly as he has never seemed to take me seriously. I was hoping that someone here might have some input as to what might be going on with my eyes and whether I should consider getting a referral to see another rheumatologist/immunologist.

"(22F) Bad, Unprecedented Allergic Reaction? I (22F) have never experienced a reaction in my body quite like this.

Yesterday morning I woke up with my entire upper lip and both cheeks swollen like balloons. Randomly, out of the blue. I do not have any allergies (that I know of) and didn’t eat/drink or come into contact with anything that I would think triggered me.

The only possible thing I can think of is that I had some tea the night before that may have been old. Either that or a bug bite that I was unaware of. I have never experienced swelling like this. Occasionally, eating apples will trigger a tiny part of my lip to swell, but nothing to this magnitude.

Fortunately the swelling in my lips and inner cheeks wasn’t painful and after taking an antihistamine (Claritin) and icing it for many hours it returned back to a somewhat normal state. There is still some swelling on my inner cheeks but not enough that it is very noticeable anymore.

By around 1pm my swelling was looking better (although there was and still is slight swelling in my cheeks) and had stabilized. Then around 8pm I started noticing a formation of hives all over my body. I am diagnosed with ADHD and took adderall at around 3pm. Could this have reacted with the antihistamine in my system?

The hives weren’t too itchy, but were bumpy and red and breaking out everywhere. This morning the color of most of the hives has calmed down all though the bumps are still prominent. I took another dose of Claritin this morning as well.

"My mom has fibromyalgia and I wonder if it's related to hormones. Before I start: I'm just a son concerned with my mom's health that's trying to do my best to cure her incurable illness.

Just think about it: Fibro is mostly diagnosed in women over 40, after menopause basically. And menopause lowers A LOT of important hormones and make you feel like shit, or in other terms ""old"", but most importantly, it makes you more predisposed to chronic illness.

Hormones like testosterone, progesterone, estradiol and HGH will AFFECT the body in a HUGE way to heal itself and feel A LOT better. But I think doctors overlook fibromialgy and WON'T treat it with hormonal therapy because it's harder to do it with a woman's body and it has it's complications of following woman's natural cycle of hormonal release (same hormonal release as menstruation)  AND acceptance of using drugs like testosterone (which is a male hormone and women have it too, just in much lower quantity, but it's CRUCIAL).

Plus it's a relatively unheard condition that not much investment was made to research it thoroughly. So it easier to just use SSRI's to treat it. And, imagine that 90% of men have issues with testosterone after 35 and they MUST be using testosterone therapy to be in optimal health, and the majority of doctors just prescribe them SSRI's to treat their symptoms of lethargy, low energy, low libido, anxiety and depression. **So why would they prescribe an hormonal therapy to women with fibro?**

Based on this fact I'd like to know your opinion guys. Because I'm sending my mom to get her hormonal panel and find an hormonal doctor that would treat her. And if I see that her hormones aren't good at all, and no doctor will put her on hormonal therapy, I'll treat her myself as an experiment for a few months (following every safety measure of course + there's no side effects if it's done right).

I did stop recently ozempic and metformin - albeit not diabetic; highest A1c was 5.2 my range is typically 4.2-5. 


So my doctor is a stickler for the equation to determine MCAS which is baseline tryptase x 1.2 + 2 = significant Tryptase for MCAS. 

My qualm with him and this is he took two tryptase levels when I was critically ill and just out of the hospital, specifically the Icu with Takostubo which my have been caused by kounis syndrome. possibly not for an issue associated to HaT or mast cells. I’m positive for HaT and my previous levels were 17 and 15. 


So if My tryptase were to drop to 12 it fit his needs but the doc doesn’t want another baseline he wants peak level within 3hrs of the onset of a reaction. 

With the new research on fasting having positive effects on the immune system I planned to fast for 3-4 days while taking antihistamines, sirtuins, polyphenols and anti inflammatories, get a blood draw then the next day omit my protocol and consume reactionary substances. I do realize the fasting studies don’t show anything related to histamines or tryptase but I’m humble enough to know this area of study (fasting and immunity) is in its infancy. 

I may also add ketone esters and extremely high phenolic olive oil from Crete or Cyprus. These typically are above 1000mg/kg in polyphenols.

The dvt has been categorised as idiopathic. and a lifelong apixaban treatment with temporary compression therapy was started.

I have played tennis and  field hockey (right handed) days up to the pain, but not for a unusually long time.

Timeline of issues

February 23rd 2019 - Ended up in emergency department in hospital after taking THC capsules. Heart was going crazy, very bad chest pain, shortness of breath, tremor etc for about 5 hours. ECG done in hospital which said sinus tachycardia, my bloods were taking (all fine apart from low magnesium and potassium), chest xray was done (all fine).

February 25th 2019 - started getting weird symptoms (slight pain in chest, lightheadness) so I went to my doctor, he measured my blood pressure, heart bpm etc all fine but put ECG machine in between my hands and could see my heart beat was irregular. He prescribed me digoxin for 5 days to see if it would get it under control, i went back again because I was concerned about the light headness, he again measured heart bpm etc all fine, listened to my chest and said its back in more of a regular beat and prescribed digoxin for 5 more days and to come back again but at the moment he's not overly concerned.

5th March – went for second opinion (different doctor) while still on lanoxin, did 12 lead ECG and blood pressure test – all fine but to come back for check up when off lanoxin. Still quite lightheaded

13th March – off lanoxin 5 days, back to doctor – 12 lead ECG was sinus tachycardia. Still lightheaded, referred to see cardiologist.

18th March – feeling very lightheaded and light tingling in hands, random pains in left arm. Went to hospital, first ECG sinus tachycardia, second okay – bloods were low magnesium and high albumin. Told to get holter monitor done asap and take magnesium supplements.

25th March- feeling a slight bit better, holter monitor done.

4th April – holter results – essential normal (frequent etopic beats) – feeling better now.

4th April – 19th April – feeling normal.

19th April – alcohol, cocaine on night out.

20th April – slight chest pains – dull pain.

21th April to present – chest pain, bad lightheadness when up and walking, bloodshot eyes, pain in left arm now and again.

5th June – feeling better.

14th June – appointment with cardiologist, had ECHO (ultrasound done) - all normal, he was able to detect etopic beats when checking my pulse and could see blood pressure drop when this happened, prescribed metropolol but wasn’t overly concerned.

30th July - alcohol, cocaine on night out

2nd August – chest pain, very bad lightheadness when up and walking, pain in left arm, blood shot watery eyes.

25th August – present – bad chest pain, lightheadness, pain in left arm, watery blood shot eyes.

The chest pain is not serious pain, to be honest I wouldn't even call it a ""pain"" it's more of an ache or discomfort, but it is not sharp or burning , it is dull in nature, sometimes feels like a squeeze and always on the left side above the breast.

I had appointment with cardiologist today (different local cardiologist) he said what I have is ""symptomatic ectopy"" made worse by the use of drugs and alcohol. He didn't have any explanation for the chest pain, he first suggested it could be some joint pain behind the chest wall or could be due to the etopic beats. He said it's highly unlikey its cardiac since it's not brought on my exertion and cardiac chest pain is more centralized in nature.

-Smoker, 1 pack/day
-Daily marijuana use, no other drugs
-Very little alcohol in ~4 years
- Mechanic, prone to dust in orifices

Ever since I got my lower right wisdom tooth out in May, I've been having odd symptoms, but lately the left side of my mouth/throat has been experiencing odd symptoms. And I found an even more odd way to soothe those symptoms. 

Basically, in addition to lymph node swelling in my neck and a hard mass that I can push out against the inside of my jaw if I put my chin to my chest and sway my head to the left + right, my throat and mouth have no feeling on the inside. Like, I cant feel drinks/food/saliva, and occasionally food gets stuck at the base of the tongue on the left side. Also, I cant feel any muscle movement when I ""clear my throat"".

The way I relieve the lack of feeling is putting my index finger into the opening of the left ear, spinning it so that I'm pressing outwards, and making a ""come hither"" motion. 

Can anyone tell me why this offers temporary relief, or better yet, explain why I feel this way in the first place?",AskDocs,t3_dl60cv

"[26F] I’ve been a compulsive overeater my whole life. Suddenly I have no desire to eat Sex: F
Age: 26
Height: 4’9” (~145cm)
Weight: 256lbs (~116kg)
Diagnoses: major depression with psychotic features, severe anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, post traumatic stress disorder

Obviously, I fall under the umbrella of “super morbid obesity.” It’s hard for me to walk, bend over, etc, and this is largely because I was a food hoarder as a child after being abused. I used to have to get as many calories as I could before an adult came home because I’d be punished if I was seen eating by my father. I never broke out of this habit and with the introduction of antidepressants as an adult, intense cravings caused by the medication made it even worse. By the time I was 16, I could pack away enough food for a whole family and at this point I weigh more than both of my obese parents.

I began seeing a psychiatrist in June and have been through a number of new medications and had my diagnoses shifted around. I have not been given any obesity drugs because my insurance won’t cover it. I’ve been on 200mg of sertraline for three years, 300mg bupropion extended release for two years, and my psych has now added: 2mg prazosin, 25mg Vistaril, and 10mg of propranolol (3x a day but I usually only take it once a day.) I have also been prescribed Ritalin during my last visit for fatigue and anhedonia but I haven’t started taking it yet because of bad timing.

Since the introduction of the prazosin, Vistaril, and propranolol, I’ve seen a dramatic reduction in appetite. I’m actually nauseated by the sight or smell of food. I don’t feel hungry at all, and I don’t *want* to eat at all. I feel like I’ll puke if I try to force myself to eat. 

I wound up subconsciously cutting my food intake by more than 3/4 and now I am hardly eating at all. Day before yesterday, I ate about three ounces of ground beef, one bread roll, and a cup of coffee. (When I say a cup of coffee, I don’t mean a venti chocolate mocha thunderfuck. I mean an 8oz mug of coffee with a teaspoon of sugar and about three tablespoons of cream.) Yesterday I had half a cup of coffee and five crackers. This morning I had a cup of coffee and a packet of plain potato chips/crisps because I couldn’t stomach eating anything else. The thought of having some fruit made me dry heave.

It’s been escalating for the past three weeks. If it were a side effect of the drugs, I would’ve imagined it would’ve been most intense at the very beginning and then tapered off but it’s only gotten worse. I also smoke marijuana daily and though I’ve only really gotten “the munchies” on occasion, marijuana does not help the lack of appetite at all and I still feel nauseated thinking about food when I’m high. 

Note that I did bring all of this up with my psychiatrist and she didn’t seem concerned about it. She also knows that I smoke weed and told me I should be fine smoking with my meds as long as I don’t chase my Ritalin with a bong hit. Now with the addition of the Ritalin and stimulants’ history of causing decreased appetite, I’m afraid that I’m going to wind up being one of those rare ultra-fatties who starves to death because I just can’t eat.

Does this sound like something that would be caused by this combination of meds? Is this actually even dangerous rather than just uncomfortable? I have noticed that during my period, I’ve come close to collapsing from lightheadedness, which has never been a PMS symptom of mine. It also wasn’t preceded by mood swings or cramps like it usually is, I just felt really ill. I’m still able to drink a normal amount of water though but even during my menses when I should be having cravings, I had no desire to eat.

Tl;dr fatty suddenly can’t eat, what do

EDIT: Also an additional weird thing I forgot to mention: when I do eat, anything but the blandest food tastes weird. I used to have a problem before I was medicated where all food tasted like metal, but I still scarfed it down. Now food tastes like different food items. My coffee yesterday tasted like cabbage and my coffee this morning tasted like macaroni and cheese. I am using clean cups and making it the exact same way. When I eat something my mom has prepared, I’m tasting the old metal taste along with undertones of mold. I know nothing’s actually wrong with the food but it’s driving me wacky.",AskDocs,t3_dl2hn2

I had anorexia when I was 11 years old which lasted 3 months. I only weighed 66 lbs while being 5”1 at the worst point. During the 3 months I ate minimal amounts of food (a few pieces of bread, an apple, and dinner).

Attempts to treat for: GERD, Heart Issues, Sore Throat, Anxiety, Muscle Relaxers, Chiropractor visits

History of issues: One morning in June I woke up and had a deep pain in my right thigh muscle. I tried icing/heat/rest and it didn't go away, made it painful to walk and lasted 1.5 weeks. It then got better.

In mid July the weird feeling in thigh came back similar but in my right calf muscle. Upon use the calf would start twitching and then stop at rest. This also made my whole right leg feel weird and lasted an entire month then went away.

In August the twitching started to spread to left calf and then arms, right forearm and upper arm muscles on both sides of body. Occasionally in my pelvic area and since then into my thighs and just above my kneecap.

In late August my left calf started to feel strange and twitch at night, to present it still feels uncomfortable to lay flat on a bed with leg resting on it straight. Twitching intensified.

In September to current my left arms started feeling fatigued/weaker in upper arm along with tremor in index finger on left hand. No consistent twitching but it happens at times and especially after use. I can still throw football and pick things up, no clinical weakness per looking up stuff with that. I can still stand on toes and heels and haven't fallen or dropped anything. The twitching is worse at night, for example if I lay on my side and then roll onto my back, the muscles on my sides will twitch for several minutes after then stop.

Small issues during this time: sore throat often with no cough, rib/chest pain intermittent, a couple short fevers and some difficulty thinking/focusing at times.

Any other medical problems?- Iron def anemia and asthma.

Complaint?- flakes of blood in urine in the morning time
Duration of complaint- Started this Saturday.

Ok, so Saturday morning, I saw drops/flakes of blood in my urine. I was shocked and maybe thought my period was coming so I ignored it. No more blood came that day and I just that maybe a mishap inside my body happened. Next, on Sunday morning, I saw a tiny drop and ignored it again, thinking maybe another mishap happened. Finally though, today,  I saw two penny sized flakes/drops. I know a UTI can sometimes cause blood in urine, but this isn’t mixed in with my urine. My urine isn’t cloudy or extremely dark either. And this problem only happens in the morning, as far as I know. I haven’t seen it any other time of day. At first I thought that maybe it was ovulation bleeding but then I figured it wouldn’t be going on for this long. My period is also a few months late (I think I have PCOS) but I’m definitely not pregnant. I also definitely cannot have an STD/STI. I am paranoid about it being some sort of cancer (bladder, cervical etc) but I have no other symptoms other then the tiny amount of blood in the morning. No pain or anything. Anyway, if it doesn’t go away by Friday, I will ask my parents to take me to the doctors (unless it’s urgent) but could anyone tell me what this might be?

Went to see my primary care physician a month ago for “difficulty breathing”. I just felt like I couldn’t take a deep breath and my lungs wouldn’t fill up completely. Like I need to take a yawn to get a fulfilled breath. Doctor checked my lungs and said they were tight and I had a wheeze so he prescribed steroids. I took the steroids and didn’t find them to give me much relief. It freaked me out that I was still not breathing right and I was in full panic for weeks so I went back to my doctor. He checked my lungs again and said I was still tight and wheezing. He prescribed me more steroids for 14 days and an inhaler. He told me it may or may not be asthma. Maybe the costo? It may also just be anxiety. 

I recently finished my last dose of steroids after tapering off almost a week ago. My breathing is slightly better but I still can’t normally take deep breaths like I used too. The thing that is freaking me out now is that I have been having constant muscle spasms and twitches all over my body. I thought that they were a side effect of the prednisone but after being off of them for a week my nerves still twitch randomly every couple of minutes. Sometimes at rest I feel my legs tingle like pins and needles all over. After a workout my legs spasm like crazy. I’ve also had been having problems swallowing which further drives my paranoia. 

I’m worried that the breathing problems and nerve issues are actually symptoms of MS. I am not finding my primary care physician to be very helpful in helping me solve my issues. I was wondering if anyone out here can give me some advice or at least put my mind at ease.

Gastro doc didn't think my stomach pain was purely reflux. Scope showed that except for benign stomach polyps (from long-term ppi use), my stomach is fine and Barrett's is very small now, grade B esophagitis. Celiac was ruled out and ultrasound was done last year and this year, both showing a large growing 3cm gallstone. Ultrasound results say the stone is 3 cm in diameter (increased from 1 yr ago), calcified, and not mobile. Gallbladder wall thickness is upper limits of normal. Sludge in the fundus. Common bile duct is 2mm. Hypoechogenicity in proximal body of the gland, but variable and might be due to overlying shadow or mass.  

Met with surgeon and she said that the size of the gallstone is reason enough to remove my gallbladder, but it's up to me since my pain can't be definitively linked to my gallbladder. There's a risk the large stone will cause a fistula and travel to and obstruct my intestine (gallstone ileus), and also a higher risk of gallbladder cancer. I've never had an attack though and I'm used to the pain. Surgeon said it's up to me whether to get it removed.

* **I drink rarely, don't smoke, and don't use recreational drugs**

I have cystic acne, exclusively around my mouth and jawline, so likely hormonal. I also have other potential PCOS symptoms, particularly hirsutism and weight gain (although doubt I'd be diagnosed with PCOS itself as my periods were 'normal' and regular as clockwork), but the acne is the thing that really kicks my self-confidence.

I started drinking 1-2 cups of spearmint tea a day after I read some studies online that showed that it reduces androgens and improves PCOS-like symptoms, particularly acne. 

3 weeks later and I get my period - which wouldn't be unusual in itself, except that I've had the Mirena IUD for 3.5 years now and with the exception of tender breasts and being emotional in the PMS window and some very slight spotting, I haven't had a period at all since I got it fitted. Period this time was roughly the same as it was pre-IUD - medium heavy, lots of cramping, tiredness.

I'm totally open to having periods again if the tea helped my acne - I didn't go on the IUD to get rid of them. My questions are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is this likely to be what's caused to have a 'true' period for the first time in 3.5 years? Seems awfully coincidental if not, but I'm not a medical professional! No other changes at all (no stress, diet the same, etc) would account for the change.

Medications: Insulin, Beta-blockers, Constipation medications, and occasionally melatonin.

Occupation: Private practice podiatrist/Realtor/Business owner. (It’s mainly just a lot of paperwork she does on a day to day basis.)

So, I’m afraid that my MIL may have something not quite right with her, but it seems nobody really believes me. 

Let’s get to the rather signs and symptoms:

- She hoards a lot of stuff in her house. Not regular hoarding, extreme hoarding to where you can’t navigate properly. Paperwork from stuff she doesn’t need any longer, boxes, clothing, medications, etc.

- Her house is not in good condition, cleanliness wise. The bathroom is growing mold, she lets her dogs urinate and relieve themselves in the house because she doesn’t take them out to use the bathroom on a regular basis. She wears the same outfit every single day, unwashed for months at a time unless her daughter begs to wash them. The kitchen is full of unrefrigerated foods, the sink is covered in mold from food she left in there, etc.

- Despite the above statement, she showers at least three times a day, everyday. Her skin is insanely dry, she doesn’t cut her toenails to where they look painfully long.

- She tends to repeat herself over and over, in statements that she’s stated at least several times in the last week. She’s not self-aware whatsoever of her actions, and has a very bad temper and tends to engage in arguments with her family.

- She is very, very, very closed off from the world. After her husband passed, this only increased. She only ever goes out when going to the store to buy groceries, and when going to work (which is about once a week.) She doesn’t speak to any of her family, and has said that she “doesn’t want their negativity in her life.” Doesn’t talk to anybody but her daughters, and me.

- She tends to sit and stare at nothing for at least an 30 minutes. This is the most worrisome thing I’ve caught her doing, and it’s very... absence-seizure-like almost? We’ll try and speak to her and she continues to stare at nothing up until we have to physically rouse her.

Male, 230 pounds, caucasian, 24

Hello, so for about a month now I’ve had difficulty swallowing solid foods. It’s as if I have forgotten how to swallow even small amounts of food. The food goes to the back of my mouth and just sits there. I have to grit my teeth and clench my hands to force my body to do the swallowing motion. I’m very scared. I have some growths at the back of my mouth and am going to see my gp soon, but fear I’ve developed cancer. Basically the issues are around the epiglottis area, the actual esophagus doesn’t seem to have any issue. I can swallow liquids no problem usually. I’m eating less and very worried. My swallowing reflex seems very weak. At least for solid foods. I’m miserable. What should I ask for when I see my GP? He seems to think it’s psychosomatic. I can swallow liquid at a somewhat decent pace, but it’s not as fast as it used to be and I had seen an ENT recently, I was having these issues but not as bad, and I worry it is some sort of degenerative thing. I’ve had anxiety for years, bad anxiety, but this is new and terrifies me. 

A great grandparent had MS. I brought this up to my GP and he said he’d never heard of inability to swallow as a first symptom of MS. But he didn’t put me at ease either. If it’s not that, what is causing it? Dentist appoinments could help but I have no money to afford it. I was told a speech therapist could somehow help?

Even when I have no food in my mouth at all I have difficulty swallowing. I’m just sitting here in bed trying to swallow and having to force it.

He needs at a minimum a Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) so that he can be fed. We were hoping for a tracheostomy so that he could breathe as well.

I think I’ve felt this pain before after a chest workout, but I can’t remember. My normal assumption would be that I just strained my chest muscles and they’re very, very sore and tender now and this will clear up ina  couple days.
Of course I googled it and saw it could be an esophageal tear or pneumonia or anything I can die from.
I have no other symptoms. (I have diarrhea but I’m sure that’s from vomiting and the fries and pizza I ate) 
Anyway, I have NO insurance and I have class today and I will 100% fail if I don’t go to class because I’ll have gone over the limit for days missed and my professor plays no games.
Again, no insurance, no a doctors visit will be 4k+ which is do not have so I never want to go unless it’s an actual life or death situation.

I guess what I’m asking isn’t “is it possible I’m dying” cause anything is possible, but what I’m asking is.. is it common to have severe chest pain after violently vomiting? It’s not burning so it’s not the acid, it feels like a pulled muscle.

"Chest Pains Male 5’10 22yrs 190lbs

The first time I went the wait was to long and I had work in the morning, the second time (last Friday) they took my blood they took an X-ray and they monitored my heart and said everything looks normal. The best way to describe it would be it feels like someone is squeezing my heart. Very rarely does the pain last for more then a couple minutes.

"Weakness, confusion, and exhaustion and sexual issues. I’m confused and not sure what to do. I’m female, 23. I weigh about 155 pounds and sit at 5 foot 7

I have high blood pressure and bipolar disorder. The high blood pressure has been rising steadily over the last two years or so, especially because I have always heard nurses and doctors mentioning my blood pressure being high for my age. Bipolar disorder is pretty self explanatory. 


I take Lamictal 200 mg
Seroquel 25 mg (for sleep)
Prazosin 2 mg

I started prazosin in August because my psychiatrist noted me having high blood pressure over the last year of being treated for bipolar disorder. (It doesn’t help that I went to the hospital before being on prazosin and had a blood pressure of 158/90) 

Ever since I started it two months ago, I take it at night a couple hours before bed. I feel weak and exhausted when I wake up, and congested. I didn’t feel like this until I stated on prazosin. He did warn me it can make me faint upon standing and cause dizziness. 

I wake up every morning feeling exhausted and tired. I can’t take it during the day because my vision gets so bad, meaning it stays black and I get tunnel vision, and feel a sense of immense weakness where I can’t even hold myself up without issues.

The congestion didn’t start until a couple weeks after taking this medication. But I’m not sure if that is linked or not but it’s really, really bad morning congestion.


I’m going to include other things from my past, too. I don’t even know if the weakness is linked to prazosin, as I have had earlier periods of weakness over the year but it is really exacerbated/ noticed (when I first really noticed it) on prazosin. 

In the past I have had some issues, nothing too extreme.
At age of 5, I had kidney stones. Passed one but still have back and flank pain, and have had some pee in my blood once before about almost two years ago.

Sleep apnea as a baby. (I’m not sure if I ever outgrew it or still have it, honestly. I do snore and have woke up feeling I didn’t get enough air and have occasionally felt myself stop breathing and gone a good bit without breathing and have had to remind myself to breathe) 

At 12, I had a severe staphylococcus (spelling?) infection which was promptly treated (luckily it was not MRSA). 
13, I had appendicitis like symptoms (but did not show appendicitis) and still have them periodically. 

Lately, however, I have had immense issues having sex. I have a history of UTIs. However this isn’t that, I’ve had many of those and know what it is. Lately when it comes to having sex. Penetration hurts, and it hurts inside. I’ve had changes to my menstural cycle. (Went from 28 day cycle to 35+, but it can be linked to lamictal).

Basically, I’m exhausted sometimes, despite enough sleep. I feel weak and dizzy a lot of the time. I have severe nausea in periods that come and go, sometimes heart burn, menstural changes (can be linked to meds?) and it hurts to have sex. 

I don’t know if this is linked or not and I’m just looking for advice on what to do or be checked for at this point.",AskDocs,t3_dl0hq0

"15 years of symptoms, pineal gland cyst, surgery in question - need pointers on what else to look for. 29F, 53kg, 164cm

Hey there, thank you for your time! :)

History: Everything started 15 years ago when I was 14. I had just gotten a kitten, got scratched by it and shortly after I became extremely sick for about a week and a half (high fever, constant vomiting, diarrhea). Didn't think too much of it, went back to school but suffered from sudden attacks of dizzyness and nausea and I felt like my vision had changed (at that point, everything just kind off looked """"off""– but not enough to put a finger on it). After a week of this, I was terrified and a long odyssee of doctor appointments followed. For a year I went to different doctors, spent a lot of time in hospitals and when nothing seemed seriously wrong (besides bad reflux and gastritis), I was sent to a psych ward for minors. There, one year after everything began, they found out I had yersinia that eventually got treated. Also, I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

The next years I spent working on my anxiety and depression and getting back into life. Still, while I tried everything that was possible (therapy, dietary changes, quit smoking, sports, meditation, „just ignore it and it'll go away“), my physical symptoms kept worsening. On top of permanent nausea and severe dizzyness, this weird distorted vision has morphed into double images, dark spots and (limited to my right eye) temporary loss of vision (especially when I lie down on my right side). Headaches that occured 2-3 times a month are now 2-3 times a week, pressure within my skull and especially behind the right eye, daily nightsweats that wake me up every 3-4 hours (humidity and temperature within the bed room checked) and an extreme light sensitivity.  
I've seen every specialist available at least twice: ENTs, ophthalmologists, neurologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, GYNs. My heart is hyperkinetic and my blood and hormonal levels are meh (lymphocytes and SHBG are always too high) but also not bad enough to explain any of this.

Earlier this year I fainted and got sent to the ER because my blood work was off (prob. unrelated). They advised me to follow up with an MRI scan of the head where they found a 10mm pineal gland cyst that can also be found in an older MRI from 2014 (I wasn't informed about it back in 2014 and just found it mentioned as a side note with the recent one).

Though pineal gland cysts usually don't cause any harm, the venn diagramm of the possible symptoms and those that I suffer from is basically a circle. I'v sent my case to two of the biggest neurosurgical units in my country: one attests a compression of the cerebral aqueduct and favors surgery, the other disagrees. I'm currently waiting on a third consultation to clear up this mess but the thought of facing another round of the medical void is scaring me more than surgery in the middle of my freaking brain.

My question: does anybody have any pointers on where else to look? If the consens ends up being no compression/indication to surgery, I'll be out alone again. Where else can I turn to?  
I know that all of this matches anxiety and depression and, from the bottom of my heart, I've lived that for 15 years! I did everything I can to work on it and I'm in a good place mentally (well, as good as someone that is constantely feeling extremely unwell can be) - now I need people to believe me and listen to me when I say that this ain't it.

"[29F] Fell on ribs a month ago, xray showed no breaks, extremely sore today Last month, I tripped and fell on my torso over a toilet seat in the morning. My left side was in excruciating pain and I could not lie on my back that night; I slept in a chair. I went to an urgent care unit the next day and they took x-rays and found no break. This happened when I was at Universal Studios, so I toughed it out and went on some rides that day (every pain killer under the sun + ice).

One week later, bruising showed up on the other side of my body and my other rib started to hurt more.

For two weeks, I wasn't able to sleep on either side of my body. Even up until now, it hurts to sneeze or cough, or roll over on either side. 

Yesterday, I was sitting on the floor, leaning forward to clean out a cupboard. I felt a sudden pain on the left side of my torso. Not as bad as the day I fell, but as bad as ~ four days after the fall. More of my side hurts -- the pain goes further towards my back now than it did before. I put ice on it and took ibprofen then and had to stop cleaning. It still hurts a lot this morning. It hurts when I sneeze, cough, or breathe very deeply (but not normal breaths).

I am leaving my job at the end of this week, moving this weekend, and starting a new job on Monday. I really don't have time to go to my primary doctor right now.

**Questions**: 

Do you think my ribs are broken or just bruised? 

Do you think this could just be a muscle pull/strain? 

Besides ice and ibprofen, is there anything else I should be doing to recover? I have movers coming to help with the heavy lifting, but I still need to clean and pack.

I noticed weird bruising on my legs today. I counted and there are 24 of them altogether, and I have no clue why they are there. I'm a little worried. Since September, I've had abnormal health issues (I exercise a lot, eat well), such as ear infections in both ear that have left me with pulsatile tinnitus. I also got bitten by something or else it was a rash or something. I'm not sure, but either way it left me with weird pimple-like dots on my legs that also became infected. They have mostly gone away with antibiotics; there are 3-4 faint dots left.

I've never had serious health issues before so it's weird to me that in the past two months, I've been bombarded with all these issues. And now I have this bruising. The symptoms seem unrelated but I'm worried that they're all connected to a more serious underlying issue. What should I do?

Not sure if this is relevant, but my BP is usually very low, around 94/60.

I've always had attention issues and after they disrupted work enough to come up in a performance review, I declared it the ""final straw"" and saw a psychiatrist. After a couple meetings with a couple doctors I was diagnosed with attention deficit and was given a prescription for adderall. I brought up that I was kind of scared to take prescription medications but eventually we pushed past it and I agreed I'd give it a shot. Believe it or not, through all of my schooling and high pressure job all-nighters, I have never actually tried the stuff when illegally offered.

I'll be frank and say that, despite my skepticism, the difference really is night and day. I feel more present, I remember better, I listen better, I take better notes, I feel way more ""together."" I'm not jittery on it, I don't exhibit any of the side effects I've read about, and I sincerely believe it to be really helping.

But I've seen the documentaries and I've read the articles about pill pusher doctors and people using it incorrectly. I know the stigmas and how it's kind of like speed or is a ""performance enhancer"" or whatever. My parents and SO really hate that I have a prescription because of the taboo. I have no trust for ""big pharma"" and every day on the news you hear about controlled substance abuse. I knew those kids in school (and as an adult, weirdos in tech or finance) who loved and abused the hell out of these pills.

I have no family history of addiction or alcoholism or anything like that but I am having concerns about introducing this into my life due to, frankly, the reputation. Logically, I know I probably have nothing to worry about because I AM so concerned about it, have never had a substance problem, follow instructions, regularly see my doctor, etc. but it still concerns me because I'm new to all this and it's never been represented in a positive light.

"I still can't see after getting an eye exam and new lenses Edit: I don't wear contacts at all. I just had them to try them out and in the end contacts are just a lot more trouble than they're worth to me. The boxes were just a reference for my old script.


25F caucasian; Pennsylvania U.S.A.; 5'5""; 180lbs and still slowly losing more; no alcohol/smoking/drugs; Mostly normal health (IBS, PACs, and mental health)- no eye history for myself except I've had glasses since I was 9 (2003/2004 school year, not sure if I constantly worse glasses then, but I know I ALWAYS had to wear them since at least 12 y/o which was 2006); 30mg Vyvanse since May 2019 and 100mg Zoloft since July 2019; I believe blood relatives on my moms side had cataract surgery and some other kind of eye surgery too (uncle and pap); I don't have my current script but have sample contacts still from the end of 2016 which is this pic. Left eye is the left side, and right eye is the right side. https://imgur.com/a/zyMSFlh. Vision is definitely worse now though. L is probably 2.25 and R 3.0? No idea. That's a guess. I did make a post for this in r/optometry too so I can hopefully get some kind of answer from someone.


So to explain the title a bit more, literally every time I go for my eye exam, I tell the doctor that things are still fuzzy, but I can still make out what I have to read almost all the time and that I squint still to make it more clear (I don't want to say I can't read it but I say that I can take a guess that the circle looks full so it's an O instead of a C. Should I say that I can't read it then?). I go to Visionworks so I have NEVER seen the same doctor more than once. You would think that due to this, at least one of them would take my concern into consideration and spend a little extra time addressing this issue with me- be it explaining why that is or seeing if the new script can be adjusted more or not. But it's a chain company so they're really only concerned with making money. I understand that here on the internet all you guys can do is give suggestions/explanations for what you do and can't give a good answer as I'm not your patient and you haven't given me an exam.


I can't read road signs at night because everything is really fuzzy, but because I know the area, I know what the signs are, or based off the shape/color I can make a really good guess on what it is. It isn't until I'm right next to the sign I can see it, and at night it's still slightly fuzzy. Knowing where the lanes are really sucks too as where I live, they don't have enough reflectors on the lines in the road and the paint is so faded/old it doesn't illuminate in your headlights anymore (in my opinion). Not to mention all the vehicles with LED lights just blind you and the buttholes that drive with their brights on too don't help being able to see. I avoid driving at night as much as I can unless it's when there is just about no one else on the road. During the day I still can't clearly read large signs but I can read them better than I can at night. That makes me think that the reflections and lights that make all the different signs visible cause me to not be able to read the signs clearly, but I can see them better in natural light.


My big issue though is right now. I thought with my insurance I was able to get an exam and glasses every 6 months. Not an exam every 6 and glasses ever 12. So I go get an exam at the start of September I think (August or September) because my current script from Dec 2018 is not good for me anymore and I thought I could get new lenses at that time. I again explain to this doc I've never had before that I everything is really fuzzy and I can't read any signs without squinting and I obviously can't go like that all the time as I have glasses to fix this issue. I'm an EMT and am working on getting back in with a service so I need to have the best vision I can have- especially if I'm going to be driving and my partner is caring for the patient in the back and I work the second shift or especially if I'm working the 3rd/overnight shift. Go figure, doc said my script only changed a tiny bit. How can such a tiny change cause me to not be able to see clearly at all?? When I was voicing my concerns the doc didn't really seem to care and wanted to get me out the door when I was asking questions.


The last time I had the dilation drops will be 3 years ago this year and last year the tech/doc said that since I had it done recently I didn't *have* to get it done again (I have to pay out of pocket for it so I just go for exam and frames as I'm broke and work doesn't pay enough). And when I had the drops, people complain that things are blurry and a lot brighter, but, I literally notice no difference as everything is still blurry even without the dilation drops. And the brightness, I can't explain that. So all those extra tests that I paid for once before too, they said everything was normal and healthy. I just know you should get the dilation drops every so often as that's the most important of the 3 extra tests they ask if you want to add on.


Is there something that can be done to fix this issue for me? Should I phone around to different offices to see if they will address my concerns and set more time aside for me instead of rushing me out? Is this just how it's supposed to be and my thoughts of crisp/clear vision actually isn't a thing? (Like, when you take a pic on your phone with a good camera and it is nice and clear and crisp is what I mean. Maybe not as crisp as the picture as I understand that's technology, but I hope what I'm saying is being explained well).

Symptoms of severe anxiety started 2 years ago and increased 2 months ago. 

MRI -2017 -Normal

NEUROLOGIST-2014-NORMAL 

Woke up and my forehead is numb more than it has been these past 2 months. It feels like its going to the back of my head.  
I've grown an extreme sensitivity to certain smells and its getting worse. I've started having severe symptoms of panic attacks when exposed. I also have dryness in the back of my throat.  

I had an MRI of the brain in 2017 and it was normal.  My mental state has increased for the worst the past two months.  

These physical symptoms are there and I'm getting scared.  I've had anxiety and panic attacks my whole life and its never been like this.  I never treated it because I never knew I could get worse.  

I've also have become less tolerant of medications and my attacks almost feel seizure like.  

Could this be from a brain tumor or is this all my anxiety and panic disorder? 

Everything has gotten worse for me and I'm scared.  Should I go to the ER? I haven't started antidepressants yet because I've been scared.",AskDocs,t3_dl2wwx
"How do I distinguish between weakness and normal assymetry of the body? 21/Male/Caucasian/155 lbs/6'1""

For the past two months I've been having some strange neurological symptoms.  Twitching/aches/pains/stiffness. I saw a neuro and got an emg of my left leg. This was normal, as well as all blood tests for deficiencies.  Thoracic MRI was normal.  

My symptoms have since gotten worse, and while I'm doing my best to remain optimistic, I feel I may need to schedule another appointment. Right now the current consensus is benign fasiculation syndrome.  

My biggest concern at the moment is my left foot.  It is not NEARLY as agile or strong (at least from what i can tell) as my right.  The toes of my right foot can grip objects easily and I can press them firmly against the ground (even to the point where the smaller joint bends inward).  I can also curl these toes all the way inward. 

The toes on my left foot, however, do not compare. I *can* press then against the floor, but they curl inward instead of flatly/outward.  I cannot satisfyingly curl them all the way inward.  

I should note that my big toe is comparable on either side. Is this just as simple as body assymetry? Or is it something worth making another appointment for?

I have suffered with chronic itching/hives for the last \~7 years of my life that has been controlled by antihistamines. This was first experienced traveling in Egypt where I got food poisoning. Cold water/ temperature changes and exercises seem to exacerbate the symptoms. There is no associated angiodema or cardiorespiratory compromise. I don't have an atopic phenotype. 

I asked my doctor for a ultrasound of the Liver/Gallbladder region in the case that an obstruction is the cause of the itching, perhaps by means of bile backing up into the blood and I have elevated bilirubin levels? But they said if there was an obstruction it would show in the blood test results. I went to receive an allergy test from a specialist but they told me that my case was not an allergy so I didn't have the test and instead had a blood test.

"I 29/M have had a lung infection for a week. The pulmonologist put me on 10 days of prednisone, but after having my heart between 125-135bpm all day yesterday, oncall doctor said to stop the prednisone. What do I do? Age - 29
Weight - 260lbs
I have been sick for a week

Medical History - In 2016 I had the swine flu and ended up in an induced coma for a month and a half. I had ARDS, and was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease because of the permanent scarring, and told it wont get worse.

About a week ago I start wheezing and coughing all day, and had no other symptoms. I go to the doctor and she tells me to just drink water. It continued, so I went to the ER, and they gave me 5 days worth of prednisone. That worked for a day or two, but then it came back, but not as bad as before. I did a follow up with my pulmonologist, who put me on Qvar. That worked for a day, and then all the symptoms came back. So I went to another pulmonologist, because mine wasnt there that day, and he had also seen me before and knows about my history. He put me on 10 days worth of prednisone, and doxycycline. Yesterday, after taking the prednisone for a few days, I went to work, and my heart rate wouldnt go down. It was between 120-135 BPM. I called the oncall doctor and he said he did not agree with the doctor putting me on 10 days worth of prednisone, and said that prednisone can make you hyper and me having anxiety could definitely increase the heart rate and that because I'm 29 my body should handle the increase. He told me to stop the prednisone and go back to the Qvar. Well after finishing my shift, on my way home, all of my symptoms disappeared. I got a full night sleep and didnt cough once, like I did the previous nights, that kept me up most of the night. I woke up and felt great today. Now I have two doctors, telling me to do two different things. Do I continue the prednisone like the pulmonologist said, or do I stop like the oncall dr said.",AskDocs,t3_dl2586

Has had a chronic vomiting situation going on since approx 2 weeks old. 10+ episodes a day, no obvious triggers.

Tested for plyoric stenosis, delayed emptying, esophageal webbing,  had a cranial ultrasound, upper GI x-ray,  fatty oxidation disorders, upper endoscopy, and manometry study.

No trouble feeding.

At 12 weeks he had lost 6oz in 6 days and was put on concentrated Elecare. We then ended up in the ER because his vomiting episodes followed with bouts out lethargy. We were sent home because 'all babies puke' ended up back there the next day and they ran labs. All were unremarkable except his ALT was in the 800s , AST was in the 600s, and Albumin was 2.8. He was admitted to the hospital and tested for everything under the sun. Positive for EBV (assumed placental transfer) and positive for rhinovirus. His albumin continued to drop and his Potassium started to rise. They eventually ran an ng tube for 4 days until he started gaining weight and the LFTs decreased.  We were told that 'sometimes this just happens'

In July he had some kind of upper respiratory bug and had an instance of choking while vomiting. He had a color change so we were advised to head to the ER to check for aspiration. We asked for a CMP, ALT came back approx 65, but his ANC was .7.

Since then his ANC has fluctuated between .7 and 2.3. Hematology ran an antibody test to check for autoimmune neutropenia, it was negative.

Two weeks ago we noticed a rash on his stomach that we and his pediatrician attributed to his constant state of moisture. Over the next week and a half the rash spread and changed. Originally it looked almost like bug bites in size, then changed into small blackish red marks all over his legs the size of pin pricks. Had one instance of white stool, then changed to clay colored. 

He had a standing lab order for a CBC with differential and a CMP. ALT 207, AST 154, Potassium 5, ANC 1.1. The rash then spread to his arms and looked like red pen pricks. Spent the night in the ER where they couldn't give us any more than 'He's a mystery...it's likely something viral'. They ran another CBC and CMP...ANC increased to 1.3 and his LFTs came down a little bit.

He's seen a GI team and a hematology team. His pediatrician is wonderful but we're totally lost.

Weight: 225lbs.

Race: White

Over the past few months, I've noticed two things: I've been burping more frequently, which I never used to do, and occasionally that will bring a bit of vomit to the back of my throat.  Furthermore, twice now, it has been strong enough to actually force a little bit of vomit out of my mouth randomly.  The first time this happened about 3 weeks ago, not long after bending over to get my shoes, but not immediately after bending over.  The second time was today, after bending over to wash my legs in the shower.  Both times were not long after exercising (running both times I think, approximately 2.5-3 miles).  The general increase in burping and the like has been going on for about 8 months now, but that's a \*very\* rough estimate because, until recently, I didn't pay much attention to it.

I don't really feel much GI distress otherwise (not too much bloating, no pain or soreness, no sore throat or sickness).  My appetite is normal as well. 

Existing medication: Zoloft, 150mg, daily, for anxiety.

I do not smoke.  I also don't usually drink in excess, though it's not unusual for me to have a glass of wine, maybe two, at night while watching TV or eating dinner.  I've never thrown up from a night of drinking.  I am also a vegetarian, and my dietary staples include roasted carrots, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts; ""healthy"" (though that's debatable) granola/cereal (Great Grains/Special K); and rice/bean dishes.  My biggest long-term vice is nighttime snacking.  In addition to a dinner and small dessert, I may also have a bowl of cereal and some popcorn later on.  Just carbs in general.  I try to limit it, but picture 700 calories of cereal/peanut butter/etc. on a pretty bad night.

I  had it seen that evening and then put in a splint, then went back the  following morning after the pain got worse. An x ray confirmed a  scaphoid fracture (to my eyes it looked on the X-ray as if a little  chunk was missing from the bone, rather than it being split in two or  fractured from one side to the other). I was put in a short arm plaster  cast and told to get it seen two weeks later to remove the cast, X-ray  again to check up on progress and apply a fiberglass cast for a further  four weeks.

"(21F) Am I normal and healthy? Circulation issues, bad cough, can't burp, etc. This post is a manifestation of my anxieties and I am aware that I am probably overthinking and being dramatic. Sorry. 

5'9"", 105lbs, white. I occasionally drink, I don't smoke cigarettes but do smoke weed and partake in psychedelic mushrooms. I occasionally take antibiotics for UTI's and allergy medicine. I also have an IUD. 

I'm constantly worried about my health, mostly because my mom had a stroke at a VERY young age and because I have such an odd collection of health issues. These fears are probably just because of my bad anxiety and I'm probably fine, and yes, I am seeing a therapist about my anxiety. I have panic attacks fairly regularly. 

Here's everything that's wrong with me:

* I can't burp. See r/noburp for more information. 
* I get colds multiple times a year, and they destroy my work and social life for close to a month sometimes. I think I've gotten more and more colds as I get older. When I'm sick Im constantly swallowing mucus and because I can't burp, it causes me lots of pain in my stomach and I end up needing to vomit air constantly. 
* I have bad seasonal allergies. Can allergies in the fall and spring increase my chances of contracting a cold? If I get some strong allergy medicine that I take every day do you think I'll get colds less frequently?
* I have asthma, so when I get a cold I get a persisting cough for months. After a coughing fit my hands go numb, twitch, and I have trouble moving them, and my eyes twitch. My visions will sometimes go dark around the edges. Is this from a lack of oxygen? My cough gets so bad I vomit very often just from triggering my gag reflex. I went to a doctor about this once and they gave me prescription cough medicine that didn't seem to help much. My coughing fits are getting so bad that I'm worried about my safety when driving my car. And it's effecting my school attendance. I have an inhaler but I feel like it doesn't help. 
* I get very frequent UTI's if I have sex more than once in a day, or if I don't shower that day. I get them so often that I can feel the very early signs of one so I take cranberry pills immediately and drink lots of water and don't even bother going to a doctor. 
* I think i have chilblains. My toes get swollen, red, itchy, and hurt a lot in the winter. 
* I think I'm unhealthily skinny, but I feel like I eat a lot? I don't have the most healthy eating habits (fast food occasionally, and I really like sugary things). I haven't gained weight since early high school. 
* I don't really exercise at all because my knees hurt a lot after a short jog, and I get weezy from the asthma, and for some reason exercise makes the pain from not being able to burp worse. 

I have an irrational fear of having circulation issues that could lead to a stroke, since my mom had one very young. Could my chilblains, lack of oxygen after coughing, thin-ness, and UTI's be early issues of a more serious problem?

"Currently concerned about wife passing out Original Post Sunday at 5pm: Hello. I am writing this for my wife (on her account) whose symptoms are worsening. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as doctors have blew it off in the past and I'm worried about her. Also wondering if I should take her into the ER or just let things play out in the comfort of our home.

* Symptoms are currently present and have been worsening since the middle of the night (Friday/Saturday overnight)
* 25 year old female weighing 170 lbs, not very active lifestyle
* Symptoms: clammy, weakness, dizziness, extreme fatigue, on the edge of passing out with any sort of strain, current heart rate is marked at 43 and typically resting around 65. She looks extra white as she feels worse.
* She is not dehydrated, not malnourished, and has not been overexercising. No drugs, alcohol, or medication.
* Medical history: overall very healthy. However, these symptoms have been coming on more frequently (for a day at a time), then disappear. She's passed out twice that I'm aware of- Nov 2018 and Feb 2019. Both times an EKG was done and no rhythm issues were spotted. They just sent her home to lay low because apparently this is fairly common.

Update Sunday 745PM: Now at the ER seeking help. Decided to bring her in after a heart rate of 39

Update Sunday 1030pm: She's admitted overnight until a specialist can come in asap. They did an EKG(?) and gave her some medicine to get her heart rate up/ relieve symptoms but wasn't responding. She has passed out once shortly after arriving. I'm still trying to comprehend it all and am just doing a lot of waiting

Update Monday 6am: She's been sleeping it off which has been her main relief. I feel like a terrible person because over the last week she's had some dizziness and extreme fatigue, and she would just plop in bed and it would piss me off because it got old after the 3rd day.. Lowest heart rate I've seen while she's been here is 37 :/

Update Monday 1pm: She's feeling a bit more like herself the last couple of hours, praise God! They found instances of an arrhythmia/irregular heart beat, and her symptoms worsen at the same time those irregular heart beats are noted. The concern is why she feels symptoms over longer durations, not just in brief episodes. Bottom line is that she's safe and in the best possible place if things go downhill again. As far as bloodwork they found low potassium but didn't have other serious symptoms from low potassium.

Sex: F

Weight :52kg

Height: 5""2

Medical issues: coeliac disease, psoriasis

non drinker/smoker

Hi everyone, just wanted some advice on where to go please. Yesterday my ear just randomly popped and ever since then it has hurt. It felt clogged and then that night I had an earache. It ended up getting severely bad, it wasn't just my ear, it was like my jaw, and the bones around my ear too. Even my teeth were hurting, it feels like I have a toothache in my ear.

I went to the doctor and he looked at it and it is clear, no ear wax stuck, no infection, nothing built up. He told me to take just painkillers. Thing is, I didn't have pain when he touched around but I had already taken 2 painkillers so I don't know if that is why. The pain gets so bad that I have to hold my ear.

I now notice when I have hot/cold drinks on that side it gets worse. But the thing is I shouldn't have any holes, I brush my teeth, and I have been to the Dentist not long ago. I even checked myself and there is no holes. Normally if I get a hole it hurts severely bad on one tooth only. This certain pain doesn't even always hurt around where my teeth are, it hurts in my ear, and along my jaw on the left side. I do have a lump on my jawline I forgot to mention, it started about a month ago. Don't know if it's lymph node or what.

I am seeing another Dr on Thursday, should I book the dentist before then? It just doesn't make sense because, my ear popped, then the pain started immediately. It's not like it came over time or I woke up with it. It wasn't there 1 second, then the next second it was.

I don't know if it something to do with my jaw and it is radiating to my ear or what. I originally thought it is my ear but then there are times it is the bones behind my ear and next to it on my face. And even painkillers don't help, the most they'll do is ease it for 10-20minutes.

I've always been a poor sleeper.  Falling asleep has been hard my entire life.  It always takes 1+ hours to fall asleep, and staying asleep requires eye masks and earplugs.  Nothing I've done helps.  I stay off of devices for over an hour before sleep, usually reading, exercising has no significant effect, and I've tried most every method my family's GP has suggested, even things like dissolved magnesium.  

Falling asleep and staying asleep are always horrible, but recently it's been far worse.  It's affecting my studies and mental health.

Often what blocks my sleep is thoughts.  Often times when trying to fall asleep for the first time each night, I do so by practicing a type of mindfulness - flame and void method.  I don't think this helps, but I'll eventually be able to fall asleep more often than not.  The problem comes once I wake up, which I do frequently (at least 2x a night).  Once trying to fall back asleep, I find it extremely difficult.  I'll often be unable to relax my mind, continuing whatever type of dream I had before waking up - this often ends up being something that takes active thought, which prevents me from falling asleep.  The worst problem is that I seem unable to change my thoughts at this point.  Recently, I started trying to read for a few minutes before trying to sleep again whenever this happens, but this only has about a 33% success rate.

I am a 42 year old male. I was bitten by a tic during my basic military training. Went to a medic for removal. Should have done it myself because I removed tics on weekly basis from our wiener dog.
That was in 1997 in Western Germany.
The medic had difficulties getting the tic out, maybe parts of the head remained.
There wasn't a significant amount of redness around the bite mark, maybe some redness for 2 or 3 cm in diameter (1 inch). 
I had no further symptoms but haven't been checked for borreliosis. 
In the last decades, the area where I was bitten swells up and starts to itch. 
This only lasts for a couple of hours and then disappears.

For the last 4 days I've got much less sleep than I should have and at the same time have drunk about 3-7 pints a day. 

Yesterday around 5:45 I heard a Thudding in my right ear that lasted a few seconds and then faded. It then happened about 30 minutes later and repeated every so often. It happened more and more infrequently. My pulse was up at the time also. 

As someone with mild tinnitus I'm quite paranoid about symptoms like these so am quite anxious thinking about it.

"Should I get my thyroid levels checked again?  Age: 19 Sex: Male Race: Asian Weight: 135 lbs Height: 5’5

My doc ordered a thyroid blood test a little over a month ago, he said that I was just under what he considered to be abnormal, but a bit higher than the lab's ""normal"" level.  So he told me to come back for another one in a month.

I know I probably should listen to the doctor, but i'm a huge pussy and scared of having my blood taken, and I honestly am feeling a bit better since last month.  The doc told me that it could also be a mental thing (anxiety), and i've been seeing a therapist, so it could be true.

"4 year old child vomiting for 5 days Apologies if i've formatted this wrong, or missed some information. I'm a bit stressed right now. I'll correct anything that needs it.

My daughter, 4F, has been vomiting for 5 days, since we were on a flight from Singapore to UK on Wednesday. It is slowly getting better. For the first 2 days she couldn't hold down anything, even water. Now she can hold down fluids if we're careful not to over do it (say a couple of sips of water or fruit smoothie every 10 minutes). She's had a couple of vomiting bugs before, but this is by far the longest lasting episode. 

Is 5 or more days normal? How long can something like this last? everything I read says that vomiting should stop within a couple of days. I'm worried that it's something more serious, or that a couple of days of basically nothing to eat or drink has done her some damage somehow.

We've seen a nurse, had a phone consultation with a doctor and seen one at after hours, and they all say that what we're doing is fine - keep pushing fluids and it will sort itself out. It doesn't seem like it will right now.

"Chronic cough for about 3months I'm 24, Male, about 85kgs. 176cm, Indian.

As the title says I've had a cough for about three months. It started out as dry cough but became productive now.

At first the coughing was extremely frequent and intense seemingly without any triggers. Making my whole body ache including sharp pain in my chest, belly, back, throat, shoulders, and it also gave me a headache (Sometimes a migraine, but rarely). Too much coughing made me weak and dizzy as well. Had a fever come and go every few days but it was always slight (99°F to 100°F)

The first 2 weeks or so it was dry cough but soon after it became productive. Sometimes wheezing. I even coughed up blood a bunch of times but not too much of it. Get a white, sometimes yellow, sometimes yellowish-red, sometimes yellowish-green phlegm. The coughing was intense. Frequent and INTENSE. Like there was a lot of force behind each cough which lead to a lot of pain. It felt like my lungs wanted to vomit. I couldn't go out of the house for a long time. I spent most of my time at home, leaving the house only to see the doctor or like once a week for half an hour at most. 

Now I cough fairly less but it's still fairly frequent. I cough a lot  less at home in my room and a lot more when I go outside.

I've noticed that certain strong smells trigger a HEAVY cough (it feels as if my chest wants to vomit), like smoke, perfumes, some air fresheners, dirty pee-poo smell, the smell of spice while cooking, etc.

Over the past 2 and a half months I've been on numerous medications which I'll list shortly.

Tests I've done: 
PFT: Normal

X-Ray of chest: Normal

CT-Scan of chest: Normal (though the report said 'no significant abnormalities so idk why it was worded that way but doc said normal)

IGE: Slightly high but not too high, but I don't remember the exact amount, will edit with the value later perhaps (about to sleep)

Creatinine: Normal
GFR: 127 whatever that means.
CBC: WBC were within range but on the higher side.
Vitamin D: Deficiency. (11.2 or 12.1 I don't remember exactly. Will edit update in the morning)

I've visited 3 doctors. 

The first was a general physician who prescribed Cefixime 200mg twice a day.

After seeing little to no change I went to see a Pulmonologist

Over the course of two and a half months I've been seeing the pulmonologist, these are the medications I've taken: 
Fexofenadine + Montelukast tablet once a day.

2 Cough syrups with one with just Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide 

and one with a combination of Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide,Chlorpheniramine Maleate, Ammonium Chloride and Guaifenesin.

A syrup that's an antacid/antiflatulence as I get acidity sometimes (Magaldrate (400 mg/5 ml) + Simethicone (20 mg/5 ml), 10ml thrice a day, half an hour before every meal.)

Corticosteroids: First Deflaxacort (6mg)(21 days tapered off)

 and then Predisolone(10mg) (21 days also tapered off but still felt withdrawal regardless)

Felt about 40%-50% better after my last dose of Predisolone.

Went to the 3rd doctor while still seeing my pulmonologist coz family friends recommend him. Felt like he wasn't listening to my when I described my condition and thought anxiety was causing my cough(though I told him that the cough didn't seem to worsen when I felt anxious or decrease in it's absense) and gave me:

Escitalopram 10mg at night time for 10 days.

This had no effect on my cough and actually worsened my anxiety (which didn't cause more cough either.) So I discontinued after 10 days (has been over a month since)

A week after my last dose of Predisolone, my coughing improved to about 60%-65% and I felt confident about going out again.

The coughing returned after I spent a few hours outside for some work where there were a lot of smells and dust. It was once again the lungs-wanting-to-vomit cough combined with normal productive cough with wheezing.

The lungs-wanting-to-vomit cough comes whenever there are strong smells around. It feels as though my lungs REALLY don't want those particles in them and will get them out even if it kills me lol.

Other symptoms I'm feeling:
Extreme Fatigue even after a little bit of walking of exercise
Sleepiness during the day, even mere hours after waking up.
Extreme Weakness in the muscles probably due to lack of activity
Acid-reflux that sometimes irritates my throat.
Depression because I've been doing nothing and been absolutely worthless wreck of a human who's only causing concern and worrying to those who love me. And I haven't been out of the house much. 

I went back to the Pulmonologist who has now given me Cefixime 200mg and Montelukast (once a day) along with the Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide syrup (thrice a day) and the Antacid/Antiflatulence syrup mentioned earlier and has advised to see if that makes some difference over 10 days. The doctor said he'd perform a Bronchoscopy if it didn't help.

It's been 8 days and I'm not coughing as much as home, as was the case after finishing Prednisolone and I've been able to suppress my cough when exposed to smells that aren't too strong but I still cough INTENSELY (occasional vomit-from-chest-cough + productive frequent coughing) after going outside and exposing myself to strong smells.

Also, sometimes I get a metallic taste in my mouth.

"General lack of motivation and focus/direction in life is making me feel highly irritable and depressed. Extremely poor concentration and short term memory. Hi all, I’m a 25y/o male. Mostly sober with the occasional alcoholic drink, which was minimal before but I’ve cut it to almost nothing because it’s interfering with my sleep and making me feel like garbage the next day. Very active and aside from knee pain which hasn’t allowed me to run in several months I have no physical health issues that I’m aware of. 

To cut to the point, I gave up nicotine (heavy vaping) more than three months ago. I felt incredibly angry and depressed for several days in a row and the nicotine just wasn’t making me feel better, so out of anger/spite/bitterness I said fuck it and quit cold turkey because if it wasn’t making me feel better, why continue? Haven’t had a puff since and really felt no urge to vape in the slightest a little over a week into quitting. 

Problem is that since I’ve quit my irritability, inability to focus, and shitty short term memory have been through the rough. As for my irritability it’s gotten to the point where my mom has mentioned that I’m not myself and have been rude and I myself am miserable due to how irritated I am about anything and everything. My focus is literally out the window, it was pretty poor while vaping but it has become unbearable since, the only way I am able to watch, focus on, and take in any sort of TV is while working out which I have become obsessive about because it’s the only thing that makes me feel normal for a slight slice of my day. When it comes to my short term memory, I find myself constantly backtracking my thoughts to remember what I was thinking just moments ago, only because I’ve already began thinking about something else. I’ve left my oven on once while at work because I forgot to turn it off and couldn’t remember if I turned it off several more times while at work, turns out I did those times. Several times within the last few months I’ve walked away with the sink still running after brushing my teeth and didn’t notice it until later. Quite often I will find myself several miles down the road while driving to work only to not remember any of the last 5 minutes because I’ve been consumed by my thoughts.

"Possible neurological problem causing weird visual phenomenon??? 17F

Along with the visual issues, I also experience tinnitus. This can be extremely irritating and keep me awake at night or unfocused at school. I had these problems even as a young kid. I had trouble explaining it to my parents and doctors, so nobody really knew how to help me. I went to eye doctors as a kid who came up with nothing, sending me off to a neurologist. After an MRI came up with nothing, he wrote off my condition as “some type of visual migraines???” and I basically just ignored my problems pretending i was fine, for YEARS. Lately, I’ve been discovering a lot of things online and wondering if anyone here might be familiar with these issues. I found out that I might have something called “visual snow” which basically causes there to be static in my vision. All. the. time.

I’ve been to an audiologist and asked my eye doctor about the first two problems. They identified no problems with my hearing or vision (besides my need for contacts).

I always feel like I'm going to faint. My doctors always say it's anxiety related but I really believe it isn't. I haven't had a cold/flu at any point recently, so I also know it isn't that.

I have diagnosed generalised anxiety disorder and depression and suffer with polycystic ovaries. I got given the Prochloperazine recently to deal with the nausea.

"Severe digestive issues, a side effect of PPIs? I’m a male in my 20s. I have had acid reflux for years and have been on different brands of PPIs. At first it was like a magic pill that allowed me to eat. Now however, it’s as if I cannot digest anything anymore. I’ve eliminated many foods but no matter what I do, everything I eat still bothers me. By bother I mean gives me lots of gas, bloating, tight feeling in stomach and feeling that the food wants to leave the other end.  I also think I have mild diarrhea as my bowels often are porridge like / watery and smell like sulfur. I always feel better after a bowel movement and my abdomen becomes noticeably less bloated.

I’ve had a gastroscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies but they’ve come back clear. I’ve also been tested for small bacterial overgrowth but it came back clear too. I’ve checked digestive enzymes too and they are fine. I have lactose intolerance but eat lactose free dairy products. 

The doctors have told me it’s IBS but that doesn’t really help me. I don’t think I can eliminate more foods as my diet is already limited and I’m struggling to find things to eat. I’m not sure what to do. I think it’s a complication of the PPI (pantoprazole) that I’m on. I’ve been on PPIs for years and it’s only gotten worse over the years. Also, they don’t treat the reflux as well as when I first started. I think my digestive issues are caused by this medication because when I forget to take my daily dose my stomach feels more at ease and I have less trouble digesting food. My stomach doesn’t feel so tight when I eat without taking the medication. The problem is that I have bad reflux and PPIs are the only thing that help. I’ve tried quitting them slowly over several weeks but it is just not possible to be without them. I’ve tried H2 blockers like zantac but they’re not as effective and I still have digestive issues while on them. 

So I think the medication I’m on is harming me and is severely affecting my life, but at the same time I cannot live without it. What can I do?",AskDocs,t3_dkxqe6

During the day my toes are tinted purple, just like a light purple mixed with skin tones, the purple tint is most visible on the knuckle of the toes.

But at night in bed, or when I shower, my toes turn red and swollen and tingly.

For the longest time I figured I was just pre dispositioned to having perpetually cold feet, I have had cold feet for as long as I can remember, but only in the last 3-4 years have they started to be purple normally and then red and swollen when hot. Also, I try to wear socks or keep them covered as often as possible but they’re still always cold, only warm up / get red and swollen in bed or in hot water.

I was okay with living with my cold feet for the longest time, but now over the last 5ish months my toes have started to blister on my toe knuckles? I don’t notice the blisters much during the day when my feet are cold, but when they’re in a warm red and swollen state, I can see the blisters much more and they’re sore to the touch.

Is this poor circulation? I have a healthy diet and exercise regularly so I didn't think it would be that. Also the blisters are definitely not from an outside source or repeated friction, so what the heck could they be?",AskDocs,t3_dkxp5s

"Help With ON/TN Related Vertigo and Seizures. Really Desperate. 40F **Background:** My spouse (40F) was diagnosed with Occipital Neuralgia over a decade ago, but the symptoms go back 20 years. They've also had symptoms of Trigeminal Neuralgia the entire time (including searing face pain and intense facial spasms), but we didn't know what that was and they were never given a formal diagnosis for it. The symptoms first began on the right side, but have slowly begun creeping up the left side.

Anesthetic, steroid and Botox blocks have all been effective at targeting the pain in the past. Drugs like Zomig barely ever did anything, the only drugs that ever seemed moderately effective were Topamax and beta blockers. The most effective treatment was a radio frequency ablation they had several years ago. Unfortunately we don't have real insurance and aren't in a position to afford any expensive medications or treatments right now

Currently they are self medicating with kratom (no more than 1tbs per day) and medical cannabis (10mg of edible full spectrum oil three times a day) to at least dull the pain and muscle spasms. It has at least allowed them to get out of bed most days. We've been trying to get them on disability/medicaid since I lost the job that was providing top tier insurance, but there have been a lot of roadblocks.

**The Problem:** Before the RFA treatment for their ON, they were having chronic vertigo related to their migraines which was getting progressively worse to the point they could no longer work. They could grit their teeth through the pain most days, but at a certain point they couldn't stay on their feet long enough to get to the bathroom without help. Unfortunately, that vertigo seems to be returning and getting worse by the month. It's almost as bad as before the RFA treatment.

They've also been having mild seizures, which are localized to the shoulder and neck on the right side. Usually they shake rapidly but sometimes they just seize up very painfully, with every muscle from their right shoulder up to the right side of their jaw holding at a maximum flex. They occur in a series of short bursts of about 5 seconds up to a minute over the course of an hour. My spouse is conscious during the shakes, but usually becomes uncomfortably euphoric. Only a few times have they fully passed out or gone limp after a seizure and only for a few seconds.

These seizures first showed up after we lost our insurance a couple years ago, which means we have no official diagnosis if they are related to the neuralgia. The first was about a 1.5 years after their last RAF and a bit less than a year after their last Botox treatment. I can't be certain if that's causal, but that's the timeline. The seizures used to hit once every month or two, but are now daily without the cannabis oil. The self-medicating with kratom and cannabis started **after** the seizures first began. Stopping kratom has had no impact on the seizures, but stopping the cannabis oil does seem to increase their frequency and severity.

One thing that seems to make the seizures much MUCH worse is taking a lot of non-drowsy Dramamine (meclizine) for the vertigo. It specifically causes their jaw and tongue to be much more active during the seizures, and made me worried they might bite their tongue. The seizures and vertigo also don't seem particularly connected to their menstrual cycle.

**Possibly Relevant:** We recently moved from CA to IL for financial reasons, and while the vertigo and seizures had been slowly getting steadily worse over the last year, they seem like they've gotten significantly worse in the four months since the move. My spouse had nearly two months without any cannabis as we dealt with the paperwork, and the oils here have fewer ""cannabidioids"" than the oil they got in CA. The barometer is also wildly different out here, and big barometric shifts have always been a bad trigger for their migraines/cluster headaches.

**The Ask:** I'm just looking for any advice on how to help them manage the vertigo and seizures until our situation changes. The only vertigo solutions I've seen anywhere are those exercises for inner ear crystals, and that's not what this is.

We can't afford the kind of gold tier ACA plan that would cover the diagnostics and treatments for all of this, but I make too much money to qualify for Medicaid until we can get them approved for disability (we've had to restart the process since moving). We spend about $60 to $100 per month on kratom and cannabis, and there's not a lot of room to work with in our budget beyond that. Even after tax credits, the ACA plan we'd need that covers things like Botox is almost $350/month.

We're really desperate, because the better my spouse is doing and the less care they need, the less frazzled I am and the more hours we can put into freelancing to afford proper insurance, diagnostics and treatments. We've been stuck in this spiral for three years now and I'm frankly at a loss for how to get out of it.

"Drastic sudden health issues after antibiotic use? 24 Female, White, Southern US, 107 lbs. 5’5”, Duration of complaints: Since May 2019

In May of this year I developed UTI symptoms (urgency, burning while urinating) and assumed that’s all it was and went to an Urgent Care. Had blood in my urine so they prescribed me some antibiotics for a week. It didn’t help at all. Went to a gynecologist the following week and they diagnosed me with a kidney infection and PID (which is strange because I’ve always been negative for any STI’s and on my visit summary they just listed “acute cystitis” which I’m not sure if that’s a kidney infection or not) but the doctor that saw me after didn’t know why I didn’t get further testing for a kidney infection. Idk. 

So I was put on Doxycycline and Metronizadole. This didn’t seem to work either and I began having vaginal and constipation issues as well and the urinary symptoms got worse and continued. I developed a couple yeast infections (diagnosed) and began to stay constipated week after week, only regularly going like 1 or 2 days a week and then getting constipated again. So after those diagnosed yeast infections, I kept getting yeast infection symptoms but strangely started testing negative for anything. I also developed BV apparently but that was based off just an exam and not a culture, which I don’t understand why it was done like that. But I was given metronidazole again. 

In between this time, I also tried Monistat twice and felt like I had some kind of reaction from hell the second time I used it. I literally went to the emergency room from the pain and they said I could have had some kind of reaction to it. 

So all of this continues for months. Sometimes the urinary symptoms are worse, sometimes the vaginal symptoms (which also include just constant burning) and sometimes the digestive symptoms are worse. I developed awful hemorrhoids as well from the chronic constipation. Sex had also become near impossible and painful because of the constant burning in my vagina. Gyno suggested I might have vulvodynia. Never had issues with pain during sex until all of this started. One gyno also suggested I might have Interstitial Cystitis but when I went to a urologist they were unhelpful and didn’t seem to know much about it. I also had blood in my urine but came back negative for infection. The blood in my urine but no infection has happened for months.  Did find out I have very low vitamin D but not sure what that could affect. 

Fast forward a few weeks ago, I got super sick and couldn’t eat and had terrible stomach pains went to the ER and they said I had a couple of large fecal impactions and gave me an enema which was extremely painful and told me all these laxative cocktails and strong laxatives to take. My constipation has still continued and I’m not sure if the fecal impaction is still there are lot. I’ve gone from 125 to 107 during these few months because I get sick if I eat to much and honestly I’ve gotten scared to eat. I know that I’m underweight and it scares me but the constipation makes it near impossible. 

I currently can’t sleep because the urinary issues are so bad. It’s just this constant, miserable, unbearable urgency. I haven’t drank anything in hours and I still have the urge to go constantly. I’ve lost so much sleep.  

Right now I have an appt with a pelvic floor therapist. Idk what else to do. Anyone know why all of this could have happened all of a sudden and what could it be? Could it have been all the antibiotics? I was totally healthy up until a few months ago now I’m in near constant misery",AskDocs,t3_dkxawy

"Sore throat and pressure in left ear Hi.

21M, 175 cm, 75kg.

My problem: 3 weeks ago on saturday I got sick (sore throat and coughing). I went to the doctor on monday. I was told that my tonsils were red and swollen. I got some tablets which dissolve in water(don't know the name, took it 3 times a day), Dorithricin (3 times a day), and Novorin. I stayed home for a week, I took my medication until they ran out, except for the novorin, I only used it a few times because my nose wasn't that stuffy. I was told to go back if I feel worse. I felt somewhat okay, but next week I felt like my throat was getting sore, but only in the morning, and my nose was somewhat stuffy. I used that nosespray a few times, but since then I haven't used it, because it said not to use it for more than 3-5 days (even though I only used it occasionally). Also I started feeling some pressure in my left ear. I accidentally pushed the earwax inside while trying to clean it (I thought the pressure was caused by earwax), so I had to have it washed out to hear again. I thought that resolved my ear issue.

I was feeling okayish. Then I had to sprint for a short distance with heavy stuff to catch a bus, maybe that made things worse, and I cried a few times in the last few days because something bad happened to a loved one.  - perhaps these made things worse? These happened a few days ago.

So it's been a little bit over 2 weeks since I got initially sick. My throat is somewhat sore, it's a bit annoying, and I cough  a lot, my nose is somewhat stuffy, and there's some pressure in my left ear (but it doesn't hurt). 2 weeks ago I had a fever, I felt tired. Now I only have the symptons I have mentioned. No fever.

I do not drink, smoke or take any medication.

If possible, I'd rather not go to the doctor, because I'd have to wait too much, and I have things to do. Should I go to the doctor? Or at least should I take any medication?

I am only concerned this much, because usually these things go away in less than 2 weeks, but it's been more than two weeks. Could the things I mentioned cause it to get worse again? Also is the pressure in the ear also normal, should I do something about it? Should I start using the nosespray 3 times a day now for 3-5 days? (I only used it maybe 6 times in the past 2 weeks).

"Not sure where to go next 30 y/o male, no history of any serious illnesses. I went to a conference for three weeks and came back not feeling normal. I started having tremors (in my hands and legs, quads, core), headaches, lightheadedness, inner ear ringing and twitching, and some insomnia. The tremors are all the time, mostly when I try to do my workouts or lift something around my work or home. The lightheadedness comes and goes. Headaches are rare now. 

I visited my doctor, who prescribed amoxicillin (thinking it could be a sinus issue) and some Sudafed. The amoxicillin ended up causing some major reactions to my tremors, to the point I couldn’t sleep at night. So I had to stop taking it. 

We did a CT scan on my head for tumors (normal CT head), a plethora of lab tests (for low magnesium, autoimmune, etc). Nothing. Magnesium came back low normal. Visited neurologist, who did a quick visual test and didn’t appear concerned that it could be MS, PD, or the such. Felt confident it was low magnesium. Then labs came back normal. My primary care provider said he’s not sure where to go next. Not the most helpful suggestion. 

Could this be caused by anxiety or stress? I’ve recently come out of a job position that worked me into the ground mentally, but I didn’t think it had really caused these issues.

"Long lasting nerve damage from IV Hi, I'm a 40 Male 5'6"" 255lbs with what I believe to be permanent nerve damage to my hand/wrist.  In August of 2018 I went in for my 5-year colonoscopy (my father died at 53 from colon cancer, so these are suggested fairly young for me).  Before the procedure, I was approached by two nurses, one went over all my information while the other placed the IV on my lower forearm, about an inch or two from my wrist. Upon insertion I felt immediate, shocking, burning pain from the point of insertion through my wrist and into my index, middle and ring fingers.  I've had numerous IVs and shots before and they never bothered me, just a quick stinging sensation that goes away, but the IV caused severe pain right away.  I grunted and huffed and puffed and told the nurse that it hurts.  I told her multiple times that it hurt, but she was rather dismissive and told me that it was fine.  So from that point on until I was wheeled into the room (5-10 minutes maybe) and put under I felt that same amount of intense pain.  

Post procedure, the pain was still there, but not as potent.  I shrugged it off for the first few days thinking it was bruising by the nerve or something.  But a week went by and even the slightest touch to my wrist would create a jolt and moving sensation along the path from where the IV was to my fingertips.  I called the place where my colonoscopy was performed, and they said it's something that would likely go away in a few more days or weeks.  A few months later while on a routine visit to my primary physician I explained to her that I still felt pain, and had numbness and tingling in my fingers (especially at the large knuckles).  She suggested it would eventually go away.  I saw her again about 8 months post colonoscopy, same issues with my hand, but again she thinks it will go away.  

So here I am now, it's been a year and 2 months since that IV was put in.  I still have constant tingling in my ring finger, some numbness in my index and middle fingers.  There's also a completely numb spot between the large knuckles of my index and middle finger (when I touch it it feels cold--and this is where the most intense pain was when the IV was first put in).  That spot on my lower forearm/wrist where the IV was inserted is still sensitive enough where a light brush or tap sends sensations down my fingers especially to that numb spot by my knuckles.  Sometimes when I use my hand (most in particular when I turn a door knob), I get pain all over again, and all of those fingers tingle for up to an hour.  I accidentally brushed knuckles up against my bedroom wall last night and again, tingling and the numb spot between the knuckles started to hurt.  

I play guitar and when I strum I agitate it just like when I turn door knobs--finger picking sometimes does this too.  This really pisses me off and gets me depressed at times.  Years ago I had job related CT problems (even had release surgery in left wrist), and when I couldn't play guitar, or when the playing was too painful I'd just spiral down into months long depression.  I want to find out what I can do about this, cause I'm planning on recording albums soon.  If I go to a neurologist, is this something treatable?  If it hasn't healed fully this long since I first got that IV, does it mean it's permanent.  Should I seek legal advice?",AskDocs,t3_dkrjp9

Medical history: Pulmonary embolism from birth control in early 2016 aneurysmal bone cyst removed in right arm end of 2016 Fell on ice and got concussion which caused immediate pain behind right eye in early 2017

Ive has a slew of neurological problems, to the point where they are now working on sending me to a Cleveland Clinic.

I’m desperately looking for answers. Over the past several months I’ve developed quite a few neurological issues. It started with the right side of my body completely changing in how it felt. That ranged from patches of numbness, to lack of feeling in my muscles. This continued and has since turned into muscle weakness and cramping in both arms and hands, loss of muscle in forearms and legs, loss of hair, significant changes in vision in my right eye like color shifting and double vision, tinnitus in my right ear and I’m pretty sure my right eye has sunken in further with created 4 days of ridiculous vertigo and pressure in my ear and eye.

This has also changed my facial appearance significantly. I used to have a more square/oval face and now it’s all started to droop and my eyes are sunken in and my face is more round. I’ve looked into this and found what is called hatchet face and that seems to describe very well the significant changes in my face in just the last ten months.

From what I’ve read is this muscular dystrophy? Could ANYTHING else be causing all of these problems?

I’m so tired all of the time. Normal tasks like washing my hair cause my right arm and hand to cramp up. I’ve lost a considerable amount of strength and I’ve become I recognizable to myself in the mirror because of the changes to my face.


I’ve had multiple MRIs, CT scans of brain, a full nuclear bone scan, skin biopsy, and Nerve Conduction studies, and a crazy amount of blood tests all of which have revealed nothing. 

My doctors have measured my arms and legs to track the muscle loss, to show a progression of that.

The neuro suspected Parry Romberg but my Rheumatologist doesn’t believe it’s that given the amount of neurological symptoms I’m having and the fact that it’s become bilateral. The rheum now suspects a metabolic or mitochondrial disorder but from what I’ve read it wouldn’t cause the significant changes to my face.

I’m devastated. I don’t know who the person looking in the mirror is anymore. And I’m so tired all of the time. And I honestly just want to know what I’m in for for the rest of my life.

"Possible cause of extreme hunger? Hello! I'm a 5'4, 120 pound, 24 year old Asian (Korean American) female. In the last three years, I've been experiencing pretty severe hunger, despite eating a lot. The first few months this happened, I would eat roughly 3 - 5000 calories a day and gained around 25 pounds, but was constantly ravenously hungry. I would eat several pounds of chicken, vegetables, and like 2000 calories of oatmeal in a day and still feel like I was about to pass out from how hungry I was. I started powerlifting in an attempt to lose some of the weight, which I did, but I was still extremely hungry, despite eating around 2500 - 3000 calories a day. A few internet searches without consulting a doctor (probably a bad idea lol), and I read about how fasting, intermittent fasting, and/or keto could help people who were experiencing severe hunger all the time. I tried it, and it just made the hunger so much worse that after a couple months trying this, I started binging, seemingly uncontrollably. 

I've largely gotten the binging in control with some help from Vyvanse (which I got a prescription for), but the extreme hunger is still there. About 6 months ago, I stopped taking birth control, and haven't gotten a period since then either. I'm not underweight, and I don't do cardio. I train for about 1.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, but it's pretty much all heavy lifting, and I'm otherwise fairly sedentary. My diet mostly consists of lean protein, vegetables, fruit, Greek yogurt, and oatmeal, with eating out on weekends. I average between 2 - 3000 calories/day, but I'm still dealing with feeling ravenously hungry all the time, even after finishing a large meal. 

I'll be getting some hormones tested in two weeks (I think thyroid, fsh/LH, prolactin, and estrogen), when I see a reproductive endocrinologist for the amenorrhea, but in the meantime, does anyone have any suggestions on things I can do to curb the hunger, or know a reason why I can't seem to stop feeling hungry all the time?

"28F Cold/flu symptoms have lasted for 5 weeks now Hi all,

I apologize in advance for the long post, I’m just desperate for advice at this point on what seems to be the absolute worst illness I’ve had to date *knocks on wood*.

My fiancé and I traveled to the UK for vacation from 09/12 through 09/24 and I knew I had some type of flu beginning Thursday 09/19. It went downhill very quickly from there. Incredibly painful body aches, coughing, congestion, nausea, and some vomiting. I took as much cold medicine as I could to try and get me through the days leading up to our flight back home and saw my primary care provider the morning after returning. 

He said I had the flu, ear infections, and a sinus infection. I was prescribed antibiotics along with a Flonase and sent on my way. The symptoms kept progressing and I continued to see him every Tuesday for the next 3 weeks because of new or worsening symptoms including 2 occasions of conjunctivitis that I, I guess, managed to give myself because of the upper respiratory infection. This past week, while most of my symptoms improved, I was having very significant pain in my ears and throat. I was told there is no lingering infections but that I likely have fluid built up in my ears that’s causing the pain. I was eventually given a 5 day dose of Prednisone of 40mg which I just finished today and the ear and lymph node pain is back. Today, I also woke up with the worst round of vertigo I’ve ever had and started running a low fever this evening. I’ve also continued to have a cough that keeps me up at night as well.

I’ve been down with this (AND out of work) for 5 weeks now and I’m struggling with what to do. I know I have to go back to my PCP this week but I will gladly take any other suggestions or advice or just questions to ask at my next visit.

I’ve been on antibiotics, an inhaler, two types of codiene, eye drops, decongestants, OTC pain relievers, and Flonase with what feels to be little relief. 

It’s probably also important to mention that I do have a history of coming down with really bad colds once a year, but none that have ever lasted this long.

I work long hours and am on my feet for 8-10 hours, 5 days a week. I work in a deli so I occasionally get my feet wet and I probably do an average of 30,000 steps per day, at least. 

This past week or two I've noticed that the skin on the bottom of my left foot and between my toes is wearing away and leaving raw skin behind. I thought it was a blister at first, but it's something different and I haven't had these symptoms ever before. It's very painful and stings a lot, and seems to be getting worse. It seems to be exacerbated by sweat and is worst towards the end of my shift. I will attach a photo at the bottom of this post. Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated 💕

"Cold, Flu, Something Else? Good afternoon!  
Female, 26, 120 pounds, 5'5"", Texas, USA, no prior conditions

On Wednesday, I noticed that I was developing a very scratchy throat but didn't think much of it. However, I could barely get through a chapter I was reading out loud to my students because my voice was degrading. I asked the school nurse on Thursday morning because I was feeling really rough, and she advised me to go to the Dr. thinking I might have strep due to a very red throat. The Dr. that evening said I was negative strep and flu, but diagnosed me with the flu anyway saying that it may just be too early. I have been taking Tamiflu twice a day since then. He also advised me to start taking Advil, 2-3 pills every 6 hours religiously to get me through the day. I have not developed any fever or body aches. I don't really feel any better, though. The coughing is hit or miss, and I have started to feel something rattle occasionally in my chest when I have a deep cough, my nose is almost constantly congested and runny, and I have started having sneezing fits. I feel very tired and hot. I'm considering taking time off of work on Tuesday (didn't set anything up for a sub on Friday) and going back to the Dr tomorrow evening. 

Oh, and the only time I have been able to somewhat function this weekend is when I'm on generic dayquil. If I don't take that, I'm a wreck and can't function.

I had no bleeding whatsoever in September, and figured I was done getting my period. However, on Friday(the 18th), I got cramps and later started bleeding. I had 0 cramps and 0 bleeding the next day. I took a pregnancy test this morning(Sunday the 20th), it came back negative, and I started getting killer cramps and heavy bleeding. I looked it up and deduced my IUD probably moved. It got so bad that I called a nurse hotline at a medical place nearby and I would have gone it, but my mom was at work and the nurse said they wouldn't see me by myself since I'm a minor. I tried checking for the strings at home, which I'll admit I haven't done since I got it(although my boyfriend has commented that he's felt them during sex), and I couldn't feel anything. I went to my boyfriend's house and he  checked for them, but said it felt like just the tips of them were sticking out of my cervix. I know that my OBGYN did not cut them super short, and he said they did feel shorter but didn't know how accurate his opinion was since he'd previously felt them with his penis.

I am wondering how common it is to have a very delayed period, if it is likely that my IUD has in fact moved, and if I need to see a doctor about it. If I see a doctor, will they remove it and have me get a new one? Will they remove it and reinsert the same one? Will they reposition it?

"Asymmetrical lymph nodes Male, 22, 5'7, 130lbs, Michigan, Lymphatic system.

So, for my entire life, the lymph nodes on the left side of my body have always been bigger than the right side.

For example, on the left side of my neck, I can feel a few of them, very easily. On the right, most of the time I can't feel any at all. Maybe one or two of them.

On the back of my head near my spinal cord, same deal. I can feel them on both sides, but there seems to be more on the left side.

In my abdomen, I can't really feel any on the right of the groin area. But I've notice that on the left, just left of where my bladder would be, there is a huge lump that feels like a few lymph nodes.

I first noticed this when I was laying down, and it turns out I can only feel this when laying on my back.

So, left of my bladder, there seems to be several large lymph nodes, but on the right in the exact same location, I feel nothing. This leaves me wondering exactly what's going on.

I don't know if I've always had these large lymph nodes left of my bladder, because this is the first time I've felt them.

However, I do vividly remember that when I was a child there was this huge scare because my parents though I had a tumor, but after being examined, doctors said they were just normal lymph nodes. I don't know if these lymph nodes I'm feeling now are the same ones that gave my parents a scare back then, I can't remember.

But why on Earth would I be able to feel all the ones on the left, but not the right? This makes no sense to me, and makes me wonder if I have clammydia, or ghonnorea, or cancer.

The stuff in my groin I just recently noticed, but my lymph nodes have always seemed to be assymetrical and I have no idea why.

Should I be concerned about assymetrical lymph nodes, even though I've always had them?

Also, is this large cluster of nodes left of my bladder a cause for concern?

Edit: It seems inside this cluster, there is an especially large node. I can actually see it poking up from my skin if I suck in my stomach. Part of me thinks this is the same node that caused my parents alarm when I was a kid, but it's very strange that I would just now notice it.",AskDocs,t3_dksr1o

My question is what would the effect of this be on my body in a timespan of 6-9 months?

Would staying in the basement be any help or would there be an equal amount of pollution due to the air conditioning systems?

I could potentially make use of some things to help:

Weather stripping the door between home and garage and installing exhaust system system to get negative pressure in the garage, However worst case scenario: Weather stripping being the only preventative measure I'm taking, what damage am I going to do?

Tl;dr: I can make more money than I ever have in my life, problem is I would have to live in a home connected to a garage potentially filled with smoke and a closed garage door keeping the smoke in for the winter, with only a (well) sealed door to the home keeping it out.

By the time they could afford it, it had been several years since I’d had problems. Diagnosed with AS at 16 and put on immunosuppressives. Now, after 8 years of immunotherapy, I have chronic sore throats. They wax and wane a little—really bad for a week or so, my tonsils will be red, swollen, and full of tonsil stones, and then for a week or two it will still be more sore than normal, but tonsillar inflammation and visible tonsil stones recede. Constantly back and forth, along with sinus drainage/pressure.

Five days ago, I noticed golf ball-ish sized bilateral swellings in my supraclavicular region.  In the typically-concave triangular space above my clavicle, I now had mounds. I immediately suspected lymph nodes, but what I had seemed more pronounced and edematous. Soft, fluid-filled to the touch, not hard, not tender, red or painful. Dr Google told me the more sinister state would be if it \*were\* nodal and specifically unilateral. Instead, both sides swelled evenly. Over three days, they have reduced by 75%. I do currently have cold symptoms (sneezing, minor cough, red, ulcerated throat, fatigue and watery eyes) - I'd usually put nodal swelling down to infection but, from what I know, that would be restricted to cervical nodes, not clavicular.

Background med history: Nothing to report besides menorrhagia and secondary low ferritin. No other known medical conditions, no regular medication. Of note: I started prescription iron tablets two days prior (stopped after noticed swelling, just in case of reaction). Visited my PCP today who, although experienced, said he'd never seen anything of the sort, specifically bilaterally. He was convinced the swellings are not nodal, also did a thorough physical examination - no other raised nodes to feel, no organomegaly felt elsewhere. He said they \*feel\* cutaneous but fat pads wouldn't rise overnight then reduce within days.

Anyone like to take a stab at guessing what these swellings could be? Thanks!",AskDocs,t3_dkuwis
"I’ve noticed three times now that immediately after taking a hit of a spliff I will have a streak of blood in my sputum— zero coughing. What could be causing this? 26M
Light smoker since 2016

This has now happened three times. Wednesday night, Friday afternoon and today noon.

The amount of blood in the spit is as minimal as could be, literally a tiny streak of blood. But this most recent instance there was a little bit more than there had been (probably 2-3x). 

After the second instance, I went to the doctor, had chest x ray done, everything came back looking great.

The doctor told me that it’s probably due to some sort of inflammation in my throat, but said she wasn’t sure— just that she thought it would probably go away.

Seeing the blood for a third time scared me so I went to urgent care where the doctor told me the same as the last. I’m going to schedule an apt with an ENT, but I am hoping that a bright mind on this sub can help me figure out why this is happening.

I’ve only noticed the blood immediately after I exhale the smoke. I have no doubt that’s significant but I just have no idea why that might be happening and the doctor I went to didn’t have any guesses.",AskDocs,t3_dkp93y

Abdominal pain started this morning

History of RA, cluster headaches, IBS, gastroparesis, Reynaud's, lap chole for necrotic gallbladder 2011, 2 c-sections

Current meds: Leflunomide 10 mg QD, Linzess 290 mcg QD, Sulfasalazine 1 g BID, Plaquenil 200 mg BID, Omeprazole 40 mg QD, Metoclopramide 5 mg QID, Mirena IUD

Basically, this morning I woke up with generalized abdominal pain, which is normal for me. I took my morning meds, then 30 minutes later ate a small peanut butter sandwich. Usually, I don't eat in the morning, so that might be relevant. Abdominal pain got worse after eating, which is also expected for me. 

About two hours after eating, most of my stomach pain had abated except for in my RLQ about two inches to the right and one inch below my belly button. It's a constant dull pain with occasional bursts of a sharper stabbing pain, probably a 5/10 when stabby. It's worse with sitting or standing, so I've mostly been laying down today. Also have intermittent nausea, but that's also normal for me. The stabbing pains seem to be getting more frequent and sharper, but aren't unbearable at this point and have been happening since around noon. I'm not currently running a fever. I haven't passed gas or stool since around 11 am. The pain is not worse with coughing.

5 days ago I was hit very hard with a steel pipe in my upper shin.  It broke the skin and immediately swelled to the size of a grapefruit.  The following day the swelling was down considerably and I was able to go to work (I work on my feet as a bartender.) By that night it started hurting a bunch, so the next day I bought an ice pack and starting icing it every 4 hours or so and treating the pain with acetaminophen and the wounded area with neosporin. 

The problem I'm having is mostly with swelling.  I've been sleeping with the leg slightly elevated on a couple pillows and every morning the swelling goes down considerably.  If I try elevating it while awake, laying on the couch with feet up on the arm, it becomes very sensitive and painful when I get up and try to put any weight on the leg. My whole leg is swelling, as well as my foot, even though the injury was to my upper shin.  I do have edema from hypertension and take 80mg furosemide daily to treat it, but even with that and peeing plenty, I can't get the swelling down.  The swelling seems to be getting worse over time, and now on day 5 my foot is really uncomfortable even just sitting down. Walking is very difficult and it feels like I'm limping mostly due to the swelling, not the pain.

Should I be worried or is this a natural part of healing from leg trauma? The pharmacist told me to watch out for headaches or dizziness as a sign of a blood clot, but aside from the leg discomfort I feel totally fine.

I don’t tan/use subbeds either and have always applied sun cream religiously, and I live in the UK.

However, I’m now regretting not getting it checked when I first noticed it but I didn’t really know what melanoma was until I was older and by then I thought it’d be okay because I’d had it for a long time with no noticeable changes. My mum saw it about five years ago and commented that I had a big mole, but didn't seem concerned/didn't press it once I told her I'd had it for years.

For the past two ish years I’ve been occasionally experiencing what I thought was “trapped gas” - bloating, lower stomach pain, uncomfortable, etc but it always went away in a few hours and was infrequent. 

In the past ~6 months this has become an extremely common pain for me. Basically whenever I eat until I feel “full” I will experience this. The pain gets so bad it disabilitating. I feel pain in my lower stomachs but also between my shoulder blades on my back and it radiates. Laying down is the worst. I’ve had nights where exhaustion has taken over and I’ve slept upright. I’ve tried everything - all the otc medication, yoga positions, etc. I’m also not convinced it’s trapped gas anymore as relief doesn’t seem to be because of releasing gas, it just subdues eventually. 
It most often occurs at night but does happen occasionally during the day. 
When I’m experiencing this pain I’m also so extremely bloated that wearing anything slightly restrictive adds to the pain a lot. My belly just feels hard and bloated to touch and I can’t “suck in”. 

I do suffer from anxiety and depression and take 10mg of citalopram, which has led to a ~15lb weight gain. I have always had trouble sleeping.  I had a blood test done in July and I know my doctor included a thyroid test but I’ve read here that not all thyroid tests are ordered the same? 

I don’t know where to begin in terms of cutting certain foods out etc as nothing specific jumps out to me as problematic - and I eat fairly healthily.

2018:  1. Pectus Excavatum( recently diagnosed believe it or not). 2. Jaw infection(L side)due to infected tooth. Both wisdom teeth(top/bottom) were removed on L side. Balance and bite feel off but unsure becasue apparently my bite was so off that my top and bottom teeth(L side) are more than 50% more worn down than the teeth on my R side. Jaw surgery was my best option apparently. 3. TMJ(TMD)


2012: Back injury. L5/L6. Slight bulge to each disc. No major damage noted.Sciatic pain def became more
Noticable. 


2001: R side pain of hip/back/clavicle/neck(burning sensation) almost like the pain runs along since a nerve. This sensation began after working at a theme park(summer 2001) carrying heavy lemonade drinks on my R side and sometimes above my head always having the load on my R side. 


Ever since the burning sensation started all the way back in 2001 i havent felt right. Just off center if i could explain it in a few words. The most notable difference is the invisible force that felt like it was tugging me neck back and to the R toward my R shoulder. This feeling has never left. Its been very noticeable at times and slightly noticeable. Its never left though. lived two decades got married children, divorced. Recovering addict(2105)lost good jobs and most of my friends. 


Fast forward to 2018. Began noticing id wake up and feel like my entire R side had been cranked to the side of the pull of my neck. Like my entire body was being pulled and not just my neck. I noticed i would be standing and be in this pulled position and would have to mimic the posture on the L side of my body to bring me back to neutral.  I would have episodes of shortness of breath because my posture would be so off. Only the R side. Never the left. 


Its almost an everyday/every hour battle with me now. I spend alot of my time concentrateming on not allowing the pull to my R side to win. Because if i give in thats when the pain and breathing issues exacerbate. The mental strain of this being my central concern is slowly killing me. 


Its a situation that since 2001 i havent been able to explain/understand/have others understand.

"Swollen and tender axillary lymph nodes with no apparent signs of infection - what’s going on? Sex: Female

Weight: 110 lbs

Race: Caucasian

Duration of complaint: approx one day

Context: I only noticed the swelling and pain this morning when I woke up. It’s extremely tender to the touch, and it hurts to move my arm as well. Upon taking a look, my lymph node is noticeably swollen. I’d say it’s approximately 3 centimetres/1 inch in diameter, and is about the size of a (large) blueberry. The skin is not red either. I do know that swollen lymph nodes aren’t uncommon when you have an infection, but I have no palpable signs of infection, nor do I have any signs of a virus. No fever, stomach pain, throat pain, sinus pain/drainage, etc. So, that really only leaves more serious causes, but I don’t want to immediately jump to conclusions.

"Unanswered chronic fatigue advice 27 male, white, 5ft9, 80kg

I have experienced some level of tiredness since my teens. I have had all blood tests possible taken with nothing out of place.

Symptoms: a general lethargy, which is accentuated when attempting extreme action eg sprinting - even when very fit, I will be unable to fully exert myself most of the time and will often feel debilitatingly tired when attempting to play rugby. At its worst, during the game I will feel nauseous and will crave sleep and feel as if I can barely hold myself up, I will not be able to concentrate or think properly either - I have had to take myself off the pitch before.  However, what is strange is that by the end of the game, sometimes my body may have ‘woken up’ and I will suddenly feel the energy that my prior fitness training should render me with. I will almost always feel fitter and more lively by the end of a game.  After the match I will feel physically and emotionally drained, often depressed. 

I realise this may come across as a common/vague chronic fatigue issue, however I’m intrigued by the sudden change which can happen in my physiology mid game, which is something I have not come across before or find anything about online.  Any advice around this would be greatly appreciated.

"I can’t listen to music any more...and I work in the music business. Please help! Male | 30 years old | white | Northern California | Adderall XR 20mg

For the last year, whenever I listen to music my eyesight gets blurry. I get disoriented in physical space, and my hands stop working. 

-this happens in “episodes” every day, usually towards the end of day. Motorcycles, sirens, dryers, etc also seem to do it.
-vision: it’s not exactly blurry. If I stare at a word it has definition and I can read it. It’s more like a bright white halo around the outline of objects and words. It’s sort of like the visual feeling you get when you have low blood sugar and everything gets bright, but I don’t feel lightheaded per se.
-hands: i can feel them, I can move them. They just suck. I call them claw hands when it happens. I drop stuff, get extremely clumsy, have trouble w typing, buttons, etc. When I have an “episode” they just feel out of calibration for accuracy to work w/my body.
-physical space disequilibrium: it’s like I have tunnel vision kind of and the world closes in w/ very little periphery. The physical sensation of being really drunk and wobbly, but I’m sober (stopped drinking when symptoms starting affecting me). It doesn’t feel like I’m spinning or the world is spinning. It’s not really dizzy. If someone throws a baseball at your head and you ducked, that’s how I feel w/ everything around me w/ an episode. It’s like the circus scene w/ ether in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

-symptoms don’t always happen all at the same time and can be in varying intensity. It’s usually abrupt. It doesn’t always happen when I stand up, but I think almost always happens after I move or stand up. The. Takes a while to recover (sometimes next day).
-Fairly acute onset when it first started.
-I’ve had fevers roughly every 45 days since it started summer 2018 (I was on the east coast - in mid coast Maine). I went through 2 months of four antibiotics in June 2019. That wiped out the fevers, but not other symptoms.
-heart randomly starts pounding in upper stomach, cspine, and/or chest. Pulse will go up to 115 sometimes; sometimes it’s normal. (this is not a complaint; just an observation).
-tinnitus, esp when lying down, every day. It can get very loud if in the right position. I can live w/ this though and ignore it. ENT said it’s not from conductive hearing loss. I also have irregular hearing loss in my L ear. ENT says also not from sound exposure damage.
-I’ve tried stopping Adderall twice, while working with my psychiatrist. He doesn’t think it’s Adderall at this point. We also discussed anxiety, and he doesn’t think that’s the root cause either (doesn’t feel like anxiety to me either, although when I have an ”episode” in public I become a very awkward potato).

It's not as bad as it was back then, but it's still noticeably painful when I lay down or have non-straight posture. My hypothesis is that accutane is stored in my tissues and has elevated my regular vitamin a concentration, which is why the back pain remains.

I don't usually trust the internet for injuries as virtually everything seems to be open to interpretation, but for this it seemed pretty clear cut, injury out of nowhere (I'd had no pain or anything beforehand), I'm heavy, very active (on top of sports I have a physical job which keeps me on my feet all day, average around 15-20k steps a day just at work according to me Samsung watch), and high arches. I had a bruise on the bottom of my foot near the heel and it was very painful to walk on. Looking online there didn't seem to be an alternative for these symptoms to ""plantar fascia tear""

So I didn't bother going to the doctor's, all advice seemed to be rest and it should be fine in 6-12 weeks. Unfortunately I can't avoid walking due to my job, it's the busy time and absolutely no chance of a couple of weeks off unless I plan on going out of business!

Now it's been about 6 weeks, I'm walking around fine but every now and then can still feel my foot, it doesn't hurt, just doesn't feel quite right, so I'm assuming it's not ready for sport again just yet. 

My question is how will I know when it is ready, and how can I avoid injuring it again straight away? I read that you can start jogging a few weeks before returning to sport, but given that I did not manage the ""2 weeks non weight bearing"" that virtually every website suggests, I'm not sure if that puts me ahead or behind schedule.

I know that “anything is possible” but let’s be real here.. what is the likelihood?  

Shouldn’t their purpose be the same message? A woman who is pregnant would not get her period, she would have an implantation bleed which is noticeably different. I mean bleeding as in chunks of a lining that is used to hold a baby being bled out. You can’t tell me that it’s normal to bleed out that excessive and still be pregnant. 

At least for me, my withdrawal bleed is enough to fill pads/tampons. Which usually gives me relief that I’m not pregnant. But these people on Reddit and the Internet make it all sound like it’s a common thing to still get a heavy withdrawal bleed AND be pregnant. I’ve even tested for pregnancy this month and negative tests haven’t given me relief because everyone here says “well there’s a chance of a false negative...” 

I mean.. I even read of a woman getting false negatives until she was at ten weeks of being pregnant and everyone said “oh yeah same” as if that’s normal? Wouldn’t the FDA ban pregnancy tests that are notorious for giving inaccurate results for so long?

So why would someone tell me I could bleed that much out and still be pregnant while on the combo pill? This mix of information is what’s giving me anxiety about being pregnant (missed 2 pills in the month before, still took a Plan B). I’ve had my withdrawal bleed since having sex (it’s been a little over a month since having sex) but now I feel like there’s no way of knowing if I’m good or not.

"[M 27, gay] Ongoing prostate pain # Age:27 Sex:Male Weight:185 lbs Race:White Duration: 6 months Location: Groin Conditions: pain in prostate and testicle Medications:  Etodolac, SMZ/TMP DS

For about 6 months I've been having pain in my prostate and testicles. At first, it was very occasional, and if I gave myself a gentle prostate massage it'd go away. For the last month or so, however, it's increased drastically. Typically the testicle pain is more due to the area being hyper-sensitive (I'm assuming from epididymitis). The pain gets worse if I need to poop, urinate, or have an erection, though it also increases when I exercise. If I give myself a prostate massage the pain goes away for a decent amount of time, typically around 1-2 days, but will flare up under the erection etc. conditions. 

I have been to 2 urologists- the first gave me 3 weeks of anti-biotics, and when it didn't help, referred me to his colleague.  The second gave me 3 more weeks of anti-biotics. I'm on the last 4 days of the second set of anti-biotics and the pain is still a problem.

I am sexually active, however I always use a condom and screenings for STD's have come up negative. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",AskDocs,t3_dkndyx
"Celiac VS gluten sensitivity. 24F. NHL white, 5’4 180lbs. Current medications; multivitamin, vitamin D, birth control, Wellbutrin 300mg XL. Location: USA. 

Hi everyone! 

I’m a 24 year old female. I’ve been having GI problems for a while. In May, I went to my doctor and they said it was anxiety/stress related IBS which I didn’t disagree with. I was put on a few different medications, they helped to an extent. I was taking antispasmodic drugs every morning since May in hopes of not shitting myself on my way to work. My stools were fatty (if I didn’t have diarrhea that day), pale in color, sometimes full of mucus, sorry for the TMI. 

My grandfather has a wheat allergy AND celiac. 

The end of September/beginning of October symptoms really ramped up and I had some new ones as well. I had headaches just about daily, this brain fog where I’d forget what I was doing in the middle of doing it, not sleeping well at night, no real appetite, constantly in the bathroom, horrible stomach pains, joint pains that I couldn’t explain, and I was sleeping 10 hours a night and still exhausted. 

The second week of October I talked to my doctor and told him everything (this was on a Friday). At this point, I wanted to die. He instructed me to stop eating all wheat/gluten products immediately and I needed to do full blood work on Monday, including a celiac test. The next day, I woke up with a rash on my face. I used MDLIVE and was given a low dose of medrol. I was doing okay. Monday, I began breaking out into rashes all over at work. I left and went right to urgent care, I was having an allergic reaction to something. They gave me high doses of Benadryl and 80MG of prednisone for a week. I did my blood work as planned this day. 

I followed up with my doctor last week to go over everything. I don’t have celiac according to the blood tests. All other blood work/counts in the normal ranges. As far as the gluten diet...I haven’t had a single GI problem since, I’m not breaking into rashes, I’m sleeping *better* and not constantly tired, no more headaches, no more joint pain. The rest of the blood tests show I’m deficient in a few different vitamins - including vitamin D. I was put on 1000mg of vitamin D per day along with a multivitamin. Obviously continuing on the GF diet. 

I haven’t needed a single antispasmodic drug, my stools are completely normal in color and in form for once in I don’t know how long. BMs are on a normal schedule - no more urgency no longer in the bathroom countless times per day. I feel really really good. 

Right now, I’m just diagnosed as gluten sensitive. But my doctors radar was a little high because of the vitamin deficiencies as well, typically only seen with CD and not sensitivity. I was referred to an allergist to be tested for every food allergy under the sun which I’m getting on Tuesday. My doctor is also ordering more blood tests to look for hoshimoto disease and fibromyalgia - apparently they run hand in hand with gluten sensitivity and CD. 

I wasn’t referred to GI. CD test negative, and no antibodies. But my doctor wants to repeat all tests in about 6 months. He said the sensitivity is enough to cause minor damage to the body but not nearly as much as CD would. Also instructed to not even think about touching gluten and no cheating - a pretzel at this point would take me out for a week. 

Is it typical for someone who is just “gluten sensitive” to be put through the ringer of tests just as someone with CD? Also, is it likely with just a sensitivity that I could have the vitamin deficiencies? A wild scenario, is the possible to have CD and not have produced antibodies in the earlier stages? Could the steroids have messed with test results?

I have no desire to see GI about this or do an endoscopy. I suppose regardless it’s the same outcome for me - I can’t have gluten in any capacity. Just kind of wondering for my own peace of mind/benefit.",AskDocs,t3_dkqmj0
"Possible Hernia? Male/21/5’8/143lbs/Non Smoker/ No major medical history 

I woke up this morning with a pain that came out of left field. At first I thought it was my right testicle but it’s actually the area in between the leg and the lower abdominal area. The pain only appears and does radiate a little tiny bit to my right testicle if I flex my abdominal muscles or push my “contents” up towards my body. Yesterday I had no pain, did no strenuous activity, nothing. Actually it was a really relaxing day.

Took macrobid for a uti early September for 7 days 


I think I may have a UTI. I started feeling pains and burning during urination Thursday night. Then Friday I was alright during the day, but the symptoms started up again in the evening. Saturday I woke up and my first pee in the morning was awful. I felt like my muscles were clenching so tightly. Went to lay down, and had horrible abdominal cramping. Went to a walk in clinic and had a urine test. Peeing into the cup felt fine, no pain or burning. The doctor said there’s a tiny amount of blood in my urine, it wasn’t visible to the naked eye. I didn’t see it in the toilet or anything.  He prescribed macrobid and told me to take it if my symptoms get worse. He said he’d send my urine sample off for further testing.  This morning, urination was really painful but I’ve been drinking a lot of water to flush out my bladder and I’m feeling better. 

Is it normal for symptoms to be so off and on with a UTI? I’m thinking of filling the prescription but I finished 7 days of amoxicillin a week ago for tonsillitis.

I drove myself to an urgent care where they thought I was dehydrated and heavily suggested I go to an ER where I can get IVs and blood/urine tests. That's what I did.  
They gave me fluids and an anti nausea. They pushed on my abdominal area and there was no pain. They asked for other symptoms, to which I responded there were absolutely none. No headaches, sore throats, diarrhea, etc. Blood work showed ketones and a low CO2 level. They said this is from not eating and hyperventilating while vomiting.  
They also said they were straight up making a guess that I have a viral stomach infection that needs to clear on its own. They sent me on my way with three days of anti nausea medication and hoped that my immune system will work better when I have food and water kept down.  
 
That was Saturday when it's been going on since Thursday. It's Sunday night, almost Monday. I'm going to be out of this medication soon and, without it, I am still miserable and nauseous.

"No answers from multiple Dr's, need advice or thoughts, previously healthy Hello! Just wanted to make a post and share my situation in the hopes that someone could provide further insight. I was a generally healthy 24-year-old, Caucasian young man. I am and have always been on the slim side, weigh about 66kg and am 5'10. Prior to onset of symptoms was active (played tennis, soccer, biked) had a very good diet, did not consume drugs or smoke and only drank casually a few times per month. Some history of heart disease on my dad's side, his dad died of cardiac arrest when he was 50 (was a heavy smoker and drinker). I have gone to the emergency room multiple times in the past year with a rapid heart rate and sensation of strong heart beating, associated with chest pressure as well as left arm pain and back pain and a pounding headache. I am now finding that my exertional capacity has diminished significantly and I have had to quit my job.  I have very frequent episodes of rapid episodes of heart beating, as well as daily episodes of ""strong"" heart beating, air hunger and significant tightness and discomfort in my chest, although these may not occur simultaneously.  The chest discomfort and pounding sensation is quite constant and can radiate to my back, into my arms, and is generally made worse when standing/walking.

I have been to see two separate cardiologists and have had multiple Holter monitors (2-3 and 14 days) with no significant abnormalities other than some sinus tachycardia, had an echo study done in February and have had two ECG stress test completed, both of which I had to stop around the 9-10 minute mark because of worsening symptoms, but there were no noted ECG changes other than some tachycardia again. BP is normal. One of the cardiologists put me on a low dose beta-blocker (bisopropol fumurate) to try and reduce some of the rapid heart beating. This has helped somewhat, but the strong pounding, tightness and pressure still persist and are becoming increasingly debilitating. Have had my thyroid function checked this was normal. No other abnormalities in my blood work. Pulmonary function test did reveal some mild asthma but otherwise okay. I even went to see a psychiatrist because one clinician thought it could be anxiety related, but the psych was quite adamant that she did not believe this was the case.

The symptoms are only getting worse from month to month, and none of my physicians seem to have an idea what to pursue next.

Main complaint: I recently had a new sexual partner. He had STD testing done for everything at a planned parenthood. He was asymptomatic but received 1 g of azythromicin empirically at time of testing and told to abstain from sex for 7 days and his results would be back in 1 week. I have never had an STD in my life so I am very anxious about all of this. I stupidly had sex with him (without a condom) the night before it would have been the 7th day of treatment (we did this around 7pm Thursday night oct 17 he received the Zithromax oct 11 at 8 am). The next day after we had sex (which is the 1 week mark that they said his results would be back) he calls me that his results came back positive for chlamydia.  I immediately went to an urgent care to get tested and treated the same day. I was also given 1 g of Zithromax. 
Basically, I know that I’ll be fine since I got the dose of Zithromax. But what are the chances that I even contracted it because we had sex about 12 hours before it would have been the official 7th day of abstaining from sex, as the PA he saw told him to?

"spotting when pregnant- really need answers please White female, 31, currently pregnant, 163cm, 63 kilos, non smoker.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently 11 weeks pregnant and experienced spotting on and off until week 7- had 2 scans, the last one being a month ago showing a strong heartbeat and perfect measurements. At the time the hospital said that the spotting was nothing to worry about, my midwife on the other hand was very panicky about it and encouraged me to get a scan every time I spot.  The spotting has stopped for 4 weeks now, but this morning when I woke up after my first lie in in ages there was a tiny bit of pink on the toilet paper- and then nothing the rest of the day, no pain, nothing. The spotting is always, always first thing when I wake up - and then it disappears. One day only it came after a bowel movement. I'm on pelvic rest so not having any sex just in case. 

The hospital told me to only worry and come back if I was filling a pad and bleeding heavily, but they could not find any reason why I was spotting. They said perhaps it could be linked to my cervical ectropion. I am just very interested to see if any of you could give me some more info on this- if it was an hematoma, I assume it would have been picked up on the scans? As it is always when I get up, surely it has something to do with the lying down position?  I'm trying to sleep on my side to avoid sleeping on my belly and applying any pressure on my cervix, but maybe it's silly?

Finally- shall I worry about a possible miscarriage still now that I'm finally reaching 12 weeks and heartbeat was strong? Some doctors told me that the spotting did not increase my miscarriages risk, others said it did.

Twice it has occurred at night. Then I nap for a few hours and feel fine. This happens every 5 to 9 days. Sometimes it is projectile vomiting other times it is just bile. Previously I had a bit of constipation once a week, but I have since been taking Restoralax and am having easy bowel movements once or twice a day. Some occasional heartburn.

"Urinary and Penile Issues &amp;#x200B;

28M

Height 6'0

Weight 155lbs

Medications: Sildenafil

Do not smoke or take drugs

Only medical issue

3 years pelvic region 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Ive been having this problems for over 3 years now. It has gotten steadily worse.

My symptoms are:

Erectile dysfunction. I cannot achieve erection unless taking over 100mg sildenafil.

Pain with ejaculation. On occasion I have ejaculated blood in semen.

Penis is painful to touch and is ""smaller"" than it used to be when flaccid. (I know people are hypochondriac about this, but this is the truth. It feels 'tight' and uncomfortable. than i remember in the years before i developed these issues)

Testicles swell up and feel hard sometimes, this is when most discomfort occurs. Usually helped by hot bath and they return to normal size.

Constant ache and feeling of fullness below base of penis that is temporary relieved with ejaculation. If i go more than a day without ejaculating, it becomes unbearably painful.

Poor urinary flow.

Taking sildenafil(viagra) temporary relieves these symptoms. Everything feels like normal until the effects wear off. Unfortunately taking 100mg sildenafil gives me headaches and blurs vision and thus is not a proper solution for day-to-day. Only take it for sex. After taking sildenafil my testicles shrink to their normal size and no longer feel uncomfortably swollen.  This return to normality lasts around half a day

==========================

Reduced urinary flow and erectile dysfunction started slightly over 3 years ago. Approx. 1.5 years ago the chronic pain and discomfort started.

Sometimes it feels like reduced blood flow to the region? My penis often feels ""cold"" and shrunken. Not like how I remember it just a few years ago.

One year ago I did see a urologist and he checked my prostate and said it was of normal size, however, I had masturbated to ejaculation right before seeing him so maybe the reduced semen volume led to a misdiagnosis? I was however retaining urine in my bladder after urinating, which caused it to be inflamed. I was put on a course of ciprofloxacin, flomax. Did not relieve symptoms.

I can no longer afford to see a urologist. I am at a loss for help. Are there exercises or supplements that would help? Has anyone experienced this?",AskDocs,t3_dksjsa
"Need Advice- Any nutritionists here? found out I’m pre-diabetic, need help Need Advice

Hey guys, I’m (23yo, 5ft. 9in., 265lbs) trying to make some changes toward a healthier lifestyle. I just found out recently I’m pre-diabetic (it’s likely I have been undiagnosed for a long time). I know that diagnosis isn’t necessarily a life sentence but I want to stop it and work on correcting it before it becomes permanent and progresses to diabetes. My father has diabetes that runs in his family and my mom has insulin resistance and thyroid problems that run in hers So I know I’m probably more prone to these problems but working on not letting that happen. I’ve been given a chance by catching this early and I need some direction as it seems to have gotten worse at my A1C 3 month check up. My metabolism is very low and I can go days without eating or feeling hunger (it’s improved a little bit more recently). I’ve seen a nutritionist and have been doing okay with the Mediterranean diet, and I was seeing a personal trainer who I stopped seeing recently because she was just not a good fit for me as she motivated her clients with insults and guilting them and I need positive motivation. 

My mother said I should check out a weight loss clinic like she had done in the past??? They apparently have some vitamin B injections I can take and pills (fentermine? I think it was)??? Anybody have any experience with that? I know that’s just a temporary fix, but is that something good to start with while I work on changing lifestyles?

More importantly-long term; What are some daily exercises I can start doing and incorporate into my routine? Things I can do at my desk at work?  Any idea of foods/vitamins/supplements I can start putting in my diet to help lower my A1C and burn fat?

"Heart rate stays elevated between 90-120bpm all day, no matter what I’m doing. I’m a 20 year old male, 5’9”, 138 pounds. I take 12.5mg of metoprolol 2 times a day.

Long story short, I’m trying to figure out what’s going on with my heart. As soon as I get up out of bed in the morning, my heart rate will jump up to anywhere between 90-130bpm and will not come down from there unless I sit (then tapers off into the 80s) or lay down (this is when it returns to the 60s/70s). Climbing stairs I stay around 110-120 and moving any faster than a brisk walk gets me into the 140s.

I wear a Fitbit when I go to bed and as I’m asleep my heart rate hangs around 56-64. Seems normal enough. 

I have considered POTS but I don’t have many other symptoms. I used to wake up to severe nausea pretty much daily. My blood pressure can sit a little high when my beta blocker wears off. I have talked to numerous doctors about a tilt table test but to no avail. Extensive cardiac work-up has shown that my heart and coronary arteries are in very good shape structurally.

I don’t necessarily feel palpitations until my heart goes above 120. Once in a while I feel a skipped beat.

Taking a multivitamin and multimineral with focus on magnesium has helped me with reconditioning enough to be able to return to full time work and most activity.

Hi all, hope you guys are doing well.

I bought a BP checker for home, and have been checking my BP whenever I felt like.

My systolic BP ranges something between 96-118, and diastolic BP is 61-85. Pulse is between 60 something to 80 something during whole day.

No other physical symptoms though. I have been feeling pretty good these days. I eat well, work full time, take a walk 1-2 a day without any problems.

But the pulse pressure is low, I think. For three or four days, it has been something between 27-35, and especially when I checked it soon after I wake up from bed l, the PP was 17(the BP was 100/83).

"Vertigo has taken a really big toll on my life, does anyone have any thoughts based on my story? I'm a 40 white male and have had problems with vertigo for over 10 years, but in recent times it's been taking a much bigger toll on me.  Sometimes it's positional and resembles BPPV (usually looking down/up or laying on one side or the other).  But mostly I just feel like I'm rocking on a boat all day, every day.  Or my head is bobbing on the ocean in the waves.  

Then, occasionally, I'll have these brief, very intense vertigo spells....I sometimes feel like I have a surge of electricity in my head and then some intense spinning and disorientation for maybe 1 to 4 seconds.  Just yesterday, I parked my car and was walking in a park with my kid, and it looked like the whole Earth started rocking back and forth, spinning, and the disorientation and associated anxiety hit me.  Took about 10 seconds to recover, but felt extra ""rocky"" on my feet for the next 30 mins or so.

I feel spaced out/disconnected all the time and a bad sense of smell.  I have frontal headaches.  Every once in a while, one of my ears will suddenly feel ""full"" I lose the hearing slightly and hear a ringing, then this sensations fades over the next 10 seconds.  No one understands that when I describe it to them, and sometimes I question myself too.  

A number of years ago, I saw an Oto Neurologist who did a specialized MRI and also attempted to do caloric testing (cold water in my ears).   I called off the caloric testing because it caused me to have such bad vertigo they had to stop the test before it really began.

On my MRI I have a stable 3.5 centimeter osteoma above my left eye in my skull, but everyone I've seen has insisted that lesion isn't the cause, so I've forgotten about that.

Yesterday when I got out of the shower my girlfriend said ""what the heck happened to your legs?"" I hadn't noticed it prior to that so not sure on duration, but as you can see from the photo I have some bad bruising/marks on my calves. I have not done anything physical that could've caused this - haven't hurt them and haven't done any exercise this week like jogging.

If I am wondering if I should go to to A&amp;E or wait until my doctor opens in the morning. It's not painful per se, but currently I'm feeling a bit of discomfort / tightness in the calves. If it was just one leg I'd probably brush it off but the fact it is both and in the same area is giving me some concern. Any advice from a doctor would be appreciated! Thanks.

I smoke like a pack of cigarettes a day. 
Also smoke marijuana daily. 
No medical isssues aside from history of depression and migraines. 

About 12 weeks ago i noticed a swollen lymph node on right side of neck under jaw. Its about the size of an almond, im not really sure if its gotten bigger. No pain or tenderness. At times the whole right side of my neck swells.

In the last 12 weeks I've also developed fatigue and a constant low grade fever.  (Between 99.1-100.5) 

I get chills but i also get the sweats. Like goosebumps when its 74, or sweat through my shirt from doing something simple like dishes. Its off and on. 

I have a rash or something. It looks like tiny pin prick blood spots. Theyre spread out over my arms, chest, back and even a few on my face, and few on throat and i feel like im getting more and more. But maybe i just notice more now. 

Ive noticed hair thinning as well and my nails are blue around the little moon. 

I dont have pain but occasionally discomfort in throat, like for a moment i cant swallow or just gets this full feeling on right side. I can see red purple veins all over throat and a few white spots and a purple spot on right tonsil. 

I havent been sick all year so i dont think its a virus. Anyone have any ideas what it can be? I will have an appt in early November when my insurance goes into effect.

"Worried about radiation from x-rays and CT scan 30M, 5'6"", 125lbs, caucasian.

A  few days ago I had 3 x-rays on my lumbar spine. I was supposed to have 2  x-rays: one lying on my back and another one lying on my side. The  technician told me that we had to repeat the one lying on my back,  because the image wasn't good enough for a proper diagnosis. I asked him  what happened, and he told me that we really had to repeat the x-ray,  because my body position wasn't properly aligned, and he also told me  that's something that normally happens, and so he aligned me again in  the machine by moving me around using my feet and then repeated the  test. Before doing the x-rays the technician told me I didn't have to  remove any of my clothes (even though there was a medical gown in the  dressing room), he just told me to leave everything that was metallic,  and my watch, wallet and phone in the dressing room.

Is  this normal procedure? I took the exam with my shorts and polo shirt  on. Wasn't I supposed to wear the medical gown instead? Is it normal to  have repeated the x-ray exam in these conditions? I had to do 3 lumbar  x-rays instead of 2. My doctor asked me to do these x-rays + an MRI on  my lumbar spine, because I've been having a lot of pain in my lumbar and  left leg as soon as I walk more than 10 minutes. I've been having this  pain for 4 months.

I am very  concerned about the radiation, because I also had to do a x-ray and CT  scan on my cervical spine in January of the current year, due to a lot  of pain in the back of my head and on my shoulders (I ended up being  diagnosed with cerebellum tonsils herniation). I also did one spine  x-ray in April of 2018, but in this x-ray exam I was standing. I did  this because I was also having back pain at the time and my doctor  thought I had scoliosis, but she then told me it wasn't serious.  Finally, I also did a x-ray on my hands in August of 2018, because the  joints of my fingers were very swollen, red and hurt while typing on the  keyboard.

Am I being too worried about the radiation? Did I do a lot of exams? I'm having a lot of  anxiety about of this. I'm very concerned I might have cancer in the  mid/long term because of these exams.

I had a sore throat when we left home on Wednesday, but it went away after Friday. Today is Sunday, and i woke up feeling like i had something in my throat. I looked in the mirror, and saw a white thing that i assumed was a seed or something stuck on my throat. Used my finger to wipe it away, and saw it was a clump of white hard mushy-ish stuff that smelled like bad breath. (Had never seen anything like it)

I looked again and saw a little hole where it had been, on the right of my throat, close to my uvula. (Ehat im guessing is one of the tonsils?)
I poked it a bit to see what it was, and drained a bunch more of the white hard stuff out (maybe puss? Ive never seen puss HARD before).

Its the only spot like that. Its just a little hole now, no more puss. But it really freaked me out. 
My throat hurts again. And the spot in my throat with the little hole hurts the most.
Otherwise im fine. Ive had a stomach ache (could just be from the travelling) and i feel tired, but i don’t have a fever, and i can breathe normally.

I googled it, and it looks like something called a Peritonsillar Abscess. (I usually go straight to the doctor, but we are on vacation and there aren’t many docs available here).

Few days later, it felt like UTI because I had frequent urge to pee and it would burn a little, but there’s only a bit of blood coming out. The bleeding stopped, but there my frequent urge to pee kept going, tho there’s no burning feeling/pain anymore.

The next month, september, I didn’t have my period. Btw i have irregular cycles. Then today, my urethra began to bleed again like it was my period. At first i thought it was passing thru my vagina but earlier I saw blood clot coming out as I was peeing.

"Tachycardia, especially while standing, more likely after drinking alcohol. I am a white male, 28 years old, 6ft tall and 185lbs, non-smoker but I use dipping tobacco daily. For several years I have noticed a relatively fast heart rate and recently I got a Fitbit and have been keeping a closer eye on it. Fitbit says my resting heart rate is around 63-69bpm (usually only this low while I’m sleeping or just after waking up), this usually increases to around 85-100bpm when sitting, 95-115bpm while standing and 110-120bpm while walking. However, sometimes it will be around 80-100 when I’m laying down resting and go up to 145 or even 165 when I stand up (but am not walking or exercising or anything). I don’t really notice other symptoms when my heart rate is going this fast, other than being annoyed by the fast heart rate itself. My pulse feels regular but fast to me when I check it. Triggers for this type of fast heart rate while just standing seem to be consuming alcohol (or the day after drinking) even if I only have around 5 or 6 alcoholic drinks, though sometimes there’s no obvious trigger. I used to have anxiety, which I’ve learned to control through daily meditation and treating my adhd properly, but I still have a fast heart rate, I’m just not anxious about it. This makes me think that the heart rate might not be anxiety related as I previously thought, especially considering I’m not anxious at all after a few drinks but it still happens. About 3 or 4 years ago I went to the doctor and had a stress test, echocardiogram and wore a heart monitor for 48 hours. The results came back normal, however I didn’t drink any alcohol during that time and on the days I wore the monitor my heart felt totally normal. I’ve heard of POTS and think that I could possibly fit that diagnoses, in which case I’ll just try to improve my cardiovascular fitness and not worry about it. I am just wondering if this type of occasional increase in heart rate can be considered normal (or at least not a cause for concern after a couple drinks) or if I should go back to the doctor. Is there any way I could have developed a new arrhythmia in the last few years or had one all along that wasn’t picked up on the tests before? Would the stress test/echocardiogram have picked up any electrical problems with my heart? I take 30mg Vyvanse daily for adhd but I’m 100% sure that this medication isn’t the cause of my tachycardia as I noticed it well before I started the meds and its just as likely to happen on days where I don’t take it. 

TLDR; heart rate occasionally goes to 165bpm while simply standing up, a few alcoholic drinks makes this quite likely to happen. Is this reason enough to go back to the doctor and have my heart checked again or should I stop worrying about it and just try to improve my cardio and limit alcohol intake?",AskDocs,t3_dko5lc
"Knee injury post ACL reconstruction 29M, 6’2”, 260, Caucasian. No drinking since incident. No smoking, drugs at all.

Tore my ACL, MCL and meniscus at the age of 14 playing American football. Had reconstructive surgery at age 16. Went back to contact sports within a few months.

Aside from knowing when storms are coming, I’ve had no issues until squatting at work, hearing a loud pop and having instant swelling, pain and bruising at the end of July.

I was referred to an orthopaedic specialist by the urgent care facility I visited the day of the incident.  On my first visit, the doctor made note of the lasting bruise, swelling and buckling while walking. The insurance company sent me to their facility for an MRI, which the doctor said was of subpar quality. I was sent for physical therapy to ‘focus on pain management.’ I was then sent for a second MRI, the results showing excessive fluid, arthritis and damage to the graft.

On my most recent visit, the insurance company had sent a case manager to sit in on the visit. The doctor now says that ‘nothing is wrong,’ despite the inflammation, bruising, pain and buckling still being present three months later. I have been taking maximum doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen to deal with pain since the day of the incident.

They opted to continue physical therapy, but are not offering insight on what the true issue is. What could be leading to the inflammation, bruising and buckling still being present after so long? How do I move forward to pursue a permanent fix rather than a temporary band-aid? Is there anything I can be doing different to better this situation?

I'm looking to find out if any doctors have seen something like this. A week ago i took the last of a bottle of Nutri Thyroid, an apparently hormone free thyroid glandular supplement. This was recommended by a naturopath who said my test numbers were sub-clinical. Two hours after taking the final dose I was sitting in bed watching a music video when my HR shot up to about 154bpm out of nowhere and I got bad chest pains. Called an ambulance, ECG fine, so no hospital stay. Since then I had developed surges of anxiety and high HR, hair thinning/loss, leg cramps and hot flashes. I've also had irregular periods since I started the supplement, skipped one and current cycle is late. Are these freeze dried thyroid supplements truly hormone free? Could they have caused this?

50mg phenagren every 8 prn chronic nausea

Cause of chronic nausea unknown

Friday around 230am I had a stroke, it didn't show up on CT or CTA but the MRI w/contrast confirmed the stroke. The MRI also showed bilateral VAD, I was told that on both sides it starts at the base and goes about halfway their length.  Stroke affected right side - arm weakness/hard to move, foot drop and dragging leg to walk, numb/pins and needles entire right side from the midline over. As well as memory (epically failed the cognitive test they gave me) as well as word searching 

My stroke symptoms randomly get a million times worse even with lovenox and plavix then just as fast go back to the baseline have atm from the stroke. Plavix dose times were noon Friday and Saturday. Lovenox dose is 120mg. Allergic to ASA so that wasnt started - neurology said might need to bring immunology in to desensitize so can be started on it  So even with meds/treatment I'm having TIA's. I was under the impression Plavix started lowering TIA/stroke risk after about 3 hours and lovenox 4 hours with therapeutic levels being reached after 3 doses - So is it normal still symptomatic and having frequent TIA'S?

When Neurology came in I was told diagnosis and that from the scan they looked stable so approach that will be most likely is rescan in 2-3 weeks to see if healing has started and if so monitor closely that healing if not stent. No known event to trigger and neurology suspects and undiagnosed under lying condition is at the root given I'm diagnosed with POTS and Mast Cell Activation Disorder/Syndrome. Also have primary adrenal insufficiency (negative for autoimmune cause on  3 antibodies tests) and have a hx of torn ligaments two to the point reconstruction needed. Hx of saddle PE unprovoked/no known cause August 2016, AC therapy for a year then off as all hematological testing normal. Also have had a DVT cause complication of PICC line during pregnancy, PICC was for treating hyper emesis.

 How is it stable if I'm been having TIA's since the initial stroke with meds? Like so many TIA's I've lost count.

I've been low blood pressures (one I remember was 110/49 last one 108/56) and resting heart rate around 100-110 - I rest a tad high typically at 90-100 so only slightly off my norm  (once the ER got it down and I was transfer to a room I was over 200 in the ambulance). Around 11am Saturday morning it shot up to averaging 140 with jumps as high as 200 with strings of PVCs, ekg done confirming sinus tachycardia. 2 doses of an IV med to bring it down - the m beta blocker forgive me I cant remember its name keep word searching on it (and many words) and an oral dose of same med it stubbornly absolutely refused to budge any and go down. They were limited on how much of the beta blocker they could give me in fear of dropping my blood pressure. This got me transferred to Cardiac PCU around 7pm.

After 3 hours later they finally got it to a more tolerable rate in the 120s and I fell asleep about midnight. Cardiac PCU used the same med but in smaller frequent doses to achieve heart rate decreases but not cross the to much for my blood pressure and have it go even lower.

Wake up around 5 - heart racing, feels like going to jump out of my chest, rate fluctuating lightning fast between 130 to 170. Up then down then stay in the 160s then down then back up constantly big swings. Neck also hurts a TON worse then went to sleep went from 5-9 on a 0-10 scale and severe nausea. Nurses get it back down with same approach and fluids.

No one has commented on why it's so crazy high just that cardiology was called to consult.

So now I'm awake  on less then 5 hours sleep watch the monitor cause it occasionally beeps and flashes yellow/red cause even with the beta blocker it's going above their parameters sometimes. That's when I noticed it, My jump in heart rate is a direct relation to how I'm sitting/laying and the angle my shoulders and neck is at. The pain is causing major nausea.

Cardiology hasn't seen me yet just my telemetry and written orders.

To my non-medical professional self my theory on that is going on with heart rate is the amount of occlusion on both sides is significant enough to be stressing my heart leading to the tachycardia and as long as simply treated with medication therapy the tachycardia is going to remain. Neurology pulled in Neurovascular for consult. I'm worried my logic is correct and today at rounds the game plan is going to change to the stent surgery urgently vs seeing if heal on own as they said most do. I don't want to be blindsided though so would this be a logical approach to expect presented to me today? If not what are your thoughts on what's going on and what I can expect the next few days? 

I've attached the one image of my MRI I have. The neurology yesterday said that on both sides it starts at the base of my arteries around the shoulder and the dissections stop somewhere roughly around ear level/rough half the length of the arteries. The left side is the worst as its completely occluded in spots, the right side he said is pretty much that level of blockage for the length of it with two places a little wider. 
(Nevermind it won't let me put the pic I'll try in comments otherwise message me and I can send that way) The right is a small pin point of black

People have been telling I snore crazy loud for a few year (and my roommate took a video of it a few years ago — it sounded awful, like I was being choked), but for the past month or so (or maybe longer and I'm just starting to notice it more?), I've started to feel tired throughout the day.

I usually take 20xr (went down to 15xr for past few months but just moved back up to 20xr bc the aforementioned trouble focusing/staying awake). Some of the tiredness probably comes from anxiety (I take 5mg Lexapro daily) but this seems like something more.

"What do I do with a mom who doesn't believe in doctors? (16F) I know this isn't the usual type of post that's in this subreddit, but please don't take down my post, mods... Or if there's a better subreddit for this sort of question, please let me know. 

Anyways, anytime I feel something is wrong, my mom brushes it off and gives me the most random/useless advice. She doesn't ever take me to see a doctor unless I ask her a dozen times for a single visit, but even that doesn't always guarantee a visit.

Some examples of my mom brushing things off are I once had diarrhea and unpleasant stomach aches for 8 days in a row despite there being no change in my usual diet, but my mom said to just drink water. Also, I've been constipated my entire life, but my mom says it's because I don't eat enough vegetables even though I do eat them, am not a picky eater, and no one else in the family deals with constant constipation. I asked her to take me to a doctor, and she did. The doctor recommended fibre in a powder form, but that didn't help. I asked my mom to take me again, but she then just told me to drink tea. 

The problems I've been dealing with have mostly either been an ongoing problem for the past fee years or my entire life is my knee and elbow joints shifting out of place, constipation like I've mentioned, emetophobia, a constant feeling of tiredness and fogginess (though it may be because of my depression) and some mental illnesses such as depression, social anxiety, and an eating disorder. I don't think what I'm dealing with is anything extremely alarming that needs to be dealt with ASAP, but it would be nice to have these problems solved. 

I know I can go to the family doctor myself because I'm 16 for crying out loud, but my social anxiety makes it mentally difficult and extremely stressful to book an appointment myself and go there myself which is why I'd like someone, preferably my mom, to help me out, but she doesn't take my concerns seriously which had lead to problems piling up over the years.

Everything came back ok. So they said I must just have a virus that’s effecting my respiratory system — a “respiratory virus” 

My lungs feel a bit better 2 days later so they may be right but...

I’m still worried cuz I still feel “virused up” in my lungs and because of how it’s effected my breathing kinda (it’s kinda made me anxious as I already take anti depressants for anxiety too) I’m still worried I’m ok ONLY because I’ve never had a virus before that effects you in this way?

A long-term IBS-D, SIBO, Candida sufferer here. For many years I have struggled with bloating, excessive intestinal gas, cramps, abdominal discomfort/pain, physical weakness, brain fog and so on after virtually every meal (no matter what I ate). 

Recently I started drinking a glass of red wine before/during my meals and it seems to alleviate 90-100% of my symptoms. First I attributed this effect to the chemical compounds found in wine. Then I decided to try some alcohol-free wine to test my theory and see if it had the same effect. My symptoms were back! Therefore, it simply has to be the alcohol in wine that alleviates my symptoms.

A little bit of further research revealed that red wine is a strong stimulant of gastric acid secretion and gastrin release. Does this mean my stomach is deficient in stomach acid?

This will likely be lengthy but I would be beyond grateful if someone can help me in any way. 
Tldr: I haven't eaten in a week and feel nauseous af, help! 

I am a 20 yo female, caucasian and I live in Europe. I have a history of feeling nauseous quite often, and apparently polycystic ovaries. I also have some mental issues for sure, but I have only just gotten a psychological test done and won't be seeing a psychiatrist until next month. My issues have mostly to do with anxiety, depression, and poor emotion control. I also smoke weed, but haven't done so since my troubles started last week.

Now on to the issue.

I haven't eaten a proper meal since last Tuesday. On Wednesday I woke up early for college, had some coffee, and left the house. I realized I don't feel well on my commute but since I have a history of feeling sick, and I have been slightly nauseous daily since college started, I didn't pay much attention to it. I started worrying when I literally couldn't swallow a bite of a pastry I bought that I usually quite like. I ended up leaving college early that day and going home, hoping it passes.
It didn't.

In the following days I visited my doctor, who upon reading my psych evaluation said it was in my head bc I'm stressed and to go home, relax, and eat.
The next day I also went to my gynecologist. She did a vaginal ultrasound and yet again sent me on my way, saying it's polycystic ovaries.
Now, my last period was 3rd-10th October and I had sex with my bf on the 2nd and the 10th. Of course, I'm horrified of being pregnant because I can't think of anything else that would cause me to feel this way for this long.

Other than the nausea, my hands and feet are sweaty and cold but that could just be from not eating. My breasts feel slightly larger than usual but they don't hurt at all. And I had pains in my ovaries last night that somewhat persist into today. I also have some back pain. 

Today, I've been trying to eat 1 mashed banana and 1 mashed apple mixed together for 5 hours now. I feel full after every bite, and have diarrhea after approx every 5 bites. I'm also very weak. 
I was forced by family members to eat a tiny piece of fish with bread, which I barely managed. 

I did blood tests 2 or so months ago and they came back perfectly healthy, only my red cell count was slightly elevated.
My mother thinks I should just force myself to eat, but when I try it feels like I'm already full and if I keep forcing myself I just feel more nauseous. I have been drinking ginger and chamomile tea.

"Very delayed sore throat after cold So I had what I think was a normal cold last weekend, it started with me having a bit of a funny feeling in my throat on last week's Wednesday, which then progressed into a completely blocked nose as well as a strong headache and constantly feeling cold. The thing is, my throat never got worse than that ""funny"" feeling and even when the headache was the strongest and my nose was constantly running it kind of just went away. These symptoms all disappeared by Tuesday. Now I didn't take any medication against this because I figured it would just go away on its own and I felt worst on the weekend and couldn't go to the doctor anyway. Yesterday, on Saturday, so 10 days after me initially having a funny feeling in my throat, the same feeling returned. Overnight, it progressed into a sore throat but none of the other symptoms popped up. My nose is completely free and I have no headache. Would it be possible for me to have this sore throat from the same illness that made me sick last week? In between this weeks Monday and now I worked out pretty heavily because I felt fine again, maybe this exacerbated things somehow? I did have some pretty poor performances on some lifts and felt dizzy every now and then, but I attributed this to being out of the gym for a week rather than having some kind of dormant form of the cold. I'm asking this question more out of curiosity, it seems like kind of a difficult one to google.

"(20M) Irritated rough patches around anus So last Wednesday I woke up with some irritation around my anus. There’s not much to tell about it, just that it started happening and has gotten worse. I’ve taken pictures on Friday, Saturday, and this morning so you can see the difference:

https://imgur.com/a/HrbfWjw

The patches are raw and kind of bumpy. It hurts to walk. I’ve gotten some hydrocortisone cream to try and help but I don’t think it has.

I have been seeing someone (22M) for the past few months (since August) and we’ve had unprotected sex for the majority of that time. So there has been increased activity in that area, as well as douching before meeting sometimes. I’ve asked if he has any STDs/STIs and he says no, that it would be impossible. 

Could it be STD-related if I haven’t had sex with anyone else? Could I have come in contact with an irritant? Should I seek professional medical help for this?",AskDocs,t3_dkjk0w

"Had a bad experience getting my first IUD inserted. Completely lost confidence in the nurse that did it. Now I'm unsure whether how much of my (23F) bleeding is normal. I am Canadian, 23F, have never had children, never been pregnant nor had an abortion, regular periods that are a little on the heavy side. On Friday, I had a Copper IUD (the Mona Lisa 5 Standard) inserted by a nurse practitioner at my doctor's office. My doctor was on holidays. 

Background to why I chose a copper IUD: After a 4 month stint using hormonal birth control (the lowest dosage possible on the market) I got almost every single negative side effect you could get for using it. I didn't have a single period the entire time. Severe depression, racing heartbeat, weight gain, extreme mood swings, dry hair, I developed an anxiety disorder accompanied by panic attacks, sore breasts, swelling ankles. We didn't expect it was the pill at first, we just thought I was going crazy. 

I was becoming a danger to myself and there was talk of having me admitted somewhere. I couldn't do my job, despite rigorous cognitive behavioural therapy, and I had to be put on medical leave from work until I sorted myself out. I forgot to take my pill one day and in a mood-swinged panic, which was common for me at the time, I called my boyfriend hysterical. He suggested that it might be the birth control and said that for now it might be better if I stopped taking it. Just to see if it made a difference. So I did. 

4 days later, I was anxiety free. 2 weeks later, I still had some concentration issues but for the most part I was back to normal. My therapist noted this without prompting when I went to see her. 4 weeks later I was back to work like nothing had happened. 6 weeks later and here we are!

Since that pill was the lowest dosage, I became extremely wary of hormonal birth control in any form. My GP (I love her a lot) was really great about talking to me about all the forms of birth control out there. We eventually decided on a copper IUD. I was nervous about having the device inserted, but my doctor answered all of mine and my BFs questions. She made us feel very comfortable with the idea but made sure I knew the risks and what to expect afterwards. But that was two weeks ago and I didn't take notes...I also have questions I hadn't thought of at the time. 

The nurse destroyed my confidence: the nurse that inserted it was a complete air-head. She had never inserted a copper one before, so she made a big deal about it, even going so far as to act irritated with me for not choosing the Mirena. She flicked through the physician instruction pamphlet before 'uggh'-ing at me because 'theres like a million instructions here' and said she was going to talk to the clinic's other doctor (since mine was on holiday). She slammed the door on her way out and left me sitting there for a really long time. The confidence my doctor had built for the procedure crumbled the longer I sat there. I kept telling myself that it couldn't be that different of an insertion from the Mirena, so I'm sure the nurse would be just fine. I just had to stay calm and not over-react. By the time she came back I'd almost cried and walked out twice. During the procedure she kept saying things like 'lets try this' or 'hmmmm I can't get through' or 'thats not right'. I'm pretty sure I've had my cervix clamped open before and I know it doesn't feel great but DAMN DID IT HURT. I have high pain tolerance and I screamed a bit when she did it. Then at the end of the proceedures, when I tried to ask about how to check and make sure it was in place or how much bleeding I should have, she dismissed my questions. Handed me a maxi-pad and told me to have a good day. 

So yeah, she completely shattered my confidence. 

The amount of blood I'm having I would describe as 'heavy spotting'. Over the course of 24 hours, I will need to change the pad I've been using (which are regular) twice. I have not been having any pain or cramping since yesterday morning.

I want to know: how long is this heavy spotting supposed to last? When I google it, it says to expect spotting for 3-6 months but what I'm experiencing is not typical 'spotting' like the website describes. I've read almost everything I can find online but nothing answers my exact question. 

Also, do you know if I would be able to have a gynecologist take my IUD out when the time comes? Can or will gynecologists do that? I've never been to one before (my doctor has done all my paps etc.) but I'm going to be making an appointment with my doctor when she gets back and I'd like to discuss the possibility of getting referred to a gynecologist when it needs to come out. 

My IUD will last 5 years but my BF and I are looking at children in about 3 so having it taken out is already on my mind. Especially since I REALLY don't want to have it done at my clinic again.",AskDocs,t3_dki94k

I've been through 2 rounds of doxy resulting in temporary relief. I havent been re-tested because I recently lost my insurance but the burning sensation has returned. So I'm assuming I at least still have UU.

"Chronic Undiagnosed Toe Pain My boyfriend is 32 years old and has had chronic toe pain for over a year. We’ve been to three different podiatrists, all of which have taken xrays and sent us home with no answers. Podiatrists couldn’t see any obvious cause of the pain. 

The pain is debilitating most days, it’s primarily in his right foot and radiates between mostly the three big toes and the outer portion of his foot.  It doesn’t get worse with use, it starts as soon as he wakes up in the morning and oftentimes wakes him up while sleeping at night. 

Recently, the big toe started turning purple for a week at a time. It’ll turn purple, he can barely walk on it, then a week later the purple goes away, but the pain is still there. That’s happened twice. 

The only prescription he takes is 20 mg of Adderall twice a day for his ADHD and mass quantities of acetaminophen... he is otherwise, healthy. 

He’s been to a GP, who did blood work and it came back normal. GP has no suggestions either.

At this point, he’s been living with the pain for a year and it’s affected his ability to cope with life. The pain is constant and causes him to be short tempered, rude, he can’t focus at work, he’s just overall not himself, but we can’t get answers on what’s going on.

Unfortunately, this means my only option for treatment locally would be at the hospital down the road.

I may workout harder than i should, but not a single one of these sites of pain came from any known incident.

I’m having pain in the right side of my neck, made worse by tilting my head to the right, and turning my head to the right. I also have a lump right around where the pain is, which I’ve seen a doctor about in the past as it’s been there for years. It hasn’t gotten any bigger, and the doctor said it was too close to nerves to safely remove.

Secondly, I’m having pain just to the right of my thoracic region in my back, kind of in between the spine and the shoulder blade. It hurts to breathe in deeply, and hurts even worse to breathe in deeply while laying down. I have not seen a doctor about this. 

Thirdly, i’m having chronic lower back pain that won’t subside even with stretching of the hamstrings, quads, and hip flexors. And foam rolling my glutes, lower back, and upper back.

I’m also having a weird pain on the inside of my elbow after workouts, if I flex my bicep it’ll seize up and lock my forearm against my upper arm. 

Lastly, I’m having lateral side knee pain randomly, and the joint feels slightly unstable when this pain occurs.

Writing this out makes me annoyed because of just how much is happening all at the same time with no discernible cause. I can’t even get a good nights rest at this point because of it and it’s beginning to effect my performance academically.

Cut to the next day, I woke up and it felt like there was something  stuck on a small portion of my arm, kind of like a sticker, except there was nothing on it and it was quite numb when I tried to “rub it off” I thought it was strange but it didn’t hinder my everyday activities, so again I just brushed it off. 

But now today, the burning/tingling sensation is completely back in my arm and it’s pretty much stopping me from doing any form of activity. Anytime I straighten my arm, put any weight on it, lift something, (even something as light and picking my blanket up off me) pet my cat, rest my arm/let it hang to my side, turn a door handle, pretty much anything that requires any muscle strength. It’s a non-stop burning/tingling pain that just will not go away no matter what I do. Whenever I run my finger along where it’s burning/tingling it’s almost completely numb and I can barely feel my finger touching. The only thing I can feel is the burning/tingling sensation throughout my arm and fingers. 

I have brought this up to various family members and they’ve brushed it off as a blown vein, not to worry and that it should be ok in a few days. But Is it just that? Or is it something more serious? Did she blow through my vein or did she nick my nerve and cause some type of damage? Please help. Thank you.

"I've been having Helicobacter Pylori for 10 years: am I at risk of stomach cancer? Hello, I'm a guy in his early 30s. About 10 years ago I had chronic nausea, so I went to my doctor. After an EGD, it turned out I had an Helicobacter Pylori infection that caused a mild chronic gastritis.

I'm allergic to antibiotics so I couldn't do the triple therapy for the HP, but I tried some natural remedies (mastic gum, black garlic, aloe vera and other stuffs) that worked really well and after a few weeks my symptoms were completely gone even though the HP was still there (I did another test later).

Since then I had no stomach issues at all for 10 years, until now. For the past 2-3 months I've been experiencing an uncomfortable sensation after eating, and sometimes also a burning/painful sensation if I eat something spicy or acidic. No loss of appetite, no weight loss, no nausea, just an uncomfortable sensation after I eat that sometimes lasts up to 1-2 hours. Sometimes I don't feel anything though, it doesn't happen after every meal.

Since HP is apparently linked to stomach cancer, do you think I should do another EGD? Or could it just be a regular gastritis?

Hi all, I've [posted here before](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/dgmbxv/im_22_and_my_doctor_found_elevated_liver_function/) about my pcp finding very elevated AST, ALT and ALP levels in routine bloodwork - I do not have the exact numbers, but she said they are normally in the 30s but mine were in the 400s, with nothing else abnormal and no symptoms. She ordered a CT scan and told me to not take tylenol (which I did occassionally). Well, over 2 weeks have passed since I got my bloodwork done. I went to the ER tonight for some side pain (which went away while in the ER, they couldn't find an explanation so it could have been a physical manifestation of my anxiety) and the doctor decided to do the bloodwork again and do the CT then instead of waiting for my appointment this coming Wednesday. 

My ALT is at 78 u/L, my AST is 30 u/L, and my ALP is at 107 u/L. According to the report these are all ""normal."" Everything else is normal except I have mildly elevated total protein (whatever that is) at 8.8 g/dL. The CT scan report is copied and pasted below:

Automated exposure control (AEC) was utilized. Number of images provided at the time of dictation is: 3 FINDINGS: The upper abdominal solid organs are unremarkable. There is no retroperitoneal adenopathy. There is no bowel obstruction or free air. There is no ascites. There is no appendicitis or diverticulitis. 2.5 cm left adnexal cyst. Mild free pelvic fluid.

The lung bases are clear. There are no destructive bone lesions identified. IMPRESSION: 2.5 cm left adnexal cyst. Mild free pelvic fluid. Correlate with pelvic ultrasound. Individualized dose optimization techniques were used for this CT.*

History of Endometriosis, anxiety, depression, RRF

Greetings. On February the 8th I was officially diagnosed with Endometriosis via excision. My pain was fairly mild, but enough to cause me inconvenience in my day to day life. My doctor straight away suggested Endometriosis and got me into a gynaecologist who got me in to a laporoscopy a couple of months later. He found three benign cysts and a “very mild amount” of Endometriosis, he says. It was only found on my ovaries. Months had gone by. The first three months everything seemed... okay. My pain was not getting better, and actually felt worse since the day of my operation. My pain was around a 5 or more every day. 

My pain remained a stable 5 a couple of days every week, until the last four months where things rapidly got a lot worse. In May, I tested positive on three pregnancy tests, the next day it was negative. Doctors or hospitals couldn’t tell me why. My period is completely out of whack and extremely heavy. I pass clots that are roughly 1” in diameter and my periods can last up to 8 days. This is a first for me. Additionally, I’m in so much fucking pain. 

I always read about people with endometriosis who get flare ups that basically cripple them. They end up in a ball and can’t move. I was always so grateful that I never experienced that, but now I am. My pain radiates from either side of my uterus (I’m assuming from one ovary to the other) and then into my hips, my lower back and down my thighs. The pain is so bad that I sometimes feel like I’m actually dying. 

For pain relief, I was taking tramadol for some time, but didn’t enjoy the side effects. Then I was on thc which worked great in short bursts. The best thing I’ve found is a heat pack. But relieving my pain is just a patch up. I want to know why this is happening to me and my GP, who has been so incredible in the past, will not take further action until we reach the 12 month mark.

Existing medical issues: none  
Current medications and doses: 1,500,000 IU Penicillin every Friday  
Drinking: no, I haven't had any alcohol at all since starting the treatment (was drinking socially before)  
Smoking: I have stopped smoking in February this year. Prior to this, I have been smoking for about 9-10 years  
Recreational drugs: no

Result (ASO) | Date (DD.MM.YYYY) | Notes  
200    | 23.02.2016 |  
&lt;200  | 21.11.2017 | I guess this lab doesn't differentiate if &lt;200. That's exactly what it's written on the page.

531    | 18.10.2019 |

Also, on 07.05.2019 they took a throat sample (no idea how it's called in English, the one where they use a cotton swab to collect stuff from inside the throat). Everything turned negative from this test.

The above table has all the ASO lab results extracted from all the records I have. They are from different labs across the city, depending on where I happened to have errands to run in that respective morning. Eventually, I found a lab I really like, so the last 3 results (573, 455, 531; except the 360.2 from the day I went to an extra lab) are from the same lab.

On 03.05.2019 (Friday) I started the treatment. I was prescribed an antibiotic that is called Moldamin. As far as I can tell, it contains 1,500,000 IU of Penicillin. I have been going to the hospital to get my shot every Friday (sometimes I would miss Friday, so I would go on Saturday morning). This Friday (18.10.2019) was my 24th shot.

I have been communicating with the same ENT doctor ever since I got the first out-of-bounds result on 25.04.2019. Every time I reported new lab results, she just told me to continue the treatment. Next week I am going to see her again (have been talking on the phone until now since I was prescribed the treatment), she said she wants to re-run the throat sample test.

I don't know if this is helpful at all, but I also looked through some PANDAS fact sheets/resources online. I have indeed noticed that my OCD was worse in the past year or so, and it's getting harder for me to control it. I have always had a bit of an OCD problem, but only in the past 1-2 years have I found myself opening and closing the wardrobe for more than 15 minutes and not being able to snap out of it. I'm not at the point where it's interfering with my daily activities, but I still hope it will get better and that it's related to this.

Hey guys, about a week and a half ago I believe I got gastritis. I went to the doctors to take a stool test &amp; it came back as negative for H Pylori, so I know it’s not a bacterial infection.

I was sick about 2 weeks ago. Cough,Sore Throat, Runny Nose. Now I’m feeling better except I’m still very mucusy. The cause for concern is every morning, and sometimes in the middle of the night I feel the mucus draining and bubbling In my throat. So I have to cough it up and when I do it’s all dark red and bloody looking. It also tastes really bad. Leaves a really nasty taste in my throat. It only appears that way in the morning. Throughout the day when I spit up the mucus it’s just greenish or yellow. It has been bloody in the morning for about a week now. A little less. 

I went to the urgent care a couple days ago to get it checked out. I was concerned I had a lung infection or something. Especially after some googling of my symptoms. The doctor listened to my lungs and and looked at my nose and throat. And she said my nose looked a little irritated and red inside. There was a fire very close nearby recently (Southern California, Saddleridge) and a lot of ash settled in the valley we live. She said she’s been seeing that a lot. She prescribed me some antibiotics. She said not to take them unless it continues though, she wanted to save me a trip back just in case. But she said my lungs sounded fine. She said what’s probably happening is that while I lay down and my nasal mucus drains it getting stuck in my throat and breaking down. That’s why it’s turning reddish brown. 

I just wanted to hear what some other people might think. Especially after seeing what it looked like because I took pictures of the mucus this morning. I was not able to show this to the doctor.

"Pelvic area/Prostate inflammation. It's driving me nuts! 19M, 167cm, 68kg, brown

&amp;#x200B;

Primary complaint: (pelvic area/(prostate?)) inflammation due to rigorous masturbation

Duration: \~3 years.

Any existing medical issues: all of my tendons are inflammed as well

Current medications: none.

Smoking, drinking, etc: none.

Ever since puberty (\~12yo) I started masturbating by humping the bed sheets, making the bed sheet into a ""fleshlight"". The bed sheets always put pressure on my prostate (the area between my ballsack and anus) but I was too young to care.

&amp;#x200B;

This was done daily.

&amp;#x200B;

Up to now, at 19 years old, my prostate area feels ""damaged"". In no particular order, this is what I feel:

1. The prostate area (the area between my ballsack and anus) gets inflammed. (I feel burning in the muscle in addition to the symptoms which I will specify below worsen **after** I ejaculate after masturbation.)
2. The prostate muscles feel weak and ""stretched"" all the time. I can't describe it, but the best I can say is that I feel ""**discomfort**"" in that area.
3. Contracting (squeezing) the prostate area (like kegels) is hard to do. I can't squeeze that area hard enough, always flaccidly.
4. My erection is weak.
5. Abstaining from masturbation improves my symptoms, but I can't abstain for more than 5 days.
6. When I ejaculate I feel sharp burning in my prostate area in a specific ""vein-like"" area as if the ""semen"" channel is inflammed, but post-ejaculation all of the prostate gets inflamed.

Obviously, the way I masturbate has caused this. I tried to quit masturbating like this too many times but I always fail. But ever since 2 weeks, I started masturbating ""normally"", by laying on my back and using my hands instead of external objects, but the symptoms still worsen after ejaculating although less sever.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a virgin, so there is no possibility of an STD or alike.

&amp;#x200B;

I've notified and came out to my parents about all of this. My father told me to abstain from any form of masturbating for 90 days, and after 90 days of putting no pressure on my prostate area, he will take me to an urologist.

&amp;#x200B;

Things to mention: Ever since 2 years ago all of my tendons and joints (elbow tendon, shoulder tendon, kneecaps, and heels) inflamed, as if it is tendonitis (or maybe is it?). I visited a dozen doctors for this but all of them couldn't diagnose any medical condition and all of them prescribed me anti-inflammation pills for this. They never helped but I don't take those pills anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really worried about this. Not to diagnose myself, but I googled something called ""non-bacterial prostatis"" one of it's causes is called ""nerve damage in prostate area"". Could that be me?

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone shed light on what could possibly be causing this? I am gradually quitting masturbation. I already stopped masturbating dangerously and now I do it ""normally"" I also started gradually decreasing the frequency of ejaculating, and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I will surely visit a urologist in the next 3 months. What to tell him?

On throwaway for this generally humiliating issue. I'm a young, very physically fit female. No major history of health problems. Never been pregnant. No history of UTIs. Don't smoke or use drugs. Not currently sexually active but no previous history of STDs. No other symptoms other than those described.

I've had some issues with urinary urgency for a few months now but in the last 2 or so months, urgency has become accidents. At first I would feel a strong urge try to hold, and be unable to. It would happen maybe once every few days. Now, I rarely feel an urge first and am having accidents multiple times a day. I've had very few accidents at night/while sleeping and at first only had them when I was active but am beginning to have them while sitting down, lying down, etc.

I drink alcohol very occasionally, don't really drink caffeine, citrus or anything else that would irritate my bladder. I have been restricting my fluid intake because I can't have accidents during class but am continuing to drink when I can. Often, when I have accidents, especially if they're small, it will be accompanied by a very painful burning sensation.

I had an initial appointment with a GYN who prescribed an OAB drug which I've been on for 1.5 months now with no change. I started pelvic floor PT but feel like each time I go in, I've gotten worse and have less control over my pelvic floor even though I try to do the exercises I've been given. I am unsure what my next step here is. It feels like I'm quickly losing complete control of my bladder and wish I had an idea as to why this was happening. Any recommendations for what I should be doing to address this or why this could be happening to an otherwise healthy woman?",AskDocs,t3_dk9x9l

"[28M] Decided to get tested for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia, need help determining which test is most suitable for me given my sexual history and symptoms. Please take the time to read carefully, I appreciate it. My sexual history is very brief, I received unprotected blowjobs and open-mouth kissed 3 different sex workers on 28th June, 13th August, and 24th September. The last lady on the 24th of September, I VERY briefly performed unprotected cunnilingus and analingus on her. Nothing else happened with any of them, no sexual intercourse or anything.  


My symptoms began on the 25th of September, and they have been vague, meaning, could possibly be attributed to anything other than STDs. The one symptom that concerns me the most, is a feeling in my throat I never felt before in my life. It feels like something is lodged in the back of my throat, and it very mildly affects my swallowing. It's hardly a nuisance but it's noticeable.  Besides that I still get the odd sneeze, my eyes get kinda itchy every few hours, I have low appetite, and my stool is soft.   


After a ton of research I've decided to get tested for: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Trichomoniasis, Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, EBV, and CMV.  


These tests will already cost me a fortune, but I'm willing to pay for the peace of mind.   


The issue is, I'd like to also get tested for Oral chlamydia and Oral gonorrhea, but like I said, the above is already going to cost me a fortune, so my question is, if I test negative for genital chlamydia and genital gonorrhea, is it safe to say it is highly unlikely to be found in my throat, considering the women gave me blowjobs and if they didn't pass it onto my genitals, there's no reason to think they passed it on to my throat?  


Also, what do you think of the STDs I'm planning to get tested for? Are they enough? Or am I going over the top and being a bit paranoid? I know I have that tendency for sure, I didn't have intercourse afterall.. I dont know.

"21M Intestinal parasites causing acne and hair loss I’ve been dealing with this for quite some time now. It all started around two years ago when I ate uncooked meat and got pinworms. I know this for sure because I remember waking up in the middle of the night because my butthole was itching like crazy. Also I noticed I was pooping out small thread like worms the size of a tiny pin. 

I looked up the symptoms and found that I could get rid of the parasites by taking a dose of Albendazole 400mg. So I took about a pill daily for 3 days to make sure. 

The itching went away but I kept seeing the worms in my poop. It wasn’t really affecting me directly so I didn’t really care too much about it. It didn’t really hinder my life in anyway so I didn’t pay much attention to it despite continuously pooping out worms. I figured it would naturally go away. 

A few months ago I got the itching in my butthole again so I this time I took the Albendazole 400mg pills for 10 days in a row. The itching went away again but I kept seeing the worms. I still see the worms and recently I’ve been seeing bigger worms that even look like a different kind. They are like smaller versions of earthworms almost. much thicker than the pinworms but not long at all. 

Today i pooped out so many worms like 20-30 so i freaked out. 

I put some thought and came to a big realization. 
The past year I’ve been dealing with hair loss and acne. And now i’m beginning to think that the parasites are the root causes. I’ve been doing so much and used so many products to cure my acne and hair loss but I think i’ve been looking the wrong way. 

The problem is the parasites. 
So at this point it’s not a question of if I have them or not despite my butthole itching. 
It’s how the hell i’m supposed to rid of them. I dont think taking 20 or 100 albendazole pills are going to get rid of them. So my question is how can i get rid of them forever? 

Ive been looking at fasting and seeing that it may do the trick. Should i just fast for 20 days and see if that’ll work? Should I go and see a doctor? Please help.

"27 M heart attack and stent placement, followed by another stent 4 months later and still suffering with symptoms Hi, I'm going to post a lot of information here. I really don't know where to turn. I'm hoping that I can just detail every part of my situation here and someone may be able to have some familiarity to give me some advice.

I had a heart attack almost 5 months ago at 27 years old. My symptoms were actually fairly mild. I noticed some tightening in my throat when walking and discomfort in my left arm for a couple of days. I did not get any chest pain until a few hours before I decided to go to the hospital and even then it was just a slight burn. At my age, I honestly didn't think I was having a heart attack, but I read the signs and I have a family history of it, so I decided to go to the ER. I even drove myself about an hour to get there. The doctors were ready to send me home with a heartburn diagnosis until the troponin came back and it was indeed a heart attack. They kept me there for two days until they did the angiogram and placed a stent.

Since then, I was in and out of the hospital because I got worried anytime I felt arm pain and stuff. Although, it felt similar to what I felt initially, I eventually chalked it up to just being over-worried and over analyzing the pains. I'm obviously bruising very easily with the blood thinners (effient) I am on, and I concluded that the bruising from that was causing my pain. I have no idea how accurate this is, but it gave me a little (not much) comfort. My cardiologist everytime said he didn't believe what was happening was cardiac, even when I said it felt very similar to my initial heart attack experience.

So about a month and a half to two months ago, I started feeling my throat getting tight again at random times. I can't really say it was exactly like the heart attack experience, because that was a definitive when I start exerting myself that the throat would tighten and then ease up after I relax a bit. This is a little different, it seems to definitely be started by activity, but not really exertion, for instance, I wake up in the morning and don't have it, but I can walk to the bathroom and it starts up, but it will also just remain for sometimes an hour or more. I walk every evening, and sometimes it will be there and go away mid walk, which doesn't really seem typical. It also doesn't really get more intense as more exertion happens it tends to stay at the same intensity. I've seen ENTs and they've checked my throat with both a CT scan and a scope and don't seem to see anything that concerns them from a throat perspective. I also have had my lymph nodes swollen since I've had the heart attack for an unknown reason. My cardiologist kept saying he didn't believe it was cardiac initially.

Three weeks ago it got really bad, and I also had a headache so I decided to go to the hospital, they decided to do another angiogram and I did have another stent placed for another blockage. When looking at my initial medical record, it seems they were well aware that this blockage was there. I am not sure why it wasn't stented the first time in. As scary and traumatic as this all has been I was happy to think I may have some relief now. The same day I went home from the hospital I began experiencing the throat tightness again. I went to see my cardiologist a few days later expecting him to again say he doesn't believe this is cardiac related as he always does, however this time he seemed to be more concerned or at least open to the idea that something is wrong, he is treating it like angina and gave me ranolazine which has been ineffective so far.

I don't know what to do. No one has any answers for me. I've been suffering every single day. I can't focus on anything with these symptoms still happening. My cardiologist just keeps telling me he doesn't believe things are cardiac until I am in the hospital getting stented again and even that hasn't eased my issue. In addition to the throat tightness I often have arm pains as mentioned, and little chest pains and burns. I have attributed this the same as the arm pain as caused by bruising, since I can often find sore to the touch spots on my chest when I feel the pains. Again, I don't know if this is the right way to conclude this, but since my cardiologist doesn't believe it is cardiac and the 6 times I've been to the hospital have been inconclusive, I don't know what else to do. Now the throat tightness, I can't find some kind of reasoning for that. Even the ENTs don't have an answer. So essentially, I go through every single day wondering If i am having another heart attack, EVERY SINGLE DAY.

How many times am I going to spend a weekend in the hospital? I already miss a ton of days of work to go to the cardiologist, ENT, PCP, endocrinologist (I am diabetic), I am also currently having scans done for odd lumps on my breast area (just what I need right now). It's difficult to even focus on anything when I am at work because I always feel as though I should be in the hospital, since I have these symptoms EVERY DAY. I can't hold a conversation with anyone, because I am always thinking about these symptoms. My life has just been suffering. I'm trying so hard to live, but I can't get an answer, I can't get some peace of mind. I can't get anything. I just don't know what to do or what to make of these issues.",AskDocs,t3_dkds2c

"Itchy ALL the time  I am itchy ALL the time, it is unbearable. I shower regularly, always use lotion so my skin isn't dry, I've tried switching detergents, cleaning like mad, I take as much Benadryl and Reactine as humanly suggested, I use itch creams like Hydrocortisone which provide some relief, but it's gone very quickly and unless they sell it by the barrel I can't justify buying a tube every 2-3 days. I've even tried changing my diet. I do bring it up at doctor visits, though he usually just says it's probably not serious and suggests creams (been there) and over the counter allergy medications(done that), so perhaps he's just not taking me seriously.

Sex: Female

Height: 5'7""

Weight: 290

Race: Caucasian

Duration of complaint: Noticed it start in 2016

Location: Canada

Existing Medical Issues:  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),  Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) 

Current medications: Tri-cyclen, low dose Accutane and Metformin(for PCOS not diabetes).

Recreationally: THC Oil.

&amp;#x200B;

In the beginning of 2016, probably february, I had been dealing with a lot of hormonal issues and went to my doctor who diagnosed me with PCOS which was fine.. Okay perhaps not fine but at least I knew what it was and what I could do for it. He put me on Tri-cyclen and Accutane (The acne from my messed up hormones was starting to leave scars.) Around June I hadn't really noticed a change and went back, did new blood work and all that jazz, and my doctor put me on Spironolactone to try to help reduce the unfortunate ladybeard with which I had been plagued. I started taking it with no noticable problems to begin with but started noticing something weird, about mid-July. I was itchier than usual and any kind of skin irritation would welt up and become unbelievably itchy, and I mean like any kind of skin irritation, even just a small LIGHT scratch on my hand would welt up. My best example of it is from that July, I was at a family gathering and I had to take my shoes and socks off because the impression of my socks against the tops of my feet had caused the entire tops of both of my feet to welt up and were extremely itchy. I took the Spironolactone for a couple months after that, but eventually stopped because I noticed I hadn't had the itching or the welts until I started it. The welts have mostly stopped, but the itchiness has persisted and is near constant. I don't know if theres a connection to the Spironolactone, I just know that the itchiness started around the time I started taking it. I also thought it could be the accutane, since I know the higher dose of accutane I was on really dries you out but I was off of accutane for a good while with no improvement. I thought perhaps HS would be the cause but the only ""itchiness"" problems I see for that are only to do with the affected area, which I do experience... On top of the other itchiness. I haven't seen a dermatologist yet, and will be making an appointment to see one soon. Mostly posting just in case anyone has seen something like this or has suggestions.",AskDocs,t3_dkf8fy
"[30F] Dupuytrens diagnosis but I’m confused over it 30 
Female 
5’5”
White
Not a drinker
Not a smoker
No drug use

I noticed a tiny lump in the palm of my left hand just under a year ago. About 3 months later I went to my primary care Dr. for something unrelated so I brought it up. He said it was either dupuytrens or a cyst and if it wasn’t causing pain it’s no big deal. I was happy with that since it’s never been painful. It can get sore if I’m doing things like tying a bunch of ribbons or typing for hours but it doesn’t really hurt. I do have a high tolerance for pain though. 

Fast forward 6 months later and my last two fingers are curved and the bump is larger. I asked my doctor about it again recently and he said it now looked like classic dupuytrens and to let him know if it starts to hurt and he can send me to a physical therapist. 

It’s not painful so I declined. I honestly don’t have the time for weekly physical therapy appointments as it is right now so I’m hoping it doesn’t become painful later on. 

I did some google image searches (bad idea lol) and now I’m confused. Everything I see on dupuytrens mostly shows straight fingers but bent towards the palm. I got this at 29 as a female, I feel like it came on fast and I feel like my last two fingers move away from my palm rather than towards it. I’m just curious if it looks like dupuytrens to anyone else or if it could be something different? To me the bump does very much resemble dupuytrens but my curved fingers are what’s throwing me off. 

Something worth noting (might be completely irrelevant) is a few months before I noticed the bump in my palm I was leash training my strong and reactive rescue dog at the time so I would often wrap the leash around my palm several times for better control when he pulled. I can’t recall ever injuring my hand though. I also had a ganglion cyst removed on my wrist of that hand 12 years ago which is probably irrelevant too. No issues, it never came back.  

Please note: In the top left photo my middle finger is bent only to show the bump in my palm better. If I move my middle finger the bump in my palm moves up and down with it almost like it’s attached to that tendon or something (no clue if it actually is). My middle finger seems normal though. It’s only the last two fingers that are curving.

This will likely be lengthy but I would be beyond grateful if someone can help me in any way. 
Tldr: I haven't eaten in a week and feel nauseous af, help! 

I am a 20 yo female, caucasian and I live in Europe. I have a history of feeling nauseous quite often, and apparently polycystic ovaries. I also have some mental issues for sure, but I have only just gotten a psychological test done and won't be seeing a psychiatrist until next month. My issues have mostly to do with anxiety, depression, and poor emotion control. I also smoke weed, but haven't done so since my troubles started last week.

Now on to the issue.

I haven't eaten a proper meal since last Tuesday. On Wednesday I woke up early for college, had some coffee, and left the house. I realized I don't feel well on my commute but since I have a history of feeling sick, and I have been slightly nauseous daily since college started, I didn't pay much attention to it. I started worrying when I literally couldn't swallow a bite of a pastry I bought that I usually quite like. I ended up leaving college early that day and going home, hoping it passes.
It didn't.

In the following days I visited my doctor, who upon reading my psych evaluation said it was in my head bc I'm stressed and to go home, relax, and eat.
The following day I also went to my gynecologist. She did a vaginal ultrasound and yet again sent me on my way, saying it's polycystic ovaries.
Now, my last period was 3rd-10th October and I had sex with my bf on the 2nd and the 10th. Of course, I'm horrified of being pregnant because I can't think of anything else that would cause me to feel this way for this long.

Other than the nausea, my hands and feet are sweaty and cold but that could just be from not eating. My breasts feel slightly larger than usual but they don't hurt at all. And I had pains in my ovaries last night that somewhat persist into today. I also have some back pain. 

Today, I've been trying to eat 1 mashed banana and 1 mashed apple mixed together for 5 hours now. I feel full after every bite, and have diarrhea after approx every 5 bites. I'm also very weak. 

I did blood tests 2 or so months ago and they came back perfectly healthy, only my red cell count was slightly elevated.
My mother thinks I should just force myself to eat, but when I try it feels like I'm already full and if I keep forcing myself I just feel more nauseous. I have been drinking ginger and chamomile tea.

I will go to a hospital soon if nothing changes, but I'd really appreciate it if someone gave me their opinion on the situation as I am freaking out.",AskDocs,t3_dki0zq
"Coffee Enemas: A Deceit or Miracle for Cancer Patients? (Lymphoma? Male, 64 Years Old, 126 lbs) My father has not been diagnosed with anything yet, but his symptoms are pointing to lymphoma. His biopsy will be performed next week. Symptoms: Enlarged lymph nodes, fatigue, shortness of breath, weakness in legs, loss of appetite, and SIGNIFICANT weight loss. He maintained a weight of 145 lbs for years, but now he is 126 lbs and it has been concerning my mom, sister, and I.  This happened in a span of a year.

He is retired and mainly lives a sedentary lifestyle and eats twice a day. Obviously, this is not okay. We try to encourage him to eat more and be more active, but he has no ambition to eat and exercise due to his symptoms.  Because of his age and disinterest to change his lifestyle, my sister and I stepping up to the plate as his main caregivers now. We cook heavy meals for him high in protein and moderate carbohydrates from veggies for him to eat 3 times a day. Everyday, we make him 32 oz of homemade organic vegetable and fruit juice with our juicer. He now does light exercise at the gym 2-3 a week.

My main focus is for him to eat healthy and get enough calories a day for him to gain weight and strength. However, my sister is more concerned with finding alternative treatments to detoxify his body and prevent the what-we-believe-to-be-cancer from worsening. She puts an emphasis on juicing, dry brushing, and coffee enemas, which comes from The Gerson Therapy, an alternative medicine approach. I personally do not believe in the Gerson Therapy. There is no evidence that proves the effectiveness of coffee enemas, but she believes in it so much and states how the medical field purposely doesn't disclose these benefits to profit from more expensive treatments such as chemotherapy, ect. In a nutshell, my sister is a hippie. I am having a hard time with her. I don't want to make any decisions that can potentially harm my father, but she thinks the Gerson Therapy is the best approach. I just find it frustrating  especially because I am 25 and she is 36 and I wish she wasn't easily swayed by what the Internet says. It's an illogical approach, but again I could be wrong.......? I want to know what you all think about coffee enemas or if you've personally had any experience with it. My dad has done them daily for a week already (while I was out of town), and when I came back and he was 4 lbs lighter, and I put a firm halt on them. I told my sister enough is enough!!!

I work as a nightlife photographer, so 3-4 nights a week I'm out in clubs taking photographs. On Wednesday night I took an elbow to the temple quite hard. I remained conscious, just felt a bit dazed for a few seconds, but carried on. It hurt a lot, but I drank water, finished my night ajd went home. 

The next day it hurt quite bad, no Biggie. Popped some ibuprofen and went about my day. Thursday night was fine, and I had no discomfort. Friday night it started to hurt again a little when out shooting, but nothing massive. 

The kicker was Saturday morning. I woke up in the early hours in an immense amount of pain on my temple. It felt like my head was going to explode. But I'm not one to bother medical staff for something that might not be serious when they have more important injuries, so I just popped some more ibuprofen and life was bliss.

Then she gave me a strongly-worded lecture on taking care of my diabetes, which I've been a bit lax on. Thanks for the advice!!)

34F. 5'10""/190lb. Diabetes 2. No STDs, smoking, drinking, or drugs. Gave birth 12mos ago.

Last week I got a ton of infections at once. UTI, Vaginal yeast infection, 5 different infected cuts on my body, infected gum around tooth, cracked and bleeding ringworm on 3 fingers, and two boils on my perineum. 

One boil went away, but one has been getting worse since it appeared 7 days ago.

It is roughly the size of a golf ball and it has a dark black bloody head that has dripped one or two drops of blood. It is so insanely painful that I literally cannot sit down I have to stand or lay down only. I can't wear underwear because anything touching it feels like my skin is on fire.

I made an appointment with a free clinic, but it doesn't have an appointment open until almost 4 weeks from now. 

I'm scared it might be MRSA instead of a regular boil, but I have no insurance and I don't want to spend $1,000 in the ER if it's something that can wait. 

In your experience, is this something I should seek urgent Care for? Or am I overreacting?",AskDocs,t3_dkgjyf
"Kidney pain when I’m about to start my period/on my period 23F So a couple of years ago when I turned 21 and started drinking, I was getting terrible UTIs.

For the past couple years now, I’ve noticed anytime I’m about to start my period, I get the same kidney pain I was feeling when I was having a UTI.

"Tried to pull out the ‘string’ hanging out of incision, instantly regretted it 22F - 175cm 75kg

Two days ago I had my implanon (contraceptive rod) taken out of my arm. It was supposed to be taken out after three years but life got in the way and I kept forgetting so it ended up being in my arm for longer. Getting it out proved difficult for the doctor, he made a small incision in the spot it was originally inserted as you could very obviously feel and see it under the skin if you pressed on it and it was still in its original spot. After making the cut he found it very difficult to find, I guess tissue or whatever had grown over it and that why it seemed to be “hiding” so it took him a while and a fair amount of tugging and manipulating my arm to get a hold on the end of the implant. After that it was over super quickly, I didn’t feel any pain during the whole thing and found the whole removal to go pretty smoothly. 

After that a nurse came and put a steri-strip over the incision, then a plaster over that and then a pressure bandage to help with bruising. The bandage was meant to stay on for 24hrs, the plaster for 3 days and the steri-strip until it fell off. The bandage was put on way too tight and felt like it was cutting circulation to my arm so I loosened it after 30-60 minutes and then eventually removed it all together, the plaster came off in the shower the next morning (yesterday) so I put a bandaid over the strip because it was stained with blood and I had to go to work. Today the bandaid and the strip both came off and there was a little white string looking thing hanging out of the incision, there were definitely no stitched used so I assumed it was a fibre or something from the plaster that had somehow managed to work it’s way into the cut? Even though it was covered by a steri strip? After a few hours it was still there so I tried pulling it out with tweezers, it seemed to be really stuck in the incision and did not want to budge even after I pulled a little harder. I have an extremely strong stomach and am never bothered with things like that but after trying to pull on the ‘string’ I suddenly got extremely hot which just kept getting worse and I felt faint and weak and nauseous almost. It started bleeding so I put a tissue over it while I sat for a bit and had some water and food thinking that dehydration or something may have been the cause of me feeling unwell. After a few minutes and feeling a little bit better I went to show someone else and get their opinion and the tissue had stuck to the string. I didn’t try and pull much, just tried to move it to the side to get a better look and as soon as it started to move the ‘string’ with it I instantly started to feel horribly ill again and had to stop.

Any idea why this is happening and if I need to see a doctor go get the ‘string’ removed or if it will come out on it’s own?",AskDocs,t3_dk34z0
"What to do about cough I get every Fall &amp; Winter? Hi Doctors. Sorry if this seems like a stupid question, but every year, I start coughing in the Fall and Winter. I'm 22F in the US and have never smoked, had asthma, or know of any other respiratory conditions besides pollen allergy in the Spring. I take Allegra-D for my pollen allergy and it does the trick. My brother had asthma as a kid but it's gone now, and my mom has a severe allergy to pollen in the Spring that she takes prescription medication for. We have no other respiratory conditions in the family though.

Anyway, I've been getting this dry cough in the Fall and Winter for years now. Medication like Nyquil don't really work well, so I usually just suffer and bring cough drops + water everywhere. I'm getting really tired of it though because I just had a cough attack for a good 5-10 minutes. It felt like I was having spasms in my throat, like I couldn't stop coughing until I drank half a water bottle and took some deep breaths. I sometimes cough every few minutes or just several times an hour, it just depends. I find that I cough more at home than when I'm out, but I think I just contain it because I don't want to be annoying in the library or at Starbucks. There's no mucus that I know of, but my throat does hurt right now after that cough attack. I can breathe fine, and as far as I can tell, I don't have any wheezing or other adventitious sounds.

"NSFW--&gt;Series of strange urogenital symptoms; doctors can't give me a diagnosis **21F, 5'5, 130 lbs, White,** **Medications**: *Loratadine, Wellbutrin 300 mg XR, Kyleena IUD, Adderal 20 mg IR as needed*

My problems started 6 months ago when I first had sex with my current boyfriend. When I went to my OBGYN she told me that she suspected Chlamydia or Gonnorhea, and that I definitely had a UTI which I was prescribed antibiotics for. My boyfriend &amp; I both got tested for STDs​ &amp; STI's but everything came back negative. He is completely asymptomatic, but I have been having recurrent UTI's (E.coli) every month or so. I started taking a dose of Bactrim after sex about a month ago &amp; have since stopped getting UTI's, but I'm still having a whole slew of other symptoms.

**These include:**

* Brown bleeding during sex; this happens every time &amp; there is no spotting afterward but it's definitely blood. It's not related to my period (which is either very light or nonexistent) &amp; none of the doctors I've seen can tell me what's causing it which is extremely frustrating.
* My periods are either very light or nonexistent, I think this is from my IUD
* A feeling of air or air bubbles being trapped in my vagina or urethra after I pee. This doesn't hurt but it's very distracting and unpleasant
* Sharp stabbing pain in vagina randomly, doesn't follow any pattern as far as I can tell
* White discharge under the ​clitoral hood that comes &amp; goes
* Decreased vaginal lubrication that's not an issue not being ""warmed up"" I just CAN'T get wet 75% of the time
* Occasionally I have sharp pain during sex, but it usually only lasts a few minutes
* A week or two ago I had two lymph nodes in my groin swell up &amp; become very tender. I haven't been sick &amp; they're starting to go away but I can still feel them
* Recently I've developed an ulcer on my vulva (pic in link). It's been there for at least a month but until recently it's just looked like a red, irritated patch.  There is a skin tag near it that may have rubbed the skin &amp; caused the spot. The tag has been present for over a year but this is the first time it's caused problems. Also in the picture, there are red spots and those are very new, I think they're from rough sex. I also have a history of mouth ulcers which could be relevant [https://imgur.com/a/TP6HzBd](https://imgur.com/a/TP6HzBd) 

**Tests &amp; Results:**

* I've had a transvaginal ultrasound &amp; a pelvic ultrasound both of which came back normal
* My last Pap smear indicated moderate cervical dysplasia, so I had a colposcopy &amp; a biopsy was taken that came back as ""rare benign squamous epithelium""
* My OBGYN didn't bother testing for HPV but implied that I probably had it (I got the Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines way before any of this but I know I can still get HPV)
* I was tested for Ureaplasma &amp; I really thought it could be this but the test came back negative
* Another OBGYN told me that he thought I had pelvic floor dysfunction (the kind where the pelvic floor is too tight) I think I do too but I don't know if it fully explains what's going on with me

I think that covers everything. I'm going to the doctor next week to see if I can get an order for bloodwork to rule out low estrogen or a vitamin deficiency.

"Help! No diagnosis. Tired of tests. Want to fully live my life. **TLDR at the end with bullet points, medical records and findings.**

22F. 135lbs. 5'7""/5'8"". Caucasian. Canadian.

Before the first bit gets you, please read the TLDR bottom medical stuff. I really need some guidance and ideas of what to look into or suggest to doctors. I've done a barium swallow, ECG, ultrasounds, an MRI, tons of blood tests, seen a rheumatologist, consistently see a nephrologist, consistently see a psychiatrist. Notes below of reports from some of these tests.

Can give blood work results if you ask for anything specific, because it's most likely been checked. Can also provide images of the bladder and things from my MRI and ultrasounds.

I just want to live life fully.

A bit of an intro: So. Both mental and physical. Since around late 2015 I was hit with a depressive episode which is where everything starts. Had depression before this, but this was a benchmark for shit *really* affecting my life. Earlier in the year experienced a hypomanic episode. First psychiatric medication Escitalopram started around 2014ish. Been on psychiatric medication since. I still haven't fully 'recovered'

Along that time everything hit. Depressive episode which was more of a lack of everything. Lack of motivation, energy, liveliness, would just lay in bed, sleep all day, socially isolated myself, fell out of touch with all my friends, blah blah.

After I stopped really feeling depressed, the other symptoms still lingered. No motivation, no energy, always exhausted to the point where my face and eyes and body would ache all over, feeling like it was skin level almost? I would be so tired I would need to take 3 hour naps every single day, sleeping a total of 12 or 13 hours every day, so definitely oversleeping.

The fatigue was a pain in the ass. It basically disabled me. Couldn't really do things, function normally, it hurt, I was fighting sleep a lot. It sucked. It wasn't 24/7, and even when I wasn't feeling pain or extreme fatigue I still had no motivation or drive to do anything. I still deal with having aversions to things, a mental block that has no thought just no no no I can't do this. Avoidance. Blah blah. It fucking sucks. I wanna go on walks. I want to be social and have a social life and go outside regularly, not inside 24/7. I want friends again. I want to want to do things. Not have this mental block overwhelming me with not wanting to do things, and having the overwhelming want of what I want to do is the act of staying inside doing bare minimum. Things that take little to no mental energy or focus or grounding.

I feel like I've been floating through life, a blur, since 2015.

Gone through a bunch of therapy and psychiatric meds. Early on I had extreme nausea issues especially after eating. Had a barium swallow, blood tests, ECG, ultrasounds, MRI, and I know I had others I just can't remember right now it all blurs together.

I also recently remembered that when I was in the 6th grade, I flipped over the handlebars of my bike, head first onto the sidewalk (protected by my helmet, thankfully) messed up my knees real bad, couldnt walk or bend my knees for quite some time. Some reason I never saw a doctor about it.

"Boils on body Hello, I'm 23 F, 5'3, 152 pounds, Indian-Canadian. I'm concerned about some boils appearing on my body, that I've noticed in the last 3 weeks. I currently take cranberry pills to prevent UTIs that I get rather frequently. I don't smoke or do any drugs, but I drink occasionally. 

The boils are appearing only one or two at a time - not all together. They resemble chicken pox, but I've already contracted this when I was younger. These boils also don't leave a scab, like they would in chicken pox.

They first appeared on my upper-inner thighs, then inside my ear, then my behind, and now my leg.

My partner was diagnosed with shingles/herpes around 7 months ago, but given that my boils are appearing all over my body, I don't think that's the case for me?

"[28M]Painful urination - a few questions (warning: graphic) So about a week and a half after getting oral sex from an escort without protection I started to experience a burning sensation when I pee. I feel it inside the urethra just below the glans and if I apply a little pressure, it feels sore. As I pee continually for a longer time though, the pain subsides. I went to a clinic and submitted a urine sample. The doctor prescribed a one-time dose of 1000 mg of azithromycin and said to call in a few days regarding the test results. The dipstick urinalysis however, came out negative for blood/bacteria. I have a couple of questions:

1. What are the chances this is genital herpes? Could it manifest as painful urination? I read that dysuria may be a symptom of genital herpes but I do not see any sores and the pain seems to be inside the urethra not close to the opening.

2. How common are UTIs in males? The doctor presumes it is an STI but I don't see any discharge although I get a little urine leakage when I pee (as in a little extra urine may come out when it seems like I'm done). Internet resources all seem to have lots of info about UTIs in women but make it seem as though they are exceedingly rare in men. If it makes any difference, the girl I had sex with used a LOT of saliva (basically slobbered all over my dick). 

3. Is it safe to drink a couple of beers about 8 hours after dosing azithromycin? The information seems to be conflicting on this. Some sources say you can drink on it and others say it will cause liver damage. NHS (UK) website says you can drink alcohol on zithromax while Health Canada just says ""avoid alcohol on antibiotics"". I'm going out for dinner with a few colleagues so I am expecting to have a couple of drinks (NO hard liquor). 

4. This might sound a little weird but my dog has been having recurring urinary tract infections for about a year now that he has repeatedly been treated with antibiotics for.

Starting to get off and on chest pains. Uncomfortable and feels like it’s a crushing pain/sharp. Breathing is a little more difficult but I can still take full breaths, but I have to focus on it more. It’s becoming more common and has been for the past 2 weeks. Last for a few hours generally but it’s been all day today. My heart rate is still normal, 68 BPM just about an hour ago. Coughing too but my throat has been starting to get ticklish so maybe that’s a separate issue

Thursday I was in class and randomly started feeling dizzy for a few minutes and heart was kind of fast. Mentally I felt disassociated/ kind of panicky. Kind of like a fear of death but I reassured myself and took deep breaths and after a few mins it went away.  Also the mental dissociation is starting to happen more often. Like 10 mins today and a few mins yesterday. 

The best way to describe the mental dissociation (what I call it because Idk of a better term) is I just don’t feel like I’m in my body. Very zoned out and feel like I’m in a 3rd view. Along with slight panic feeling. Idk if that makes sense. 


It may be because of mid terms, lack of sleep, and other financial problems the past few weeks. Hopefully it is. I stopped juuling around 5 weeks ago. 

Pretty good medical history. Had seizures as a toddler and diagnosed with ADD but other than that pretty normal.

"Please I need to know why antidepressants barely work for me whereas an OTC anticholinergic completely gets rid of my depression. I am a 31M, 1.65m, 50kg, caucasian.

I've been diagnosed with dysthymia and I've tried countless different antidepressants of all kinds. Some didn't work at all while most of them can get rid of some symptoms of my depression, but I never feel 100% ""normal"". Since this disease is chronic I'm depressed 24/7, some days more, some days less, but never good enough. I am currently on mirtazapine 30mg and escitalopram 15mg.

That was until last year when I started abusing DMH (dimenhydrinate). That's when my life changed. I am 31 years old and I felt like I was suddenly awaken, as if I was dreaming or in a deep fog and then by abusing this drug the veil or curse has been lifted from me and now I finally feel alive after over 20 long painful years living with this condition.

Of course I know it's stupid, I've read countless articles about DMH and it's slowly poisoning my brain. But it works, so much so I have now become addicted to it. I can't really function without it. So I think I'm going to keep taking it until I can find something that really works without doing any more harm.

"Sudden prominent blue veins on chest shoulders and arms I am a 28 y/o male and will try to be as detailed as I can. Last Monday I was cleaning out my room and was lifting some heavier stuff, maybe 20-30 lbs. the next morning when I got out of the shower I noticed in the mirror that the veins in my shoulders and arms, and on my armpits as well were very prominent and blue. Not like swollen but I could easily see them under my skin. This made me very nervous as I have brown skin this time of year and am not particularly light.

Besides the heavy lifting the day before I have been exercising (but mostly my core and legs not arms) about 5 times a week for the past 8 weeks, I also swim a mile about five times a week as well but lately my pool is getting cold and I’m not sure if cold water is to blame?

I’m asking here because it takes awhile to get appointments with my doctor and I suffer from severe anxiety disorders and health anxiety.

Throwaway because my main account is identifiable. 

I’m randomly swearing, clapping, hitting myself, and clenching for no reason and involuntarily. This started in my senior year of high school three years ago. At first it was small random noises which I could hide reasonably well. That’s how it stayed for 2 1/2 years. Until January of this year when it just got way out of control and to a point where I can’t stop it. I don’t swear in normal conversation thanks to a very strict upbringing but I’ve started randomly blurting the f word, clapping involuntarily, and shouting “I hate you” at the top of my lungs to nobody in particular, and slapping myself at full force. At this point I’m also clawing myself in my sleep and leaving marks and scratches in the morning. I’m not sure if this is related to the tics but the only thing that helps is when I sleep in mittens. I usually can hide the smaller tics easily, but I can’t hide this anymore and I can’t even tell when an episode is coming. I can’t tell something’s wrong till I’m actively doing something my brain did tell my limbs to do. I’ve stopped driving because I’ll randomly clap while operating a vehicle. It’s never caused an accident or anything, but I really don’t know why this is happening. There’s no pattern but it’s far worse when I get upset, embarrassed, or stressed. It’s like my whole body tenses up and all I can do are these random impulsive things without any urge, or desire to. I’m used to the anxiety that I have but even that is magnified when this happens. I know about Tourette’s syndrome, but I always thought  that presented much earlier. This literally just started getting bad at the top of this year.  Any ideas on what this could be?

Is it safe to be taking this much melatonin?
No current medications

So I’m 14 and this summer I screwed my self big time and went from no problems sleeping to going to sleep at 7am and trouble sleeping most nights. I don’t know if the insomnia is anxiety or something else but it’s been a problem ever since. I’m back to a normal sleeping schedule now but I still don’t get tired until like 1230 or 1am and with how early I need to wake up thats not ideal. So I started taking melatonin. The bottle was 5mg and I was taking it for a while, about 9 weeks or so now, and it’s started to not work very well. My dad went to the store to get more today but all they had were 10mg. I don’t have a problem with sleeping on the weekends but if I don’t take it during the week, there no way I would fall asleep when I need to and I just couldn’t be rested enough to function at school. I know I shouldn’t really be taking it in the first place but here I am and I’m kind of a big hypochondriac, so I just need to know if it’s safe to be going from 5mg to 10 or (the 10mg melatonin are gummies) should I bite off less than the whole gummy?

Ever since I was a kid if people besides myself touched my face I would feel shocks(for a lack of a better term)down my spine. It’s like this weird sort of tingling.They’re pretty unpleasant and kind of hurt, but not exactly. It’s a very unique sensation. My back would also sometimes twitch. Situations where this would happen were varied: during lice checks at school, whenever I got my face painted, the one time I got my makeup done; basically anyone anytime touched my face or head. Touching my hair will sometimes cause this weird unpleasant sort of tingling. 

I’ve never known why this is, but it’s very odd and can be a bit problematic. Could there be a medical reason for this or is it more likely to be something psychological?

"19F chest pains for a few weeks Less than a month ago, I went for a run outside. I used to run a lot and never had a problem, but in the past year school has kept me from running as much as I'd like. After my run, I felt sore and had some chest pains that I figured were due to exertion after a period of little strenuous activity. However, a mild chest pain has lingered since.

The vast majority of the time, I do not feel it, only when I take deep breathes. It feels more intense when I'm tired or when I'm lying down.

"Pain in top of foot I'm a 23F runner; I've been running roughly 3 times a week, about 10-ish miles per week so far. Mondays and Wednesdays were my shorter, faster runs; I'd go for about 2 miles at about 11:45 min/mi., and Saturdays were my longer, slower runs; I'd go around 5 miles at about 12:30 min/mi.  I stretch before and after each run. 

About a month ago I started having pain on the top of my foot, right over the 3rd metatarsal. I'm also a ""toe cracker"", and it really hurt to pull the third toe down to crack it. It also hurt to walk on it in flat shoes. I had the sports therapist at college look at it, and he couldn't seem to find out the problem, so I went to a podiatrist. He sent me to get an x-ray to see if there were any fractures, but there were none. He thinks it's just tendonitis. 

I looked up tendonitis in the metatarsals, and the most common seems to be extender tendonitis. But I noticed that typically people with that condition have pain when stretching their toes up, not down. My toe does not hurt to stretch it upwards or even to walk in heels. I also can't seem to find anything about pain when bending/pulling toes down in a Google search other than for the big toe. 

My foot has seemed to be healing. However, when I pull the third toe downward as if to crack it, I still feel pain in the metatarsal region. When I put pressure on that region, it does hurt, but nowhere else. I took 3 weeks off of running since it hurt so much, but I've been slowly getting back into running about once a week. So far, so good, but I don't want to overdo it. Other runner friends of mine have recommended icing my foot several times a day and using compression. I've been following their suggestions.

Bloodwork from his annual physical was great...except maybe his TSH was on the low end at .61 mIU/L

My boyfriend and I have been together 3y.  A year ago, I noticed he had a lump 3-4 inches wide on the left side occipital bone. He wasn’t aware of it and denied any injury to the area.  It’s not super firm, no pitting, blanching, itching, heat, or tenderness. A quick glance and feel suggests lipoma to me (I’m not a doctor, I’ve owned a large horse boarding/training facility for 12 years. Mysterious bumps, fungal/bacterial/parasitic infections, various wounds and lamenesses etc. is an everyday thing for me). However, the rash over the lump seems odd. 

He was experiencing some cold/allergy like symptoms at the time we discovered the lump, so he went to the dr without much fuss.  The doc thought the lump was interesting but not too concerned and he was given antibiotics. I took pictures of the lump the day I found it, and a month later and it didn’t seem to be changing, so we let it be.

A few weeks ago, I happened to notice it’s changed and the rash is still there. I want him to go get it checked out but he doesn’t have great insurance.  Any likely possibilities?

**With that out of the way, let me explain my history with this:**

So, this all started in the beginning of this year, after I had been at a gig with my band, and I ended up catching a severe cold that put me out of commission for over a week. There was a period where I could barely talk. During this time, I started having issues with my right ear. It felt as if something was clogging up the ear canal. I go to my local health clinic and they say that I have a lot of earwax in my ear. They flush it, and I leave, feeling a bit better, but the next day, I notice the feeling is still there.

Over the course of 2 months, I come back a couple of more times to get my ears cleaned, as well as to verify that it's not an ear infection, which according to the nurses I went to, it wasn't. In May, I got a recommendation from the nurse to try using an anti-inflammatory nose spray named [Nasonex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mometasone), or Mometasone, according to Wikipedia. I used it for about a month's time, and without any results, I stopped. In July, I went back to the clinic, where I got to do a hearing test, as I noticed my hearing had gotten worse, but according to the test, I got very high results, which surprised me. I'll get to this in the part where I talk about my symptoms.

Anyway, this is where I get a referral to the ENT-clinic to meet with a specialist, rather than just the district nurse. Wait times are usually pretty long, so I got an appointment about 2 and a half months later, on October 13th, a week ago now.

I get to this appointment, and they run another hearing test, which is a bit more advanced than the previous one, due to them having isolated rooms and the ability to measure much quieter sounds. Again, to my surprise, this test comes out with good results.

I then meet with the specialist doctor, and this is when I'm unsure. I don't know about this doctor, but I don't know anything, so I obviously can't tell if his conduct was good or not. I may get a second opinion, maybe even from a different hospital? I don't know if that's recommended, though..

Either way, I tell him about my symptoms (listed below), he feels on my throat, temples, and has me open and close my mouth.. You know, typical examination stuff. He also puts a camera into my nose, sprays some type of liquid into it, and also takes a look down my throat. In the end he says that he can't find anything wrong with me. He seemed to be convinced that I'm making things up, or that it's all in my imagination. He said to go home, stop thinking about it (which is hard since I notice it at all times), and come back if it gets worse, which seems ridiculous to me, because if it gets worse, it may be too late.

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**A TL;DR for the history bit**

January - Started feeling clogged in right ear, went to district nurse. Went back a few more times. It's not an ear infection.

May - Got recommendation for Nasonex, an anti-inflammatory nose spray. Used for a month, didn't work.

July - Situation worsened, went back to district nurse, did hear test, good score. Got referral to specialist.

October - Situation worsened again, a day before I went to specialist. Did more advanced hear test, they said nothing's wrong. In my experience, this isn't accurate.

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**See, I'm scared to death of the possibility of becoming deaf**, or ending up with some kind of irreparable hearing damage. I'm worried that's what I already have. I'm a musician, and so music is extremely important to me, but for the past few months, and especially the last week when I noticed another decline, music that I've listened to a lot before doesn't sound the same anymore, so I can't really enjoy it like I used to. I know for a fact that something's different, which makes me worried for several reasons when my doctor says that there isn't anything wrong.

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

Anyway, before I babble on too much, **here is a list of the symptoms I'm having**:

* Lowered hearing. After the most recent decline, about a week ago, I can't make out what people are talking about in the room next to me. I can barely hear if somebody is shouting for me. Music doesn't sound like it used to, whether I listen to it with headphones, or live. Certain instruments are getting drowned out by the others. It's hard to make out what people in the front seat of a car is saying if I'm sitting in the back, stuff like that. I've noticed a bigger difference in dynamics than before. If someone looks away, it's suddenly way harder to hear what they're saying. I don't remember that being an issue before, nor any of the other examples I just gave.
* In general, it seems my distance-hearing is a good bit worse than it used to be.
* I sometimes feel a twinge (or sting, not sure which would be more accurate here) in both ears, as well as itching, accompanied with occasional tinnitus that lasts anywhere from 10 seconds to a few minutes, and varies from a really high-pitched sharp tone, to more of a lower-pitched ringing.
* I also sometimes have sharp pains in my temples.
* I sometimes feel a sense of popping in my ear, usually when yawning. It's sort of similar to the feeling you get when you have water in your ear, but just for a split second. Don't know if that's relevant at all, but..
* When I do things such as yawning or swallowing, there's a crackling sound in both ears. The doctor said this is just due to muscles contracting or something like that, which seems reasonable.
* I often feel stiff around my neck and jaw, and muscle stiffness and soreness in general is pretty common. I'm not very physically active so that might explain that, but that doesn't explain the neck and jaw stiffness.
* In my experience, I have very dry ears. There's dry skin peeling off of them (or maybe dry earwax, hard to tell). My doctor said that my ear canal isn't dry, but the ear..shell (I don't know what it's called in English, but outside the actual hole) is dry. He offered no further explanation, and I didn't ask, since it seemed to him like it wasn't a big deal.
* I have very thick and slimy phlegm. Sometimes, it gets stuck in my throat, and it's really difficult to get out, making me gag on it, which is very uncomfortable. The doctor said this is normal, and I found that weird since it hasn't been a problem before. Thoughts on this?
* I've had a near constant cold for 8+ months now.
* When I wear headphones that aren't the type that reach over and around, cupping your ear, my ears hurt. I work at a call center, and it's getting to the point where I can't wear the headsets we use because it hurts after a while, and it gives me anxiety.
* My voice has gotten pretty weak. I can still talk, but my throat is very rough sometimes, more so than usual.
* It might be worth noting that I woke up this morning, and my right ear felt a lot clearer than before. It felt alright. I was so happy about it, but about 5 minutes later, it went back to how it normally is.

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

That's all I have to say. I'm really sorry that this post ended up being so long, but I didn't want to omit anything, and this is stuff that has been ongoing for a year, so there was a lot to say. It's getting to the point where this is affecting my mental health as well, with anxiety and whatnot, so I'll honestly take any advice I can get. Obviously, they sent me home from the ENT-clinic without really doing much, and if I want to go back, that's another 3 months of waiting. I have no idea how to proceed from here. If anyone can answer my questions, maybe put my mind at ease on some of these things, or give me any advice in general, I really, really would appreciate it.

Height: 5ft  
Weight: 50kgs  
Race: White  
Duration: A year or so  
Current medication: Omeprazole  
Alcohol/Smoke: No  


Primary complaint:  
An extremely uncomfortable and very dry mouth. My tongue and pallet is tingly nearly all of the time from the dryness. Teeth are very sensitive because I'm always having to swallow. The dryness is affecting my teeth hygiene. 

Just recently I've been getting a build up of saliva at the front of my mouth which is making me have to swallow even more.

My ENT specialist has suggested Sjogren's Syndrome or Globus Syndrome and has prescribed Omeprazole and I am using over the counter Chemist products for dry mouth. I'm chewing gum a lot which helps but only when chewing. Once I throw the chewy away the symptoms return nearly straight away.

My local GP and ENT have pinned it on stress which wouldn't be surprising considering my Husband has a brain tumor and our family has been living in a non-stop stress environment for about 3 years now because of it.

"Is this malpractice? 26 female/12 weeks pregnant/5’6”/130lbs
Severe tooth pain 
I woke up with my entire jaw swollen and throbbing so I went to the ER. It’s been hurting for a month but we just don’t have the couple thousand the dentist needs so I haven’t got it fixed. Yesterday it got unbearable to the point I woke up in the middle of the night and ended up taking ibuprofen despite knowing I can’t while pregnant. Once I could think straight, I started googling what medicines are safe and found Clindamycin and hydrocodone are safe and I think we actually have both from my husbands dental implant surgery last year. Look up doses, etc., take some and by no means does it take all the pain away but it’s bearable. Mid-morning I start having cramps! Not insane cramps but painful enough that I started to worry it’s from the ibuprofen and we head to the ER. 

Tell the ER doctor everything, he has an ultra sound done, baby is ok, looks at my tooth, draws blood and we wait for them to test. He comes back saying I have a bad infection and need to see a dentist ASAP. We can’t really afford it so he does kindly refer me to a low cost clinic but stresses I must be persistent because they’re usually booked weeks to months out and my infection is no joke. Prescribes Clindamycin, 4-150 mg pills, 3 times a day for 7 days. I ask what to do for pain and he says just try to control it with what I have and ask the dentist when I get in.
I go to pick up my prescription and happen to know the pharmacist pretty well, she asks about the infection and is super surprised he didn’t write for pain medication. When I explained more of what happened and how I took ibuprofen she was even more angry and expressed several areas of concern. The amount of antibiotic indicates the infection is very severe, ibuprofen is a HUGE no no right now, he didn’t advise me to continue taking someone else’s antibiotic but rightfully wrote me my own prescription for the same medicine, he didn’t discuss pain control and in a round about way, suggested continuing to take someone else’s pain medication or perhaps ibuprofen was ok to take...ultimately this should have been addressed head on whether he wrote a prescription for my own opioid based medicine or any other pain medicine or advised using  over the counter medicines.

"Codeine allergy or side effect? 19 y/o white female, 5'3"", 80 kg, UK

I recently had a breast reduction, and was prescribed codeine for pain after the surgery. I had surgery from 2-6pm, took 6 tablets over the course of the next day (as advised) and felt a bit groggy but overall alright. The morning after that I took another 2 tablets and began to feel very nauseous. Moving my head, blinking or closing my eyes at all made me feel really sick and I spent all morning staring at a blank wall trying to keep still. I didn't eat or drink a lot because I felt so ill.

Around lunchtime I suddenly felt ready to vomit, and when I retched to vomit I had a seizure for a couple of seconds. Arms shooting out in a T pose and going rigid, head and eyes rolling back and groaning while I vomited. I felt back to normal after coming to, not ill at all. Called an ambulance and paramedics arrived in 15 minutes. Had low BP but otherwise no issues.

In the back of the ambulance I began to feel ill again and had a seizure while vomiting again, this time throwing up a much larger volume of liquid. Again felt better for it, but again started to feel worse after a little time. Lying down seemed to be worse than sitting up.

Stayed in hospital for the afternoon, given anti-nausea tablets and eventually felt okay again. Was told not to take any more codeine, and prescribed more anti-nausea meds in case. We asked for other painkillers as I was very recently out of surgery, but was told that any other painkillers would likely give the same reaction but worse.

Was this an allergy or a side effect? I know nausea is a common side effect of codeine but the doctors implied that it was an allergy and I'm not sure whether after this I'm just not supposed to take codeine in future.",AskDocs,t3_dkbf8a

"Weird Headaches After Vestibular Neuritis Hello,

I am a 24 year old female on no meds who was diagnosed with a case of vestibular neuritis, beginning August 17th. I woke up that day extremely dizzy and nauseous, vomited twice, and had some diarrhea. The dizziness (spinning, like vertigo), lasted another two days, though no more vomiting. It started to get a bit better, and then the dizziness rapidly shifted feeling - from spinning to rocking, as if I was on a boat. I was taking Gravol to control the ensuing nausea (as I am already quite prone to motion sickness). Initially I was unable to read or look at a computer, but I was able to lie down and watch mindless TV. These symptoms gradually abated after about 7 weeks. 

During this time I went to see two ENTs and a neurologist, and had an MRI (on August 27th, found to be normal). After describing my symptoms, I was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis rather than vestibular migraines (that was a concern, as I am generally prone to migraines, though never before have I experienced something of this nature), since I was not experiencing headaches during this time.

At my last appointment with my ENT on September 20th, the doctor had me lie down with my head hanging over the edge of the table to test how I felt. I immediately felt nauseous, and when I went home I wasn’t feeling well and I went to sleep. I woke up and felt quite intense pressure in my neck and at the top left side of my head.

Since this time I have had these odd pressure-pain headaches almost every day. They travel around, generally beginning at the base of my skull, to follow along to either the top left or right of my head, and often concentrate near my temples (above my ear). At first I thought they might be tension headaches, but I also feel tenderness around the areas where the pain is, and it’s been weeks that I’ve had these symptoms now. Neither regular Advil, Tylenol, nor Voltaren/Naproxen alleviate the pain, and I’m starting to worry that there’s something wrong.

I have also had some jaw pain on-and-off since August, and although this might be potentially unrelated, I have had symptoms of costichondritis as well as soreness around the joints in my arms and my lower legs since early September.

I am getting quite anxious, and I do not know what to do - I know what normal headaches and migraines feel like, and these aren’t them. Does anyone have any ideas? Should I consider getting another MRI, considering the headache symptoms started about a month after the initial dizziness (and thus after my first - and only - MRI)?

It feels like some ligaments in the knee get stuck over each other, my mom and I call it having our knee locked. It hurts like hell, and you can't straighten your leg when it happens. Someone has to physically pull on your leg, and then it pops right out and the pain is also gone instantly but your leg feels a bit weak some time after.

There have been situations where I got this while being alone, which was pretty bad because you have to pull out your own leg while it hurts, which isn't easy to do. Lately I haven't been getting it, but as a kid I used to have them pretty regular. When in the schoolyard kids always had to run to get my brother, who would then pull my leg out so the pain would be gone.

What she sent me:
""It started as what looks like acne on my stomach and went up my torso. It looked like an allergic reaction. Then it went to my back. It turned to the discoid patches and then exploded out down my legs and my arms. It’s starting to go up my neck. I’ve stopped using any perfumes products. I use free and clear detergent with barely any soap and double rinse. No drier sheets. Cetaphil and lukewarm water for showers. There was no sickness that triggered the rash, and no “herald patch” that the dermatologist insists is pityriasis rosea. I only work four hours a day because I can’t wear clothes. All the time it’s like a sunburn. After a shower it gets really really painful. If I’m wearing clothes it feels like steel wool. When it begins to heal at one end of the rash it begins to spread outwards from the other or just shows up somewhere else.""

"Addiction, 18M. Hello! I am a white hispanic male of 18 years of age, and have been smoking since I was seventeen. I smoke weed, but often we end up using the wrap of a cigarello in order to wrap up the weed in- which worries me. On top of this for a while I used pens, which is weed condensed down into oil, which I then stopped because of not knowing what was even in them. 

Near my gums, I have skin that seems to be “pulling back”. I can link a picture. I have also had a lymph node that has been swollen since the start of august- bear in mind though I was hospitalized for an adverse reaction to a meningitis shot (very small chance) and the doctor said that my lymph node could be swollen for a while. 

I have NOT told my doctor I smoke weed for fear of insurance purposes. What should I do???? I also want to quit- I am well aware I have a full blown addiction at this point, and really would like to stop- I feel as if i’m slowing dying.

EDIT: A few more additional notes. I visited an ENT for throat problems about a month ago. Frequent sore throat, mucus production up a ton, cough, he found nothing during a scope. I also had an oral cancer screen around august as well, which turned up negative. I don’t know if I should stop worrying or not though- the lymph node has me stressed. As for the frequency of how much I smoke, I started only a few times a month, until it ramped up to what it has been since about December 4-5 times a week.

"Slightly problematic blood tests but nobody seems to know why. Hoping someone can offer insight please! Hi! 35 Female here. 127 lbs, 5’6. Regularly jog 3-6 miles and do yoga. Eat pretty healthily. Don’t drink much. Having some weird blood tests. Sorry for the long post but it’s a lot of weird, maybe related, issues. 

Basically, this summer, I had a CBC cause I had some swollen lymph nodes and pain in my side. Doctor did a CBC, mono test, and neck/abdominal CT. CT was normal other than mentioning some swollen lymphatic tissue in the oral pharynx but nobody batted an eye at that. Mono negative. But the blood test revealed low hemoglobin (12.9)and MCHC (31%) (RBC count itself was ok) that indicated mild anemia. 

I started taking iron pills and returned two weeks later for another CBC. The anemia numbers had popped back up to just over the edge of normal (hemoglobin 13.1, MCHC 32%). This time though, he did the CBC with differential and it revealed a low percentage of neutrophils (39%), a high percentage of lymphocytes (50%), and the number of granulocytes was 1.65 (low). 

So, my doctor thought those were fine even though they were off, and agreed to do the blood test again in 3 months. 

Now, in the 2.5 months since then, I’ve continued to take iron, but I also got this random never ending period. Got in contact with my OB doctor over this. He did a progesterone test and it was low. An ultrasound too that cane back normal. I took 10 days of some progesterone pill, it stopped the bleeding, had a normal period but got another one two weeks later and just went to see the OB in person this past week. He did a CBC of his own, a thyroid test, and a test of the endometrial lining. My thyroid function was normal. Haven’t heard on the lining yet. 

But, the CBC. 13.9 hemoglobin, 34.2 MCHC. So yay, no anemia. But my percentage of neutrophils is still low 32.7%, and my lymphocyte percentage is still high, 55.9%. Yet, the actual numbers of lymphocytes and neutrophils are in the normal range, if barely. 1504 neutrophils, 2571 lymphocytes. My OB called and described my white counts as normal though. 

Some other things to consider.... I didn’t mention it yet, but on every single blood test I’ve taken since 2015, my MPV has been high, even when everything else is normal. Anywhere from 13-14. I don’t know if that means anything or is related to any of the other numbers. 

And, since August, I’ve had off and on sore throats with no other cold symptoms. I pop acid reflux medicine and allergy medication but it doesn’t help. The last couple weeks, my voice sounds kind of hoarse to me. Lower, like I’m tired. My OB suggested I go to an ENT for that since my thyroid test was normal. 

I should also mention that when I was pregnant in 2017 I had a super low platelet count, but that came up again after pregnancy and remains in the 200ish range. None of the white counts were off like this back then. 

So with this whole picture here, can anyone shed some light on this? I’d be very much appreciative. My mom works in another state as an oncology nurse, and she showed these numbers to the doctor she works under and she advised that I see a hematologist, but any doctor I have doesn’t seem concerned (my OB and primary care) and I don’t want to sound like a lunatic demanding to see a hematologist cause obviously I’d need referred.

"Chest Pain Traveling To Whole Body. Hello, I'm a 26 female. To kinda shorten this a bit, I'm gonna just give you a brief description of everything the may be relevant to what's going on.

22 years old - started noticing a fast heart rate while resting, along with a possible irregular heart rate. Seemed worse when I got out of the shower

24 years old - Extremely bad chest pains. Go to the ER, and was diagnosed with Costochondritis. Went away after 3 weeks.

3 months ago - started noticing chest pain, but not like Costochondritis. Sometimes sharp, sometimes burning, but would only last a minute or so. Happened randomly through out the day but seemed worse in the evening.

2 months ago - Chest Pains got worse and more frequent. Thought it could have something to do with possible irregular heart beat so I went to the ER. They did an ECG, and blood tests (Chem 8, Diner Quantitative, Hemogram, Thyroid Panel, Troponin). Nothing unusual except I was a little low in iron. They were certain the chest pains were not caused by my heart. I left the ER diagnosed with Sinus Tachycardia and Mild Microcytic Anemia.

Few Days After ER Visit - Noticed a pain in my neck that was not unlike my chest pain. Sharp, didn't last more than a minute, and random. I had started taking iron supplements the same day I left the ER, and knew that Iron Supplements can cause acid reflux, so I told myself it was probably that.

3 days ago - Still getting chest pain as well as throat pain, although seemingly much more infrequent. Had felt a lot better after the ER visit since I knew it had nothing to do with my heart, and had kind of learned to ignore the pain. 
I was talking to my roommate, just swinging my arms back and forth when I got terrible pain in my chest. I tried to ignore it, so I took some Ibuprofen and went to bed.

Yesterday - Woke up around 6am without chest or neck pain, but noticed a tingling in my right arm. Thought I slept on it wrong and just went about my day, but it never went away. Around 1 I felt extremely tired, and so I laid down for 20 minutes but accidentally slept for 6 hours. That's never happened before. When I woke up, I had pain in my neck, my right shoulder, and my right upper arm. The muscle in my upper arm also felt weak. I still felt tingling in that arm as well. I was also starting to feel tingling and pain in my left arm. I stayed up for a couple more hours and then went to sleep and to my surprise, I slept through the whole night even with my super long nap.

Today - I wake up and feel completely fine. No pain, No tingling, nothing. Until around midday. The tingling is better. In fact, hardly noticeable. I am however, feeling pain in what feels like the muscles all over my body. I'm also getting muscle spasms all over,  especially my stomach. The pain isn't bad, it just feels like I worked out and all of my muscles are sore.

I'm so confused as to what this is. A pinched nerve? Magnesium Defiency? I really want to avoid going to the ER if I can help it. The last two times I went were kind of pointless. Does anyone have any advice, suggestions, or suspicions as to what this is? I just feel so frustrated.",AskDocs,t3_dkcziw

"Lymphoma? Or other infection? Hi,

My mother (age 67) recently went to the hospital to have a kidney stone removed, and when she had bloodwork done before the surgery, the doctors noticed her WBC count was very high (70 - when the normal range is 4 - 10). She also has high lymphocytes and monocytes. Everything else is normal range. She has been healthy most of her life and hasn't had any major health problems. She doesn't eat the healthiest foods but is active and stays away from most sweets. The docs gave her antibiotics while in the hospital and after the kidney stone procedure (which went well) her WBC count was down to 20. She was released from the hospital and has been getting her blood checked each month since. Fast forward 3 months and she doesn't feel fatigued but says sometimes her lymph nodes swell for a day or 2 then go back down. Her WBC count has gone up again since being in the hospital and is back at 70.  She is scheduled for a lymph node biopsy but wanted to ask if there is any chance what she is experiencing is anything other than lymphoma? Why did her white blood cell count go down so much from the antibiotics while she was in the hospital? If lymphoma is causing the WBC to be high, wouldn't her WBC count stay high regardless of antibiotics in her system??

"Have had neurological reactions now to both amoxicillin and cephalexin 37/M/6'2""/210 lbs

Meds: Lorazepam, Diazepam, Paroxetine, Quetiapine, Bisoprolol

Related conditions: Benzodiazepine dependence, myoclonus, Tourette's

I am 37 and have been on daily benzodiazepines since I was 14.

I had a really bad experience with Cipro a long time ago, and I found out that fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in benzodiazepine dependence.

I then about a year ago took 2 g amoxicillin for a dental surgery (later found out I didn't really need it). Right about an hour after taking it, I felt like I was in cold turkey benzo withdrawal. Was in hell trying to make it through the rest of the appointment (kept feeling like I was falling and seeing lightning and like my brain was just ""clipping"" off over and over again). The following two weeks I had increased myoclonus, rapid heart rate, trouble sleeping and eating, nonstop sweating—basically all signs of benzo withdrawal.

My PCP sent me to a neurologist who did an EEG and found some abnormality---something about beta waves, but said it was probably related to the benzodiazepines and wasn't serious.

It took about two weeks to get back to baseline.

I recently had to take cephalexin which I thought would be OK since I actually have been on that before without incident while on benzodiazepines.

I was fine for the first part of the day and then I had what I would describe as delirium I've had before when trying to get off benzos---having the types of thoughts you would have as if you were falling asleep and wanting to sleep but not being able to. Then later racing really fast in my head. I had an unbearable ""seizury"" feeling. I don't have a good way to describe it. It's sort of like my brain felt like a flip-book. I was hoping it was one off and felt a bit better the next day, but the next day the same symptoms happened around the exact same times in relation to when I had taken the cephalexin.

I have read that these types of antibiotics compete for the same GABA-A and benzodiazepine receptor sites that benzodiazepine drugs do.

This is an overview of the neurotoxcicity of antibiotics:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175508/pdf/bcp0072-0381.pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175508/pdf/bcp0072-0381.pdf)

And this one relates specifically to cephalosporins:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12871648](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12871648)

It says that benzodiazepines are used to treat the convulsive effects of cephalosporins, and so if you have extreme tolerance to benzos, maybe I then am easily set into a benzo withdrawal by taking a cephalosporin?

My doctor said I could stop the cephalexin, and unlike with the amoxicillin, I seem to feel better much more quickly after stopping the cephalexin than I did after stopping the amoxicillin which took a couple of weeks to recover from.

I am concerned that I am effectively in a post-antibiotic age because I can't seem to tolerate antibiotics.

I may have other neurological problems beyond the benzo dependence. From a young age I would have weird shocks and jerks. From the time I was an infant, I was told that I would have a weird ""shocked"" appearance if a car passed outside the house, for example, whereas other kids wouldn't notice it. And even now if there's an air conditioner on and it suddenly turns off, the absence of the noise gives me a shock feeling temporarily.

I've also been told I may have a pituitary tumor because my total testosterone is 80 and I have low-to-normal LH and FSH and normal testicles. They haven't been able to get me still enough for an MRI of the sella to check due to the Tourette's.",AskDocs,t3_dka210

"Colic aftermath: question about CRP value 32F, 1.59m, 63kg

So last Tuesday night I had a colic. I've had them before and this one was 'comparable' to the others - but I've had more painful colics in the past. The difference with this colic was that after the pain receded, there was some leftover pain. I felt a fullness in my abdomen and putting pressure on it was quite painful (lower right), some movement and deep breaths were also painful.

So the next day when the pain still wasn't gone I called the doctors office to ask at what point I should make an appointment with them. And after asking about my symptoms they planned me in for the next morning.

On Thursday the gp and I talked about my colic, abdominal pain and related issues (lazy bowel - trouble pooping). Apparently the colics could be related to that, so she started me on Sandoz. But she also tested my blood for inflammation to rule out diverticulitis and appendicitis (the pain was still there on Thursday - but a bit less). My CRP value was elevated (70), so she ordered me to come back the next day (Friday) to check again.

When we tested on Friday morning it was 35 - so it's getting better! She told me to keep track of my symptoms and call in if they get worse. I had some small pains yesterday - but I'm pain free today.

Now to my question: I googled the CRP value because I didn't know what those values meant. And I read that less than 3 is desirable, less than 10 is acceptable and 100+ is really an issue. So in my (uneducated) mind 70 is quite high (2 days after the colic), and 35 is still high! But: after the colic I didn't feel sick - I just had some pain. I maybe was a little more tired than normal and sometimes my eyes were burning a little. So on one hand I'm a little proud of my body - apparently handling an inflammation without bothering me much. But I'm also a little worried about that: how can I know my body is doing ok if I don't have symptoms?

Now this is more a question for later because I'm fine now, but: what symptoms should I get when my body isn't winning the fight with an inflammation? And is it normal to feel quite normal with those CRP values?

(oh and by the way - Sandoz works: I pooped a normal poop, no blood, no pain. It's amazing! )",AskDocs,t3_dk9k7t
"Question about my ear constantly twitching? Age: 21, Sex: Female, Height: 5'1, Weight: 120 lbs, Race: Black,

Primary Complaint: my right ear constantly twitches in the same place. It isn't the entire ear and there are weeks where nothing happens, so *constant* might not be the right word, but it might be find for weeks, but then when it comes, it's twitching and twitching in these annoying spasms every other second, even while I'm sleeping (which I figure is the case bc those 2 days of constant twitching will include me waking to it twitching). Sometimes, it'll be one twitch per minute (longest is a minute and a half), and other times it'll twitch 2 to 3 times in succession, then pause for a bit, then back to twitching to 2 to 3 times in succession. It only started this June and, considering I was taking a summer class at my college, I thought it was a stress thing, but it hasn't gone away. I don't drink, smoke, or do recreational drugs. The most I do is drink a lot of coke or coffee (decaf tho bc caffeine either does nothing or makes me tired). Then I thought it was a case of me not getting a lot of sleep, but I had plenty of sleepless nights for the past years in college and have never had this happen (and I pretty much sleep longer this year bc I have less classes).

I don't know if this is serious or anything, but it's an annoyance for the 1-2 days every few weeks. It's such a short span of time in the grand scheme, but it drives me up the wall. I can place my hand over my ear and feel my ear just pulsing from the same location. I have no idea why it's just my right ear or why it's my ear that's twitching anyway. And I can't sleep on my right side when my ear's like this bc it just sounds like something's loudly moving (and something is!)

So, if anyone has any ideas or recommendations, I'm all ears (pun intended).

Edit: Just thought to add that I have anemia. I don't know if that'll clarify anything, tho it doesn't clarify anything on my end (I've had anemia my whole life and the twitching of my ear only started a few months ago). The most my anemia does is make my fingernails turn blueish purple, but it's cool. So the only things I've been taking are iron supplements. That's all.",AskDocs,t3_dkcbna

Height: 6ft

Weight: 175lbs

Race: White

Issue: So I've tried to find out about this issue online, but could only find one other post. I feel like I've looked everywhere, so I'm coming here for suggestions. To get right into it, whenever I get hungover from getting drunk the night before, I get pins and needles sensations in my body. I get these feelings in my chest and face mainly. They are not painful in anyway, just uncomfortable. It does not happen right away, but after a few hours after waking up in the morning. It seems to come in waves, meaning I get them all over my body, they stop for a little, then come back. This happens for most of the day after drinking. My heart also pounds and palpitates every once in a while when hungover, but I assumed that was normal for being hungover. I noticed I can actually trigger these sensations in two ways. Either moving around a lot (i.e. being in a car on a really bumpy road) or just from laughing a lot. I also want to note that if I get them really bad, I end up feeling pretty dizzy and out of it, but that could also be from me panicking since it scares me. I've tried taking a B complex, and multivitamins, and drinking a lot of electrolytes the day after, but they don't help. This only happens when I'm hungover. I've never gotten them without being really hungover. I typically drink once every week or two, and this only happens if I get pretty drunk. (I know 'pretty drunk' is vague, but to try to make it a bit more clear - this happened after I reached a .13 bac one night)

"Moderator Post: Impeachment-related questions and why they are not appropriate for this sub -aka- Heck no we're not touching that hot potato Hey all, 

We get a lot of posts relating to breaking news, and the ongoing impeachment inquiry in the United States is no exception. This is obviously a big story that deals with the law, and we know you have questions. After discussion among the mod team, we have decided that **we will not allow impeachment related posts in this sub right now**; they will be removed without further explanation.

We are doing this for several reasons. First, impeachment is a political and legislative process that takes place in the court of public opinion and behind closed doors in Congress. While it is a process based on constitutional and statutory law (indeed some parts may be litigated before the House votes or the Senate sits in trial); it will be a quasi-legal procedure where the outcome is as much determined by political considerations as the letter of the law. In short, it will never end up being tried before a court, so it is out of our wheelhouse.

In addition, it's impossible for anyone to provide answers to most questions. Impeachment is a sui generis process and there is very little law on which to base answers. Everything that is happening right now is taking place in a grey area, which our devoted readers will recognize is not unusual. What is _very unusual_ is that it is a grey area nearly devoid of statutory and case law borders. Anyone who claims to know for sure what will happen is lying - it’s all wishes, guesses, dowsing, and witchcraft at this point. The discussions in here would be speculative at best and argumentative at worst. /r/Legaladvice is not a forum for arguments about politics; there are plenty of places on Reddit and elsewhere to do that.

The mods agree there are fascinating legal issues here. There will likely be several Supreme Court and Court of Appeals cases that spring from this process like Athena from Zeus' forehead. If and when there is useful and interesting discussion to be had or information to be disseminated, we may open megathreads. For those few impeachment-related legal questions that likely have definite answers* we encourage you to post them in /r/legaladviceofftopic. Even there, however, the moderators will remove all but the most benign and germane. 

We value your contributions and input greatly. At present, however, we believe this sub has nothing to offer that isn't provided by other more politically focused forums**. Thank you for understanding this position, and we invite you to comment below with any questions, concerns, or just pics of your pets.

I already know that at least two other vital employees are planning to quit pretty soon as well because of how undervalued we all are. The owners have zero grasp of the concept of morale and how much it affects your business and the loyalty of your employees. I’ll be happy to leave this place behind me and watch it crumble shortly thereafter.

We never were physical only mentally ill, I have adhd and anxiety while she was bi polar. Anyways she talked about my suicide attempts, my anger issues, my obsessiveness I used to have. She failed to mention how she told everyone at school about my personal issues and mental health issues (suicide and my struggles with my abuse as a kid) I have since worked on so hard to move past. She also mentioned various other things that were personal that were our actions that we caused each other to do. Like she would bite me but I would flawl my elbow cuz it hurt so bad. So she said I would nudge her. Just a bunch of little things about us but only gave her side of the story about how horrible I was. When she was horrible to me. She would force sex on me, force me to say things and do things I would never want to do. So because of all this toxicity we both made a huge scene when we broke it off.

"[CA] iPhone stolen in transit, now a week later someone keeps contacting me to unlock the phone. Apple is not much help regarding this matter. tl;dr is basically title

/r/apple keeps hiding my post, so I really don't know where else to post about this. 
My apologies if this is misplaced.

Pre-ordered my phone a month ago, package came two weeks ago, but the iPhone box inside was empty. 

On the day my phone was scheduled to arrive, there was a problem with the shipment and I had to pick it up from the UPS distribution center later that night during after hours pickup. 

When they handed me the phone I noticed it was a little lighter than usual, but I figured it was Apple making their phones thin and light again so I didn't think much of it. Opened the box when I got home, the outer shipping box looked fine, but the phone box inside had no plastic shrink wrap, and the phone was missing. Everything else was there.

Now two weeks later someone with an area code a few cities over calls me asking me to unlock the phone and that they're out $900 and basically trying to guilt trip me into unlocking the phone.

The first person (a female with Asian accent) calls me says they purchased the phone for $900 and that they used their hard earned money to buy the phone and now it doesn't work, and asks me to unlock it. I explain that the phone has been reported stolen and to get their money back from whoever they bought it from.

Second person (same number, this time a male with a similar accent) calls about half hour later. They say they have the person selling the phone next to them and I firmly but politely told them that the phone is stolen and to get their money back from the seller, and they keep reiterating that the seller is next to them. At that point I told them this is likely the person that took my phone and hung up.

I'm very suspicious about the whole thing because if a phone is carrier locked, I don't think my phone number would appear in any way on the screen.

I'm not sure what to do and I'm a little concerned about what data they may have on me since **they somehow have my phone number.**

I've already reported the phone stolen to the carrier and to Apple, I've blocked this phone number but I keep getting calls from different numbers every time I do.

My friends say I should just continue to block the numbers but I don't want to have to keep doing this.

I'm getting ready to file a police report but even I feel like I might be going overboard. 

What should I do?

EDIT: I'm actually a little more concerned now because someone pointed out that there should have been documents inside the box, a packing list or something. Worried because this document may have my phone number, Apple ID and address.

EDIT 2: The wife of my coworker had their phone missing in the same way. Makes me think this may potentially happen again.",legaladvice,t3_dl5y2r

"[CA] Discriminated at the dentist for being HIV positive. On Aug 31 I enrolled at a new dentist office for a clean up. I mentioned before enrolling that I was HIV positive and undetectable. Mentioned it also on the paperwork. After a long long long 5 hour wait near the end I was promised to get an emergency procedure done because my teeth condition was ""bad"". I believe they used fear plus me being vulnerable to agree me to sign a loan for financing over $2,000. I put my health 1st and agreed, the dentist promised to start once the loan was approved which it did. Afterwards once they start poking at my gums I bleed a bit and the dentist which happens to be the main manager looks disgusted and distributed. Stops the procedure and says they will continue the dental work once they get proof of my undetectable status from my specialist doctor. I think that's a violation of the American with disabilities act because they denied me service. I canceled the loan ASAP a few days later and was promised to get a response by september 18th, I called to check again via the loan agency to get an update and due to a technical error the dental group didn't cancel my loan and now im receiving calls and letters saying I owe money.

"Roommate stole $3700 in music gear, need advice. I live in North Carolina and was recently booked for a DJ gig and I went home to grab my gear when I noticed my $2500 DJ mixer was missing. My roommates said they had no idea what happened to it, so I filed a police report with the serial number incase it turned up at any pawnshops. A few days later the police called me and said it had been sold to the pawnshop a few months back (I work a full-time job and DJ just for fun here and there at this point in my life, so until I needed the gear, I didn’t notice it missing). The police gave me the name of the person who pawned my mixer and it turned out to be my roommate that I’ve known for 6 years and lived with for 2 years. 

I was in disbelief that it was one of my roommates would do this, so I went to the pawnshop to talk to the owner. He positively ID’d my roommate and said he’s been doing buisness there for 3-4 years. He knew a lot about him including facts about his band and where he works. While at the pawnshop I saw my guitar and a projector I owned for sale there as well. Apparently he sold my guitar amp too, but it was no longer at the pawnshop. In total he took almost $4000 worth of gear and sold it all to one pawnshop.

I asked my roommate why the police and pawnshop are telling me that he sold my stuff, and he said “no idea.” He then offered to pay whatever amount I named to not deal with the police. I told him I would send him a list of items and their values and that was the end of the conversation. 

When I went to send my roommate the text with the items missing and their value, I noticed my text didn’t go through. I tried calling him and either he ditched his phone or blocked me. I have not been able to get in any form of contact with him. I just found out through mutual friend that he is apparently planning on moving out to the west coast (we are on the east coast) sometime this month. 

I only extended him this chance because I have known him for so long and considered him a good friend. With little time left, him hiding and no form of communication I finally told the police I was ready to pursue this. The police presented my case to the magistrate and he deemed it a civil matter and not criminal... I can’t for the life of me understand how this happened because he had just got off probation for a felony charge (he allegedly stole money from a safe at his job). He might have even still been on probation during the time some of my stuff was sold (he hasn’t been off probation for that long). 

I was told the DA would contact me this Friday by the police, but word from my friends is that he is trying to leave by then. There is no doubt he will be gone before anything happens in civil court, I don’t even know what’s happening right now as no one at the DAs office will take my calls.

I expressed my concerns to the police and they told me to call the DA. I called and was told that “they only deal with criminal processes and not civil matters.” I have called a few civil lawyers around town and no one will take this case because they think it’s clearly criminal and that’s not their field. The few lawyers I talked too said it’s highly odd for the magistrate to deem this a civil matter and that I should talk to the DA.....

I am just being sent in circles here, there is concrete proof he stole this gear from me and the police even seemed surprised by the magistrates decision.

I did find out that my roommate has admitted that he sold my stuff to a few of my friends last night. He said that I hadn’t paid rent in 7 months and that I sent him texts telling to sell my gear for rent. That never happened and I always paid my rent on time, and even helped him out when he didn’t have a job. I have a steady income and have my bank statements to prove I always paid my rent. I also never would have texted him anything like that. My friends asked to look at the texts and he said they were on his other phone that he left at the house (how convenient). 

I’m not sure if that is playing a role in this and that’s why it’s being sent to civil court? If so, this guy is super crafty and I’m dealing with some sort of sociopath here. I’m an open book, I have nothing to hide and would welcome the police to investigate his claims (if he’s even made that claim to anyone other my friends).

Any advice on what I should do? He is about to leave town and I really don’t understand why this is being forced down the civil path. I’m at a point where no one is talking to me from the courts side so I’m kinda in the dark about when things would even happen for the civil process. I’ve told the police that he is leaving town from the get go. It seems like they are in no hurry or don’t care about letting a convicted felon leave the state after he has just been caught by the police for stealing WELL over the felony larceny charge limit.

I’d really appreciate any words of advice, or any thoughts! I will be forever grateful :).",legaladvice,t3_dl6fcd
"Neighbor took a bat to my car, but there was a witness. So I live in a semi-crowded neighborhood in the Tacoma Washington area with commonly scarce parking. 

A few nights back someone had parked in front of my house, so I had to grab a random parking spot in front of someone else’s place (neighbor that I’ve never met who lives a few doors down). 

Didn’t think anything about it, but apparently he got home saw my car there, and stayed up until about 2 am and was going to people’s doors around my neighborhood asking if they knew who’s car it was, and he was “waiting” for me to show up so he could confront me. 

Anyways, I didn’t know any of that info, and I just woke up and went to work the next day. That night someone else had taken my spot again, so I parked in front of a different neighbor’s house that night. The next morning I woke up and I saw that my car had the passenger-side rear view mirror bashed off and a white-paint stained dent on the top of my trunk. 

Neighbor said that they saw the guy who’s place I parked in front of two nights ago walking down the sidewalk when he noticed my car parked in front of someone else’s house and went and got a white baseball bad and smashed my vehicle. 

I called the cops, and they just sort of gave me the ho-hum, “you’ll have to solve this yourself” sort of answer. 

Anyways, my neighbors were pissed that he did that to my car, so they parked in front of the aggressive neighbors house as revenge or something and he came over and told them that if they ever parked in front of his house again, he’d “break up all of their windows” (maybe subtly admitting they’d already seen what he was willing to do). 

After all of that I guess there was some verbal altercation and a gun was flashed, the cops showed up and arrested him, and I think he’s in jail now. I was at work while this happened so I found all of this out secondhand when I returned from work last night. 

My car was only from 2016 and in great shape, and I don’t want to pay for this lunatic’s weird territorial pissing problem. The cops so far seem to be completely uninterested in doing anything for me. 

So I’m just curious, what are my options here? I want money to fix this, and he seems unhinged so I don’t want him anywhere near me or my family. I’ve never even met or seen the guy.

"IRS claims my wife owes taxes on a Student Loan that she knows nothing about 2 years ago, the IRS contacted my wife, claiming that a student loan she's not aware of was taken out in her name in 2003.  The company ultimately went out of business.  Because she ""received"" the loan, and didn't have to pay it back, the IRS now claims she now owes taxes on it, since it is now something like a gift.  We've asked the IRS to provide us with its evidence to support the claim.  She was told the company name, and she was given a phone number.  The company no longer exists, and the phone number has been disconnected.  We just received a levy notice by certified letter on Saturday.  

We have reason to believe that my wife's step father may have sought the loan without her knowledge, and kept the money himself.  He's been involved with similar schemes.  Of course, we have little proof that this occurred, because other than the name of the defunct company, we know very little about the loan.  

What recourse do we have here?  It seems that the IRS would have some responsibility to show the paper trail for the loan, but as far as we can tell, all that's known is that some company wrote off the debt at some point.  We've appealed, but that process seems to have run its course, with the result that we owe money plus interest, without any new information as to why.

"[TX] My apartment complex was bought out last month. My heater's been broken for two weeks, wifi keeps going out, bug infestations - and the new landlord(s) are ignoring all of our messages. In Austin, TX if that matters.

In mid-September, my (formerly) small, family-owned apartment complex was bought out by some massive real estate corporation. According to my former landlords, they were forced to sell it off due to the death of a family member, which caused money problems. I know little to nothing about our new landlords (NL for short). Rumor has it they are waiting until June, when all of our leases will be up,  then they're going to bulldoze the place and build a high-rise complex. 

So since then, roughly six weeks ago, everything has gone to shit:

* The entire complex's wifi completely shuts off *at least* three times every week. Usually it is out for 4-6 hours before it gets fixed. Before the NL came, this never happened even once, so we suspect that they've down-graded our wifi service. 
* My apartment has a bug infestation. Spiders, crickets, roaches, flies, moths, etc. Old Landlords payed for pest services every month - once again we suspect NL has ended or downgraded services with the pest control company.
* Recycling bins are always full to the brim, even on the day after it's supposed to get picked up, which means it probably isn't getting picked up. 
* My heater's been broken since October 15. It's Texas, so heat isn't necessary until late-November or so, but we've had a few chilly days where it would have been nice to have, you know, a warm apartment. This one I've been hassling them about for two weeks.

I've tried to contact the NL about every single one of these issues, to no avail.

Ever since the apartment was bought out, *no one* has seen hide nor hair of NL. There is an on-site office that our former landlords used to be in from 9-5 Monday thru Friday. NL promised that they would also be there during the work week, but the office is always empty. 

It's basically impossible to get in contact with them electronically, too. They have not answered several of mine or my neighbor's emails. We have submitted multiple online maintenance requests, which are completely ignored.  The phone number they gave us is the *on site office number*, and since no one is ever there, it's basically useless! The only way we can contact them is by calling the emergency maintenance line, but even that just directs us to the maintenance company, who say they'll call our landlords and then give us a call back (surprise: we never get a call back).

What should I do here? I have a host of easily fixable problems but NL are unresponsive to every method of contact. Is there any legal requirement for how often, and by what means, a landlord must be available to their tenants? If they keep ignoring us, what's my next step?

"My father passed away - his money is tearing the family apart (Ireland) My father passed away just over 6 months ago and there is some legal discrepancies on the money he left behind. His job had a death benefit and my father was vague on the details but he said ""I would be looked after"". 

He had 5 children, from two different relationships, and the second oldest 'John' is now in control of the assets as he said he was 'executor' and that I was entitled to €10'000. I tried to have a conversation with John about the Will but he wouldn't give me any proof of the assets nor the Will, claimed all the money was left to him and went on a tirade saying he didn't need to give me anything as all the money was left to him. That him giving me any money at all was out of the goodness of his heart. Absolutely lost in this situation, not sure if my dad left any kind of Will and if so, how would I obtain it. 

I am also not sure if he signed John as his executor or it just happened that way because he took care of my father while he was ill with an incurable disease. 

John is also claiming that because our father lived with him, he is entitled to €30'000 out of the supposed €80'000 (we believe it is a higher sum, due to my mother having access to my fathers accounts) that he spent on our father whilst he was in his house for 7 months. My mother, who was in a relationship with my father on and off for 26 years, has got involved in the money situation, has rang John and escalated the situation with him. John has threatened to take my mother to court over defamation.

"Restaurant owners took 24% of my tip last night. UPDATE: I’m actually working a shift at this place right now. My plan was to talk with the owners in person after the shift, however a handful of you have suggested emailing/texting would be better since there’s no guarantee they’d consent to being recorded. My plan now is to email them either after my shift tonight or some time tomorrow after I’ve made some necessary calls. I understand now that it may be legal after all given that it was an included service charge.

I live in Maryland. I wait tables for $3.63 an hour plus tips. Last night I was handed an invoice for a party I was working and at the very bottom, written in pen, the owner’s wife/co-owner wrote “tip x 0.78 = tip for server”. That’s 22% of my gratuity. On top of that they’ve been taking 2% of our gratuity every night to help pay for the credit/debit card transactions. The fact that the owners are taking our tip money because they need spending money infuriates me. Especially considering we already share 25% with the support service staff.

Edit: Thanks all for the advice. My plan now is to confront one of the owners about it and make sure to record what’s said. Updates to come later.

Haven’t pulled the trigger yet because even with both jobs money is tight. Being trained to bartend at the new place and from the looks of it, once I’m done with my training, the money from that will sustain me enough so that I can quit the restaurant in question.

"Daycare Provider Shakedown TLDR at bottom

We have 2 kids, 5 and 2.  Live in Minnesota.

Had a family member that ran a daycare, but they retired.  We get a new home daycare provider last April.  Seems fine, 5 goes back to school and leaves daycare until summer or school breaks.  2 continues.  Then we get to MEA break for school, 5 attends daycare for 2 days(wed-thu).  We are informed on thursday that 5 ""kicked a girl in the head"" and would not be allowed back.  When 5 was picked up by my mother(the normal person who picks her up), she asked for details on the incident.  Was met with hostility, provider claimed she could not divulge any info due to hipaa compliance.  That night my wife and I each received an email with a formal termination letter for 5 that stated the reason being shes a ""poor fit for her program"", no mention of the incident.  Also added that she would not stand for harassment from a third party that is not a guardian, and if we decided only having 1 child in daycare was a burden, that we should remember her 2 week notice policy in our contract(there is nothing in the contract regarding any notice).

Friday morning rolls around.  Wife drops off 2 at daycare, is told by provider Grandma left 2 outside alone while they were talking the day before(untrue, but only provider has access to ring cameras).  Wife goes to work, receives a call from child protective services requesting a home visit.  2 had been reported as being left home alone.  Grandma has 5 for the day(planned prior).  G and 5 pick up 2 later that day, provider was icy.  5  was afraid to go inside. 

CPS visits this morning, we explain our schedule, she is perfectly content we are fine.  She told us  as reported ""5 said her brother was being left home while she was dropped off for school every day"" and reports must be followed up within 24hrs.  Provider and my immediate family are the only ones that have had contact due to MEA, pretty obvious who reported.  But she KNOWS our schedule.    Somewhere from friday to monday, I was also blocked from the parents group on facebook for the daycare.

We arent really sure what her motivation is, but it feels like she wants us gone now.  Thats whatever, we have a new arrangements.  The problem is, we feel very uncomfortable with her.  We are obviously ending contact with her.  But we have this week prepaid (biweekly payments), and it sounds like she has imagineered a clause in our contract requiring a 2 week notice.  Do we just call the county?  Just walk away from it and hope she doesnt try and collect the next 2 weeks?  We need to collect 2's things, should i call the sheriff for an escort or just abandon them?  This has us feeling like we are cornered, protecting our babies.  Crazy or justified?  What can we do?

"Unpaid Salary - What do I do? I have a payment of $20,000 that is owed to me since I completed my first year working for the company. 

After 1 year, the payment kept getting delayed for months, and then I got to the point where the company told me it was arriving in the next pay cycle (1 week from that email)... then I was ignored and the company shut down supposedly due to the CEO potentially having committed fraud. The next email I got back from the COO completely disregarded my payment and I was just told that I am receiving my PTO hours payout and that's it.

The salary payment was in my offer letter, and I was told over email by the COO ""expect to receive the $20,000 payment for the next pay cycle""... so all the evidence is clearly in my favor.

"I got hit by a city bus that drove off. So I was driving to work about two weeks ago in the left most lane of a road. A city bus was picking up passengers in the bus only lane, leaving 1 entire lane between us. The bus driver merges into the right lane and then immediately into the left lane and into me. I saw this coming and blared my horn and slammed my breaks on to try to get out of the way. I didn’t quite make it. The bus smacked the front of my car off of the road and into the grassy median and drove off. When I saw him leaving I memorized the number and the plate and I called the police. Although I’m still waiting on the report, the officer who responded said I wasn’t at fault since the bus quite obviously merged across two traffic lanes which is backed up by the damage to my car and to the unpleasant skid marks of my car being pushed sideways. The bus driver said that it was unintentional that he left the scene as he didn’t see or hear the crash, I find this odd since not only was my horn blaring, there was a very unpleasant crunch as my car was squished between the bus and the curb as well as a loud bang when my bumper snapped off. Additionally, I was shoved up and into the median which is think catches most people’s eyes when a car is not on the road and when he began his merge, I was far enough up along side the bus to physically see the driver and wasn’t near his blind spot. This all cost about 2500 dollars worth of damage to my car as well as some missed work and a trip to the ER as a precaution by my doctor because I have a history of blood clots and other things- which I’m sure won’t be a cheap bill. All in all I am okay, but I am frustrated. This is the first time they’ve hit me but I’ve almost been taken out by them multiple times and have seen drivers with headphones in, using there phone and driving all over the place prior to this, which I find frustrating.

Okay so, I'm 16 and I have 3 little siblings. They are 12, 10, and 9 if that matters. Currently, we have been overseas for a few years. Our mom came with us, and she is undocumented, so she left the United States with no papers or green card. 

Today she gave me an ultimatum and said I need to talk to my father and tell him to sign papers a governor sent to her digitally so she can come back without any consequences and with my siblings and I, or else she will contact the government and try to get child support and file for 'mental and emotional abuse' because that's ""worse in their eyes."" She has sent my father text messages about it several times but he has ignored her (marriage problems, he doesn't want to talk to her).

He gets $2300 every month, and he literally sends almost every paycheck to us. 400 every week, and an extra 500 for rent. He barely has anything left for himself and my grandma, but somehow he manages. She said once she contacts them, she will be getting $2500 every month immediately and he will be forced to work 16 hours a day, several jobs and no choice. 

Is this true?? Can she actually do this?  He currently has 2 jobs, one watching over his mom (she's sick and in recovery, he gets 500 every two weeks from this which he sends a majority to us) and his normal one where he gets 400 every week.

If it matters, the state my father is in is Minnesota.",legaladvice,t3_dl0ouo
"Roommate stole ADHD. medication Hi /r/legaladvice, last year my college on campus roommate stole 9 of my ADHD medication - a schedule 2 substance. I had no evidence at the time, and dropped it when I threatened to call the cops on him but he wouldnt admit to it. Now he's my friend's roommate, who also takes medication for ADHD. My friend has good reason to believe he also stole his medication. However, like last time, he has no evidence. 

We're both frustrated and want him to face consequences for his actions. We considered baiting him by putting the medication in an easy to find area and waiting for him to come by while pretending to be asleep, then filming him, but were not sure if it would be a good idea from a legal perspective. Alternatively, if that would be too difficult  we could set up a camera on my friends desk, provided its only filming his desk, if that would work. Would like to know what our best  options are, thanks.",legaladvice,t3_dlb3ao
"FMLA as it applies to taking care of my kids while their mother (my girlfriend) is in the hospital Hello, just looking for any kind of advice as I’m getting really anxious about my situation.

We don’t have a good support system so since she’s been in the hospital I’ve had to stay at home and take care of our kids. Am I covered by FMLA for this or can my employer fire me for missing time?

"Roofied by bartender, underage. MD I work in a restaurant, and I had a table of 6 people who said they work at a restaurant/bar close by and each person invited me to hang out at the bar and watch football. The manager was at the table, and he said he would be bartending and I could drink for free.   One guy in particular, I’ll call him Ron, kept saying “bring your friends.” When I arrived at the bar, I was never asked to show ID. The manager poured me my drink and almost instantly after Ron poured me another. I hadn’t even taken a sip of the first drink so I said to him “what’s this for?” and he said “You said you wanted a Jameson and ginger.” Had that drink at about 4:15 and by 5:00 I blacked out. I do not remember a single thing from 5pm until 5am when I woke up with a killer headache, bruises all over my body, and a pretty deep cut on my forehead. I was with my boyfriend at the bar, he didn’t realize I was roofied he thought I had just drank a little too much. We took an Uber home around 7 and I was passed out by 8. I’m underage, 19, but I’m wondering if legal action would help. Bartenders giving roofies to customers is dangerously common in Annapolis. I don’t want this to happen to anyone else. If I hadn’t been with my boyfriend this man definitely would have raped me.  I don’t know if approaching the manager would help because if they are going out to brunch together they must be close.

"[NC] Writ of Possession filed against me and roommate. I'm disabled and didn't know the other guy wasn't paying rent for 3 months Hi. I'm having some tricky issues to work out today.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to do some reading on NC tenant law and see what I can do to help my case.

&amp;#x200B;

I just found out today that the roommate hasn't been paying rent money for 3 months. He owes the complex here $3000. I'm kind of blindsided because I always paid him the money, according to the terms of the roommate addendum he put me on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just found a good spot to move into today. I'm trying my best to scramble and get the logistics together so I can move into that place. Problem is, the writ was filed on the 14th. I was completely unaware. According to my apartment, the sheriff's dept is to come by Thursday the 24th to change locks. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm disabled, bunch of rare medical issues. Is there a way I can make a claim for discretionary stay until after I've moved out? I can prove to the leasing office that I've been paying my share. 

I believe the roommate has been hiding this information from me for some time. Leasing office tells me that there were multiple notes on the door over time, but I only got informed of something being up through email.

&amp;#x200B;

This is incredibly short notice for me. I knew nothing was going wrong. And the leasing office made no attempt to reach out to me until today's email to clarify the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are my options here? As a disabled person, don't I have a right for time until I've secured everything I need to move? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm disappointed that the person I'v ebeen living with the past few months straight up used the money I gave him for rent on other matters.

I'd really appreciate your help in figuring out what to do. I just need some extra time to get my stuff properly moved out before I'm locked out. I did my part all the way through. I also paid a deposit to this guy for 300$. Guess I'm not getting that back if he already owes the apartment 3000$.

"Landlord is harassing me during lawsuit Long story short, I fell into an open hole outside of my apartment when I was walking my neighbors dog. It used to be a flour factory beside the railroad and there was an uncovered utility hole of some sort. It was night and I didn’t see it. 

I ended up tearing a ligament and three tendons in half and needed reconstructive surgery. I filed a lawsuit against my landlord for not maintaining the property. 

My landlord was sued last week and began repairs on the property. Cool, right? 

Today I went outside and there is a giant mural of a red headed girl walking her dog on the building directly across from my apartment THAT LOOKS JUST LIKE ME. If I look out the window, it’s basically all that I see. My landlord owns the building across the street, too.

"A driver (whose car I was in) hit a child and blames me for it. Wants me to pay medical costs. Am I liable? I recently went out on a first date with a guy, who picked me up at my house and drove me to a local brewery. After leaving the brewery we went to, we got in the car and he started backing out. The parking lot was quite busy, on all sides, so he asked me to keep a look out one direction and tell him when it was clear as he backed out of his space. I told him it was clear on my side, and he backed out (without looking to confirm).

Apparently, though, it wasn’t clear. There was an 11 year old boy in the path of his car on the side I’d told him was clear, and he got hit (not killed or gravely hurt thank god - will have a cast for a while, though). Witnesses (outside of the kid’s family) confirmed the kid *was* in my sights the whole duration; he didn’t jump out or dart in the way at the last minute.

I *swear* I didn’t see the kid, but I believe others that he was there the whole time. I guess I had a massive brain fart and somehow didn’t catch him, or maybe I blurted out the word “clear” before I’d fully processed what was in my view. I don’t know; that whole period of time is kind of a blur to me because of the shock/horror of the kid being hit. 

The guy I was with is now blaming me for the accident and is telling me I should reimburse what he’s going to have to pay for the kid’s medical bills; and that if I refuse, I’ll likely be found liable via insurance. I feel bad that I made such a dumb blunder by wrongly blurting out “clear”, but I feel the person most responsible was my date. *He* was the one behind the wheel. *His car* hit and injured the kid. He should have double-checked before blindly backing out of his space.

Is it likely I’ll be found liable or forced to pay for this accident? Is my insurance likely to figure out about this and penalize me? What would be the ideal next steps for me to take?",legaladvice,t3_dlbutc

"[MO] My employer forged my signature on a non-compete contract I've been at my current company for 8 years and am leaving to start my own business with a former co-worker. I brought some clients with me from my last job when I started here, and the ones that are aware that I'm going to work for myself have already made it clear that they're going to follow me. Most of them stayed because they liked the work I personally was doing for them, but had become unhappy with my company itself in the last few years.

I gave my job three months' notice as a courtesy, since I have a few projects I'm finishing up and didn't want to take on new ones and then leave halfway through. That was a week ago. Friday afternoon, I got an email from HR with some generic stuff about our exit policies, plus a reminder about the non-compete clause in my contract.

I never signed a non-compete, and I emailed HR back to let them know. This set off a long string of emails where they kept insisting that I had, and I kept asking to see it. Finally, I got a scanned copy of a non-compete with what appears to be my signature at the bottom.

I KNOW I didn't sign this thing. I got screwed over by a non-compete years and years ago, and I've refused to agree to one ever since. The copy HR sent isn't just a paragraph hidden in a longer contract, either, it's its own separate thing that goes on for pages. There's no way in the world I could have just missed it.

How do I go about proving that I never signed this? The business plan my partner and I came up with depends heavily on keeping clients that have been loyal to us for years, and we didn't figure fighting a lawsuit into our financial arrangements. Any advice would be much appreciated- it's been a pretty panicky weekend over here.

EDIT- This thread is apparently locked so I can't respond to comments, but thank you to everyone who offered advice. To answer a few questions: I've been told that there is a hard copy somewhere in HR's paper files, but that it may take some time to find it. I've asked to see it once they do. My contract terms were mostly discussed in person or over the phone, which in hindsight was stupid of me. I do have my own copies of all my new-hire paperwork and my contract, but I don't have a personal copy of the noncompete. It's dated several days after I signed everything else, but still before my official start date.

"Identity Theft/Scam through Phone \[US-Maryland\]

So earlier today my dad was scammed by some call center Indians. They said they were from SSN and threatened him with all this hectic bs that he fell for it and he lost about $3.3k.

They were able to get the money by making him deposit the money from his bank account to a Target gift card and send them the gift card info. They were able to actually take only $3.3k out of $7.8k money he deposited into Target gift cards. So the rest $4.5k is safe and it came from his credit card thus he is planning on getting that money back to his credit card account.

He contacted Target to file a claim that he has been scammed. Would Target insure him? I think he can file a claim through FTC but I am not sure I would like clarification in this.

They didn't get access to any of his bank accounts nor any of his bank account numbers.

They also made him give is SSN, name and address and all that personal info stuff. I am most worried about his SSN theft and identity theft. We filed a report to our local police and they took some info and referred us to file a claim with the Social security office.

I already helped him out with filling out a Fraud Allegation Reporting with OIG (Office of the General Inspection, SocialSecurity Administration).

He has yet to contact the Social Security Office, which he will do tomorrow. Contact the IRS to report the theft, place a fraud alert on his credit score and also contact the bank account he withdrew the money from. Would Banks also help out with Insurance if a Scam/Fraud like this happens?

I am most worried about his Identity theft, the consequences \[especially in the future\] and the compromises it could make with our Immigration process.

"Can I sue a dentist and is it worth it? I went to get a routine filling in July . It was botched and the pain never went away. I called the dentist multiple times telling them it still hurt after a week, then 2 weeks, then 4. They kept telling me that sometimes it can take 6 weeks to feel better. 6 weeks later I went in still unable to chew on that side due to pain. They said the tooth looked fine and it was probably just because I grind my teeth and to get a bite guard. I got a bite guard and 1 week later it still hurt. I went to another dentist for a second opinion and he said it definitely shouldn't still hurt enough to make my whole body jerk when he poked it with a metal pick, which is what happened at the exam. So he pulled out the old filling and put in a temporary filling to let the swelling go down. 

Then, my life fell apart. I suddenly had to move across the country on 3 days notice. This was 2 weeks ago.It took until now to have time to follow up and get the temp filling replaced with a permanent one. But...the pain never went away. It was still sore and sensitive but just less. 

The dentist I saw in my new state is telling me there is that the nerve is close enough to the cavity that there is likely an infection brewing and now I need a root canal and crown which is going to cost 2000.

Due to my life falling apart and the move, I forgot to re enroll in my dental plan. I'm not perfect. I just missed it. I was focused on much more urgent matters. So now I will have to pay the whole thing which is impossible.

If the first dentist had not messed up the filling and then dismissed my concerns multiple times when I tried to get help, I would not need a root canal. I want this first dentist to pay for it.

Is it possible to do this, or worth it, or will it cost more in lawyer fees? Is there a different pathway than usual, such as small claims court? Should I just suck up my bad luck and go into more debt?

(Side note: I don't even know if I'd get money. This first dentist was recently in the news because a disgruntled patient set fire to their office and destroyed it. They probably have no assets now anyway. The guy was a total dickhead to me because I have anxiety and he probably kept dismissing my concerns because he thought I was just some anxious woman complaining.

She says there is a number I can call to resolve the debt before she serves me papers. I collected debts for 8 years, and I've run my own process serving company for 7 years. Obviously, no legitimate process server is going to warn someone they are serving legal documents to so you can call and pay the bill because then the process server doesn't get paid.

The driver got out, checked the damage, we basically discussed how it was negligible and he drove off. He obviously lodged the accident with his postal company because later they sent me letters asking for payment for damages. 

I had a look at their report and there was a whole heap of work done on the car that they were charging for that obviously had nothing to do with the accident ie opposite side door panel needed to be replaced and panels and bumpers at the front of the car etc. Areas that definitely were not affected by the accident.

I was insured so I took it up with my insurance company who paid them out regardless. At the time I also mentioned to my insurance company that they were clearly charging for damage that had nothing to do with the accident. Anyway my insurance paid them out so as far as I was concerned this was dealt with. 

Fast forward several months 

I've received a letter today from a law firm basically saying in the matter of Postal company v huck they confirm that my insurer has paid them ~1.5k however they intend to treat that as a part payment are looking for another ~1k 
And they've attached their bank details at the bottom of the page, cheeky gits.

What should I do?

I don't know if there were any witnesses to the actual accident but one man came out of his house shortly after, I'm not sure he saw the postal van' s damage as the van driver might've driven off already however I could track him down if need be.

I also called the police after the accident and they showed up but again the postal van had left by then. 

I don't know if I should get a lawyer involved myself, do I take it that seriously at this stage?

"Roommate left without notice and now his mother is harassing me to pay him back his share of October rent and the security deposit. Back in August my friend and I got a house together, renting it, and we came to multiple verbal agreements before he moved in all of which he disregarded as soon as he moved in. One of which was that we would give each other at least one month's notice if we wanted to leave early. After him being here only a few weeks we started having issues mostly around a mutual friend of ours and his mental state started to slip. He went back home for a couple weeks, got some medical help and before he came back we were talking and I tried to make a deal with him that if he wanted to move back in with his parents I would paying back security deposit. We never came to an agreement because immediately after I made that offer he started getting nasty over text and I ended the conversation. the next day while I'm at work my neighbor texted me telling me that there's a moving truck out front. I knew what it was, when I got home everything was gone the place was a mess but nothing was damaged. 3 days later his mom starts texting me asked if I could send him a few things that he forgot and that I need to pay him back in full by the end of the year. I told her I have no responsibility or obligation to pay him back. When he was here he broke the law and broke several agreements we had and left without notice. She continued to harass me over the course of about 2 weeks and finally I offered to give him $50 per paycheck until it is paid off. She kept saying that wasn't enough.

"Home Seller Disclosure Forms and Seller Liability- Real Estate Law, Ohio On August 30, 2018, my wife and I closed on our current house. The house was at the very top of our price range, but the seller had to lower the selling price quite a bit so we thought it was a good deal for us. About 2 months after the closing, I found undisclosed termite damage in the detached garage. It looked as though the seller had tried to hide the termite damage behind some large lawn tractor attachments they left behind, but I could not prove it and we had opted not to have a termite inspection prior to the sale. That cost us an additional $1000 for inspection and treatment. A few weeks later we found out the heat from the house's heat pump (heat and AC combo) did not work. We had a pre-purchase home inspection but it was July and 90º at the time. $6500 for a new heat pump. We really couldn't afford these unexpected expenses buying at the top of our price range, but we have managed. However, these and a few smaller issues led us to believe that the seller of our home was not dealing in good faith and may have broken the law.

Flash forward to a month ago when I came home from work to find surveyor's stakes in my front yard. The stakes had something about sewers hand written on them in Sharpie. It turns out the metropolitan sewer district is installing a public sewer line on our street (neighbors and I currently have a septic systems) and when complete, we will be forced to connect our homes to the new sewer line and remove the septic tanks from our yards at our own expense. According to the sewer district construction manager and word of mouth, this hook up will cost us around $8000-$10000 per house and is not optional. To make things even more frustrating, the only repair we asked the seller to cover after the inspection period, was a $1500 septic system repair.

So, does the seller of our home have any liability for the costs of connecting to the new sewer if they were informed of the planned sewer line installation and subsequent, associated expenses and did not disclose any of this on the formal home seller's disclosure form?

TL/DR: Does a home seller legally need to disclose if they were informed that a new public sewer line is being installed and the home buyers will be forced to connect to the new sewer at their own expense?",legaladvice,t3_dl1xz8

"Landlord vs Tenant Washing Machine Dispute A few months ago, the front loading washing machine in the apartment I'm renting started making an interesting noise and was not spinning properly (I've lived here for 1.5 years and the machine is over 6 years old). I immediately notified my landlord who told me that she was happy I told her so soon, and that potentially this mishap would be covered by her 'appliance warranty' she had. 

About a week later, a technician who was sent from the warranty service arrived, spent 1 minute looking at the machine then said ""this looks to be an overloading issue"", and left the apartment. A few days after that I got a message from the landlord saying that because the tech identified this as an overloading issue, the maintenance to the machine would not be covered by the warranty service and therefore I would be responsible for paying for the repair. 

I took a week or two to respond to her as I have been extremely busy with work and other life events, and in that time she decided to visit (with my permission) and take a look at the machine. She tried telling me that the warranty service ""Highly recommends that we don't repair as these things often go wrong"" and that I ""should buy a new machine"" and since this model (LG WM2455HG) is discontinued I would ""need to buy a matching dryer because this is a set"". Meanwhile, I have a copy of that voicemail from the warranty service and there is literally no part of the message that recommends not repairing the machine.

While the landlord was here I told her I was going to get another opinion from a technician not sent from a biased warranty service to which she agreed. I have the tech coming later this week.

My question is this: Who is in the right here? If the tech finds that this was caused by any depreciation of the asset, could I take her to court if she still tries to make me pay for her appliances.

NOTE - I've included the word for word portion of my lease that deals with appliances below:

'Appliances: Tenant shall keep all appliances and equipment in good and clean condition, with the exception of reasonable wear and tear. Tenant shall not install or use any other major appliances or equipment in the Dwelling Unit without prior written permission of Landlord.'

"Friable asbestos in a Washington state rental? Hi all, I'm not having luck doing a Google search for landlords' legal obligation to their tenants regarding friable asbestos.

&amp;#x200B;

I rent a basement bedroom that had duct pipes running overhead with a coating that is degrading substantially.  With asbestos, the idea is that if it's in-tact, you leave it alone, but if it's degrading and the fibers are friable (able to get into the air) then you deal with it.  

&amp;#x200B;

So I called up a Seattle-based asbestos remediation company and sent them a photo of the asbestos-coated pipes.  The reply I got is something like, ""that does not look safe and you should have this dealt with"".  They recommend encapsulation rather than removal and that I talk with the landlord.

I'm hoping that when I speak with the landlord that he'll do the right thing and pay to get it fixed.  But I'd like to know what his legal obligation is, in case he objects.

&amp;#x200B;

The lease has the following paragraph:

\&gt;Properties built before and during the late sixties and early seventies may have had lead based products and asbestos products used in them.  These products were considered to be safe at the time, just as the building products used today are considered safe for home construction. Only the test of time will show which products are or are not safe to use. Having read the above, the tenant signs the lease below with the full understanding that these conditions may be present in this property. The tenant and all parties associated with this property relieves the owner, property manager, and any of his agents from any responsibilities for these conditions regardless of when or how these conditions were caused.  You also acknowledge receiving the EPA Booklet ""Protect Your Family from Lead In Your Home"" prior to your original lease agreement.

"New Bar Forming from Restaurant, Need Advice on Partnership Michigan, USA

Genuine business advice needed please.

My wife and I (one American, one Chinese) have been working at a Chinese restaurant here in the US and have befriended the owners. The restaurant has a full bar and liquor license with capacity for \~50 at the bar area alone, but currently does zero bar business as no one wants to drink in a Chinese restaurant, understandably. The idea is to build a couple of small walls within the restaurant, a new front door for the bar, and a new bar name and sign, creating a separate space and new brand. A new bar. The owner wants us to run the bar from top to bottom, basically managing all aspects. The kitchen and bathrooms are shared with the restaurant. The entire combined space is on a lease but this project has landlord approval.

We are meeting in a few days to discuss the financial details, but he has hinted already about us putting some money into the renovation as a way to show our long term commitment to the project, but also mentioned giving us a percentage of all bar profits as well. Basically we'd be buying what may be a good chunk of equity for as little as $5000. Very little was discussed thus far, but we will be finalizing all details before beginning construction. But everything is on the table and up for negotiation from equity split, to hourly pay, to who buys inventory etc etc.

Some PROS include the ability to fully design and operate a bar from menu to decor with very little investment. A potential for profit that scales with our efforts. A good learning experience. A bar that needs very little rehab to bring it up to par.

Some CONS include the restaurant owner having the liquor license which could get revoked by some mishap on the restaurant side. The kitchen not being able to handle the influx of new food orders, or some other kitchen mishaps such as quality etc. Among numerous other things that may be outside of our control.

Also of note, we have, combined some bar management and bar-tending experience and the location is within a couple of miles of a handful of successful bars and has a large population that is fairly well off.  We also have some financial breathing room so the success or failure of this project won't make or break us.

I would love to hear any advice on how to create this partnership and whether or not investing our money up front makes sense. We would love the opportunity to do this, but don't want to be hung out to dry either. Thanks for any opinions positive or negative. Don't be gentle.

I have a completely clean record, take the metro to work everyday, this was a complete misunderstanding.

I'm going through the process of getting a Secret Clearance, and I'm curious to hear what could happen if I am found guilty of fare evasion/should I hire an attorney or should I try to represent myself?

I've spoken to a good amount of people with active clearances and they are all telling me to avoid paying insanely high legal fees since the court date is tomorrow and that I should just represent myself, and if the case does not get dismissed and I am found guilty of fare evasion it shouldn't really affect my clearance at all.

So the first couple of scary scenes weren’t so bad. Although I got a lot of water sprayed on me. At one point I got water basically poured on me. Then we went to another room for the next experience. In this next room, I was strapped to a chair and basically electrified for about 1-2 minutes. It was almost none stop. They gave us a safe word, but I couldn’t scream the safe word. The shocks were so strong I couldn’t think or even focus on what was happening. The employees gave no direction until the electrifying started happening. There were 4 rounds of shocks. My friends were only shocked once, whereas I was shocked all 4 times. It was agreed in our friend group that the electric shocks were way too strong. It wasn’t just a single buzz, there were strips on the back of the chair and on the seat as well. And it actually caused me a ton of pain after we finished that one. 

Now, the employees weren’t the ones causing the shocks, we were, but there was no instruction given until the shocks started happening. The entire moment happened so quickly, and by the time they started telling us what to do we were all in a panic. Mind you, I was screaming my fucking head off. My friends agreed that they also had no idea what was happening and they could not hear any directions from the employees. 

I understand that I put myself in this situation  when I signed the waiver but I was being shocked to the point where I couldn’t speak. There was no chance for me to get out of that situation. I know that they are very much prepared in their waiver for something like this but is there anything I can do? Is it legal for them to do this even with a waiver? My bf thinks that there is something we could do as to the fact that they had sprayed water on us before electrifying us. I know that there might not be anything I could do, but I’m just curious as to if this is actually legal. 

Is it legal to pour water on customers and then electrify them after?",legaladvice,t3_dl7fcm
"TRO cali, ex-gf [California] CA

I was served with a tro. The basis of the tro was that I had thrown a bottle at her and that I went I to her house twice. There was no witness besides her and I. She on the report said we had broken up after the argument but that is a lie I been with her for emotional support. I entered her house with no intention of harm she had shown me how to enter her house and she also given me a key to her house. She did not say I harmed her in any situation. The bottle was not thrown at her but towards the ground because of my frustration. We continued to talk after that but her dad had been threatening me and said that he was going to get a restraining order against me. Long story short she ended up getting and I had to drop 3 of my five college classes because of it.

 I believe that her dad is forcing this on her and I just want it all to go away. Her father is not in the us legally and i was thinking of getting a tro against him. He has threaten me and has called my mom many times saying nasty things about me. He is a man that wants to control every aspect of his daughters and wife's life. He is working on getting his green card. How will this affect him? I care about him but i am also scared of him.

"[CT]Serving someone in Small Claims I'm suing my old LL for my security deposit, detailed in my prior posts. CT law states there are 4 ways of serving someone. I opted for ""certified mail, return receipt requested"". All the methods are in the link I posted below.

As far as I can see, all these methods except hiring an officer essentially require the Defendant to willingly accept the package. My LL should be expecting I'm suing them as I sent a demand letter. The letter containing the court documents needed to be served should have been delivered already but since they didn't accept the package (probably didn't answer the door) it's just sitting in the post office on the miracle they pick it up willingly.

"4 Year Old Niece Living in Meth Lab I need some legal advice as to what my rights are concerning my niece.

My brother passed away from an opioid overdose 4 years ago, but before he did he got his girlfriend pregnant. She gave birth to a baby girl who is now three years old. I'll call her Emma.

We suspected that his girlfriend had done drugs, but thought she was on the straight and narrow with a steady job. My family has kept in touch with the mother, Mary, in order to be in Emma's life. However, for a couple months now we have not been able to get in touch with Mary and her phone has been disconnected. I checked on her social media and it was riddled with depression posts.

My mother finally got a call yesterday saying that Mary has gone down a terrible path. She is now operating a meth lab out of a trailer and is on drugs (most likely heroine, meth, fentanyl) with her current boyfriend. Clearly, this is an awful abusive situation for my poor niece to be growing up in.

Apparently, CPS has been called, but no action has been taken. My mother, from my understanding, has the best claim to Emma as her grandmother, but is unwilling to raise her. Even though I am fresh out of undergrad and just starting a career, I feel it is my responsibility to try to get her out of this terrible situation and provide her with a home. Although I am not completely financially independent yet, I should be in a year or two. Additionally, I have a stable household with a husband and a lovely dog.

What are my options? How should I proceed?

"[CA] A driver (whose car I was in) hit a child and blames me for it. Wants me to pay medical costs. Am I liable? I recently went out on a first date with a guy, who picked me up at my house and drove me to a local brewery. After leaving the brewery we went to, we got in the car and he started backing out. The parking lot was quite busy, on all sides, so he asked me to keep a look out one direction and tell him when it was clear as he backed out of his space. I told him it was clear on my side, and he backed out (without looking to confirm).

Apparently, though, it wasn’t clear. There was an 11 year old boy in the path of his car on the side I’d told him was clear, and he got hit (not killed or gravely hurt thank god - will have a cast for a while, though). Witnesses (outside of the kid’s family) confirmed the kid *was* in my sights the whole duration; he didn’t jump out or dart in the way at the last minute.

I *swear* I didn’t see the kid, but I believe others that he was there the whole time. I guess I had a massive brain fart and somehow didn’t catch him, or maybe I blurted out the word “clear” before I’d fully processed what was in my view. I don’t know; that whole period of time is kind of a blur to me because of the shock/horror of the kid being hit. 

The guy I was with is now blaming me for the accident and is telling me I should reimburse what he’s going to have to pay for the kid’s medical bills; and that if I refuse, I’ll likely be found liable via insurance. I feel bad that I made such a dumb blunder by wrongly blurting out “clear”, but I feel the person most responsible was my date. *He* was the one behind the wheel. *His car* hit and injured the kid. He should have double-checked before blindly backing out of his space.

Is it likely I’ll be found liable or forced to pay for this accident? Is my insurance likely to figure out about this and penalize me? What would be the ideal next steps for me to take?",legaladvice,t3_dlbz1c
"Neighbor’s dog attacked mine My shih tzu was in our fenced backyard and the neighbor’s pit bull broke through the fence and mauled our dog.

She ended up with a broken leg (which may have to be amputated) and a ton is open wounds that had to be sutured up. Our vet bill for the night was over $1,000 and it seems like it’s about to get worse.

"Florida Sublease problem My brother and I recently got into a sublease with a man that leases out multiple rooms in an apartment complex in Miami Beach (he isnt the landlord). My brother and I are  sharing a room and each paying half for the room. We both have subleases with him.

About a week into living there our Leasor said it was very ""cramped"" and that basically too many people would be living in this apartment so he offered a couple other rooms to us. He didnt force us but he STRONGLY urged us too. We  took the room that was the same price in the same apartment building, while not changing the lease. As to not be so ""cramped"" as he said.

I swear we have been here for less than a week and now he is offering us another room that is about $50 dollars more expensive a month. We told him we were comfortable here and THATS WHEN he said his landlord would ""increased"" his rent by $650 if he renewed his lease so he doesnt think he will and he needs 1-2 days to think about it...

This is extremely inconvient for us and is  short notice as we owe him money Nov 1...in about 9 days.

Our current subleases are until early February. I know that you all need as many details as possible about the sublease. It is very basic, only a page with 6 bullet points. I will be doing some significant paraphrasing.

1. date sublease agreement ends on (he left this blank)
2. Talking about how we pay utilities
3. How we need to leave the place in good condition when we leave
4. How the deposit is for any damages
5. the sublessor will make a check-in sheet
6. (Verbatim what is said)     The sublease agreement incorporates and is subject to the original lease agreement between the sublessor and his lessor, a copy of which is attached hereto, ad which is hereby referred to and incorporated as if it were set out here at length. The subtenant agrees to assume all of the obligations and responsibilities of the sublessor under the original lease for the duration of the sublease agreement.

&amp;#x200B;

We are tired of him moving us around so much and we think he is lying about his landlord increasing the price. We are fearful that if we do not take this room he will not give us our deposit back and we need to think quickly because he has only given us 9ish days.

"Got scammed, not sure what to do, Ireland So I bought some diet pills from company A (I know, I know they don't work but they were really flooding my instagram so I thought I'd give them a try for one month but I didn't expect them to work) the first month was 5eu and they said I could cancel at any time,

 I forgot to cancel it the second month and when I received the second pack I sent them an email expressing my wish to cancel and they replied saying that my subscription has been cancelled. Great.

&amp;nbsp;

Next month I get a pack once again, I'm like ?? So I send them another email with their previous reply attached saying yo I cancelled can you make sure my details are off your system. They replied saying oh so sorry you're having this difficulty blah blah shipping and handling is non-refundable. But like I looked in my bank transactions and didn't see anything with the name of company A so I thought they sent it to me by mistake, I didn't think they charged me anything cause I didn't see it.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway come to today and there it is, another pack of pills. So this time I take a proper long look at my transactions and after looking up some names I didn't recognise I see a companyB.com has charged me 100eu this month and last month. I go see the site and it's some rejuvenating cream I have never ever heard of from a company I never heard of and I have never been to that site before.

First thing I do is call my bank about it and well the best thing they can do is block any further transactions, but like that's 200eu gone.

 I have looked and looked and company A website has no address, no other company mentioned or anything, it just has a customer support email and a customer support phone number. 

Company B has different support email, it has some compay C name with an Irish address underneath AND ***the same customer support phone number as company A***

"Of Spendthrifts and Inter Vivos Trusts. Your Insights are Appreciated! I filed for bankruptcy in March, In July my Step Father died triggering the termination of a trust containing my brother and I's childhood home to be dispersed to my brother and I 50/50.  I of course am in 180 days of bankruptcy and the trustee recently subpoenaed us with a complaint in order to compel my brother to sell his share.

I have done some research and have come across some compelling case law.  I am no lawyer, but a psych clinician so I do alright with spidery language, however, I am hardly a pro.  And please note I have already retained litigation council.  But I want an idea of an answer sooner than later as this is stressing my brother out badly.

My mother created this trust shortly before her death, even though she knew she was dying, she worded it to be inter vivos and transferred ownership of her property into this trust irrevocably with instructions it was to support her and her husband, until whomever last died at which point it would terminate and be dispersed to my brother and I.  She died shortly after, and as noted above my step dad years later.

So in some preliminary research I come across Re Newman  [https://casetext.com/case/matter-of-newman](https://casetext.com/case/matter-of-newman)  for easy reference:

The spendthrift in our trust is identical to the one cited in that case.  And to my understanding this is a heavily cited case in bankruptcy law when it comes to matters like this, and has continued to be upheld.  The debtor has no right to claim interest in the trust, and to my understanding until such a time as the property is actually distributed from the trust, the spendthrift holds.  In addition too since the spendthrift excludes the trust at time of filing, and I am not receiving it by bequest, devise, or inheritance it doesn't apply even though it terminated within 180 days.  I should note the property to this day remains in trust.

My state recognizes spendthrifts.

This seems further bolstered by Re Fetter  [https://casetext.com/case/in-re-fetter](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-fetter) :

However, the Trust with its spendthrift provision was in force on the date of the filing of Debtor's petition. As a consequence, Section 541(c)(2) excepts any interest the Debtor had in the Trust  from property of the estate.

Much of the Trustee's argument implicitly relies on the fact that the Settlor died within 180 days of the petition date. That fact is a bit of a red herring. Section 541(a)(5), which brings into the estate property which is acquired within 180 days after the filing of the petition, applies only to property received ""by bequest, devise or inheritance."" Property received from a trust during the 180 days following the filing of a bankruptcy petition is not received as a result of ""bequest, devise, or inheritance."" *See* In re Newman, [903 F.2d 1150, 1154](https://casetext.com/case/matter-of-newman#p1154) (7th Cir. 1990); In re Roth, [289 B.R. 161, 166-67](https://casetext.com/case/in-re-roth-40#p166) (Bankr. D. Kan. 2003).

&amp;#x200B;

The only real nuance I see is thus:  My mother the settler died years before my bankruptcy, in Fetter the settlor died in the 180 days. Triggering termination of trust and transfer of property.  In this case it was a life interest my step father who died triggering termination and transfer then.  Would this deviation affect my case?  Or is it not actually based on when the settlor dies, but rather the event that final triggers termination?  Also does my identical spendthrift to Re Newman hold water in a state that honors spendthrifts?

"Planning to drop out and cut ties with my parents without their knowledge, is this legal? (New York) Hi, I really need some information on how I could go about this. 


I’m currently a freshman in college, failing miserably. I’m planning on withdrawing completely and I have a friend that I’m planning on staying with. I have been planning on cutting ties with my family for some time now, and since I’m 18 it’s possible. There’s only one problem: financial aid. 


My parents co-signed for FAFSA and Excellsior, and even co-signed for a private bank loan. Since I was unable to sign as an independent, I didn’t have the option to cut them out of the equation financially. The private loan and Excellsior aren’t the problem, FAFSA is. There has been no clear information on if I’m allowed to. I’m unsure on if I’m even allowed to do this. My friend said I should send them a letter stating that they’re only allowed to contact me for financial aid reasons, or to forward me any information so that I can pay everything off independently. 


Could they sue me? Is this legal?",legaladvice,t3_dkvn6p

I had just moved into my new apartment, and on the first day opened a kitchen drawer and found what appeared to be a bunch of cloth rags bound by a black cord. I opened it, and found myself holding blood stained rags, needles, a lighter and some cue tips. I freaked out, especially because I had a small cut on my finger that I believe was from the day before. I contacted my local hospital, and they recommended I see a doctor in the ER right away. That evening I went in, and was given a blood test for HIV and hep, as well as given Hep vaccinations and a tetanus vac. The bills came to me recently, and even with insurance, they are over 2k. 

I spoke with my landlord the day of the incident, and she was able to figure out it was the handyman who left his drug stuff there. The day of I did make it clear to her in passing that I was planning to go see a doctor, but I'm not sure how much of that she absorbed.

"Child hurt at school by staff member As the title says, my child was hurt at school today by a staff member.  Location is in Texas, for any locally relevant laws.  This is a public school.  Throwaway because that's what all the cool kids do.

While waiting for dismissal, the kids line up in a hallway waiting to be released outside to their parents.  During this time, custodians started moving in and out of the building prior to the children leaving, which is a little unusual, but I figured they're just trying to clean something up.  As they're bringing in their rolling trash cans and trying to squeeze by the kids, my child's hand gets smashed in the door frame.  I didn't see the actual event take place as there was a lot of movement, but within moments of it happening I could see their face through the glass and they were in agony.  A teacher immediately escorted my child out to me and related what had happened, which my child independently corroborated.  I went to the principal's office to file a complaint due to their negligence, and went home.

My wife and I monitored our child's hand over the evening, and the swelling continued to worsen and bruise, at which point we went to urgent care to get Xrays done.  Imaging revealed that my child has a fracture in one of their fingers, and was referred to Ortho in addition to recommending they stay home from school because they're going to be in a lot of pain over the next couple days.  Doctor additionally noted that they may lose the fingernail, but it was too early to say for sure one way or the other and they just wanted me to be aware of potential outcomes.

So, my question comes out to, what kind of recourse do I have against the school here, if any?  I don't yet know what all medical costs we're likely to incur yet, nor any potential lost wages from me needing to take her to appointments on short notice.  Past any potential monetary award, I want to ensure that there's some type of repercussion for what happened today, as this is an unacceptable situation and even if it's an honest mistake, it's still negligent behavior if somebody who is employed at an elementary school doesn't have the awareness to realize there are small children around them.

"[NV] Employee Misclassification? To make this short and sweet, I was hired as a 1099 at an agency two years ago and I've since left. I filled out a 1099- MISC and signed a contract that also indicating that I was a contractor and not an employee. However, I'm pretty sure I was being treated as one. My boss would repeatedly tell me what to do and how to do it. If I didn't want to be at an off-site location anymore, she explicit stated to me that she will ""relive"" me when the newest contractor was able to.

I was told I had to attend weekly staff meetings (without pay) and when I didn't show for them, I was told that I had to notify her and provide a reasoning to why I was not at the meeting. She never explicitly asked me for a doctor's note, but she has asked me if I was given medication.

"$10,000 to Break an Apartment Lease in TX 6 months ago, I moved to Austin, Texas with a very good tech job. About 2 months in, my company let me go and half of my former department was hollowed out. Needless to say, this was a very rocky start, and moreover I had a terrible liability on my hands... a 1 bedroom apartment that cost $2,000 a month with another 10 months on the lease. While this was well within my means at the time, being unemployed for 4 months burned my cash reserves down to a small fraction of what it was. Finally, after 4 months, I found a decent job halfway across the country and began making arrangements to leave and at least begin to rebuild my career and life. 

When I decided to go to the leasing office to try to get out of the contract, I realized that I didn't have enough to even cover the next month's rent, but regardless, I felt I could no longer stay in Texas as it would be financially ruinous for me. The company told me that to break the lease would cost me in excess of $10,000. 

**The three factors they are considering here:**

(a) A 60-day written notice that I'm leaving;

(b) A termination fee of 2 months’ total rent;

(c) The return of any discounts on the retail price of the apartment for the months I've been there

&amp;#x200B;

Two Questions:

1. Being that I am well beyond my means to pay, what recourse(s) if any, do I have to prevent this from severely damaging my credit?
2. Do I have any legal ability to negotiate this number down given my inability to pay and, if so, how would a lawyer typically go about this?",legaladvice,t3_dlat5d

There was an episode tonight and we picked up the middle child. We already decided to call cps tomorrow. The mother is military so we are also nervous she will talk her way out of it, despite the abuse. I’m sure the mother needs mental help. There is a lot of sketchy things going on including government assistance fraud which we will also report.

So I guess I have two questions.
Despite the emotional abuse, is there a chance they will be sent back?

"‘My mom took $15,000.00 out of my savongs to pay for her new car, I need advice’ ORIGINAL POST By: /u/ThrowRAEctellion

LINK TO ORIGINAL POST: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dl02bm/my_mom_took_15000_out_of_my_savings_to_pay_for_a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

‘So I will try and keep this short.

I have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced I chose to live with her, I have always trusted her and so on.

Now we have never been rich, but we got by, I have always worked since I could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

Now because of this I quickly started saving my money, pretty much, I would usually save up at least half of what I made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when I moved out and such.

So I turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so I wanted to see how much I had saved.

Well you can see where this is going, I looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so I freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""Some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so I yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. She started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. I know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, I mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. My dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

Well this was 2 weeks ago, I have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

In the meantime I have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

Now here is what I said, untill I have every penny back I wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do I doubt I will ever forgive her. 

I need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.’",legaladvice,t3_dlas7m

"Landlord giving issues about a security deposit I’m going to try to to make this very simple but the situation is a little complicated. 

Basically, my family and I(17) lived in a home for 4 years and we rented from an individual owner. We cleaned the house thoroughly but there are of course normal wear and tear (carpets becoming dirtier, paint chips, etc). There was also a pool, and a large backyard with fruit trees. This is where the issues arise. 

The pool had become green. 
We complained numerous times that the pool system was not working, and despite us running the system and spending 100s of dollars on chemicals to kill the algae the pool still looked terrible. 
We drained the pool and refilled it and it still wasn’t great, but it was a lot better. 
When we moved out the pool was still slightly green but the rest of the house was ship shape (much cleaner than when we moved in). 

After the walk through our land lord told us (in writing) that we would be receiving our pro rated rent ($1225) and a portion of our security deposit. We had originally paid a $2000 security deposit but would only be getting back $950. After the debacle of moving we decided that we would agree on that number and not really fight it. 
Now a week later he informed us that he believes that “the pool and yard were severely neglected...the trees hadn’t been watered in months...I will not be returning any of the security deposit.” 
This is all BS. The trees have been watered and still make fruit, the pool hasn’t been neglected by US but by HIM, since he was informed of all the issues but chose to do nothing about it when we lived there.

"[Colorado] - Car Crash Claim Question Location:  Colorado

Earlier this month I got rear ended on the highway causing enough damage to legally call my truck totaled. I was found not at fault at the accident. I filed a claim with the insurance of guilty party had and I'm currently in the process of settling with them. 

On to my question and concern. About a month and week before the accident, I had engine work done on my truck costing me $4259. The insurance company evaluated my truck to be around $4200. After submitting my receipts for the engine work done.  They offered a reimbursement of only $751 which is my main point of contention.

 Do I have a legal standing to get more reimbursed by the insurance company or do I need to go to small claims court? I only want a fair reimbursement/payout for the mechanical work done. I am not looking to get the full amount nor 17.7% which what the initial offer was. 

If it helps my truck was 2001 Dodge Dakota 4.7L V8 5-speed manual.  On that note, do claim adjusters use the Kelly Blue Book value when determining the payout for a total car? I looked through their documents on how they reached the settlement offer. They used three *identical* trucks from nearby dealerships to evaluate the worth of mine. I found two of the three trucks they used and listed price the adjuster had put in was not close to the price the dealership was listing them as.

Edit:
I've talked to a lawyer recommended by a friend of mine. He gave me advice on how to proceed on the settlement and to bring up loss of use.

"Former landlord/tenant dispute USA State; Al.
I am being wrongfully accused of criminal mischief. My former apartment owners accused me of stealing and rendering my last apartment useless.
The truth is that I spent over $2k fixing the apartment up prior to moving in there because it was a fire hazard waiting to happen (I have bank records showing my valence at the time I moved in as well as all receipts &amp; text messages between myself &amp; the former owner). I informed the owners at the time that I was upgrading all these things since I planned to stay a few years and they stated it was fine as long as the old furnishings were kept so if I moved and took my things, they had the old fixtures. The maintenance man kept the old fixtures.

Then the property changed owners.
The new owners stated that my agreement was void since they bought the place. I informed them that I never made the agreement with them and that in fact I would be taking the $2k in furnishings with me.
I did and left old fixtures there.

They filed charges without me knowing anything about it &amp; this past weekend I was informed I had a warrant for my arrest.
I turned myself in to the jail this past Saturday and was booked &amp; released on bail.

Since I was about to get married then go on my honeymoon and I have a child on the way I wasn't looking to spend money on that but was curious for future information. He went out talked it over with the nurse and informed that it would be covered by the visit itself and asked if I wanted him to just remove it real fast.

I agreed, and he did. Since then I have now received a $300 bill for the removal of it and a $1,100 bill for an examination of it (something I was unaware that he was going to do).

I have put in a claim through them to have the charges removed based on the doctor explicitly telling me it would be covered. But since I have nothing other than my word to prove it I don't have a lot of faith that the hospital will take my side over their own doctor.

Do I have any other actions I can take either now or after their ruling?",legaladvice,t3_dl5dkv
"VA - Non-Monetary Contributions I’m a SAHM preparing to get a divorce. I have three toddlers. Our home is 50% paid with SO’s inheritance from an uncle, and we moved into the home 15 months ago. I’d planned not to contest any property equity as I understand how the law works in that regard. However, since separation (5 months into moving), I have cared for the home in its entirety. Daily maintenance, yard work, internal and external repairs. 

I have extensive emails asking SO to assist with things for the house (non-aesthetic things, like safe electrical outlets on our main floor and other safety measures) and he has told me to either pay myself (I have no income) or reimburse him for things I paid for without his permission before he will pay. If I ask him to help with anything, he makes an excuse. For example, I sprained my arm and have asked him to help with minor but necessary pruning and he has said his arm is bothering him as well, so he can’t. He plays baseball twice a week. I’m on an allowance (ie financially cut off, but passive aggressively) and he allocated 75 dollars per month for all home repairs. We have a 4 story, 4 br home that was built in 1943. Our household income is 122k per year and he has extensive inheritance savings as well as a trust. His, but I say this to note his ability to pay for home maintenance (or even for me to do the work that I can do myself) if he weren’t unwilling to do so now that he has left the home. When he was here, he refused to so much as clean after himself or help me with child rearing (care, baths, laundry) once our third was born. 

We have had two formal complaints because of external home issues, and I have handled them both while he has either not responded to emails or replied telling me he can make minor fixes that wouldn’t address the complaints. 

I’m a tiny gal but I drill, saw, whatever I can do myself to not have to pay anyone, while caring for the kids with zero help. Our home is immaculate on the inside. I take the kids to church every Sunday, as well as preschool for the two oldest and activities for all of them. 

I’m wondering if I end up divorcing him, move, and go back to work (which was the plan while married), if I will have to start at zero (also fine in order to be in a healthier situation) or if these things will be relevant to any marital/property settlement. Thx.",legaladvice,t3_dlaacn
"Elementary School abused my 34-lb daughter. We withdraw our child from school. School retaliates calling Child Protective Services on US! [Oregon] My 34-lb kindergartner came home from school with a nasty red bruise on her elbow and other bruises that look like thumbprints.  I assumed my child fell, but she insisted that she was pulled by elbow/arm by a teacher at her school (who turns out is actually a ""Behavior Assistant"") because she wouldn't come in from recess.  I took her to urgent care confirmed this was not from a fall, but instead an injury from a pull or pinch.  I followed-up with my primary care physician, to whom my daughter repeated her story without my prompting, and she also said the injuries are consistent with a physical assault and not a fall.

I called the police and informed the principal and met with both parties.  The police did an investigation, but the ""Behavior/Response to Intervention Assistant"" denied the allegations and claimed my daughter fell (but on the arm that was uninjured).  The police decided they did not have enough evidence to indicate a crime had occurred.  The principal took no immediate action beyond allowing the investigation.  As far as I am aware, there have been no consequences imposed on the alleged abuser.  The school covered the incident up and only the school counselor was informed of the alleged abuse (so no one else knows to keep an eye on abuse from the abusive woman).

I no longer trust the school district, so I withdrew her from school to enroll her in an online school.  In retaliation, the school has called Child Protective Services with an anonymous report.  The claim is that I said that my daughter roams the neighborhood without my supervision.  I never made this statement, and my husband was a witness in this meeting and can attest that this was never said.

Now Child Protective Services wants to visit my home.

Should I let them come to my home?  Are the police likely to get involved further?  Is it legal for the school to completely fabricate a statement I never made in order to weaponize Child Protective Services?  Is there any remedy for this slander and distressing retaliation?

"City said I could replace THEIR sidewalk handrail with MY 6 ft. privacy fence. Should I ask them to pay for the fence? We just bought a house, and one side of our property buts up against a busy street. The street sits about 10 feet above our back yard, so there is a cement retaining wall separating the sidewalk from our yard. On top of that retaining wall sits a 2 foot tall metal handrail, which is the only thing that prevents people from being able to hop into our back yard (or see in it for that matter).

I called the city and spoke with a planner, and they told me that the hand rail looks old and is likely out of code anyways, and they have no problem with me replacing it with a 6 foot privacy fence.

"Property management sent an invoice for “damages” and won’t show us the bill. What do I do? Bit of a long story, sorry in advance.

I am currently renting an apartment in Los Angeles, CA with one other person. 

When my roommate and I moved in (December 2018), we didn’t set up utilities (they were already turned on, we weren’t sure if we needed to or not, we should have asked). 

Our property manager (PM) called us about 4 months after moving in and said we need to set up our own utilities. We then did immediately.

Our PM called us about 3 months later, saying we never set up utilities. We provided proof, and he dropped the matter. 

A month later, PM said we owed a utilities bill of about $600 dollars, and if we didn’t pay it, our power would be turned off. We immediately asked for a copy of the bill, and said once we received a physical copy, we would pay it. 

We never received a physical copy. We followed up with PM through email and texts, and never heard back from him. 

A month passes by, and we receive an email from our property management company with an attached invoice stating:

“Dear Resident:

Enclosed is a copy of a bill for work done in your unit.

As you will see on the enclosed invoice the damage was tenant caused.

Please remit payment immediately in the amount of $415.59 payable to PROPERTY MANAGEMENT.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. 

Sincerely,

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT”

We never had any work done, and we replied asking for a copy of the utilities bill again, and they haven’t responded. It’s been 2 weeks since we’ve received this email. They’ve added the bill amount to our online payment portal, combining it with our monthly rent total.

"Illegal Paycheck Deductions?? Hi! Long story short I have had a lot of minor financial issues with my employer, who is a competitive soccer club, throughout the 4 years I have been working with them. I started this job as a soccer coach for young girls when I was 19, and now I am 23. I let them know I was going to stop coaching after season about two weeks ago, and then they fired me  in the meantime because I was trying to find my girls a team/coach to play with outside of the club after I left... which is so unreasonable and petty we literally had one game left. Anyways, the purpose of this post is to gain insight and multiple perspectives on my current situation with them. I work in the Spring and Fall, three months to a season (the months I get paid are March, April, May and August, September, October). I charge $50 per player, and my roster has ranged from 15-19 girls each season.  In 2017 they started taking 10% out of my paycheck for a ""club fee."" So basically per month I would make $850 per month for a 17 player roster because each parent pays $50 for trainer's fee, but I would only get $765. From 2017-now they have taken a total of $1,515 out of my paychecks for this club fee. I have asked my employer to tell me specifically in writing what this 10% for and have received no response. On my pay stubs it does not break down what the club fee is for either. When the parents pay the trainers fee online, it says nothing about their money being used for anything else. We don’t have practice uniforms, a club practice facility, no team soccer bags, our uniforms are extremely cheap and have stayed same last 4 years, they don’t pay me for gas from traveling back and forth for games. This deduction is solely for the benefit of the employer. Does this seem outrageously sketchy to anyone? I am ironically enrolled in Employment Law and when we started talking about wages and things an employer can deduct, I kind of started to think about my situation. I just never really thought it would actually be happening to me!!! Thank you guys for your help in advance.",legaladvice,t3_dla248

"Being sued for a 3-year old car accident (not at fault) by the passender of the other vehicle. I was involved in a car accident just over three years ago. The traffic light was out long with all street lamps (the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew), so it was a complete blackout and I didn't see the traffic light being out and drove through the intersection. The guy from the other road did as well and I t-boned him. The driver had no driver's license, no insurance or license plate. The driver and passenger both got out after the accident to access the damage then got back in the car before the HW-Patrol came and started to fake injuries. Probably due to no license or insurance. 

Neither of us was at fault due to the light being out of service. I filed a claim with my insurance, got my car fixed and moved on. Now three years later I received documents from the passenger's attorneys suing me along with the driver of the other vehicle and two other people. I believe the driver's mom and someone else. 

A few things to note:

* I have the original dashcam footage from the accident which includes my speed. I was going 42mph along with an illustration of how dark it was due to the traffic &amp; street lights being out. Very easy mistake to make. 
* The plaintiff has an arrest record from last year.
* **The big one I'm concerned about. I'm longer insured with the insurance company that handled the claim.  Who do I contact? My old insurance agency or my current one?**

"(Ontario) The company my cousin worked for sided with the person who sexually assaulted her and let her go after 1 week of employment. What rights does she have? Can she pursue criminal charges against the assailant? The company? So to set it up, she got the job through a recruitment agency and has a lady who she can contact from said agency. She moved from a car insurance sales job to a different but similar company providing such services. 


Only a week in when her and this fella (we’ll call him Stank) and her are working just the two of them. He had made advances which she repeatedly shot down politely, until he decided to just jam his hand up her shirt and kiss her neck. From what she tells me, she flew out of her seat, left the building and hopped the first bus in sight. Stank tried to call her repeatedly following her departure, but to no avail. 


So she contacts both her boss and the recruitment company rep to tell them about the incident...


Needless to say, the outcome was less than ideal and they ended up letting my cousin go, using the excuse that she was late a few times. Stank had been working for the company 5 years strong at this point, and at the end of the day, it came down to a he said she said situation. This feels like a bunch of bullshit in my eyes. I’m naturally infuriated for my cousin over the outcome, but she feels like she doesn’t have any other options and that any attempts to go the police will just be met with indifference and just be wasted energy on an already upsetting situation that would lead nowhere. She’s got the full backing of this recruitment agency and my cousin is still communicating with HR. 


Is there any federal or provincial law or organization that would help with a situation like this? With what seems like no text messaging conversations, recorded phone calls, admission of guilt, security surveillance footage, etc as concrete evidence, is there anything at all that can be done to at least ensure that Stank will think twice before taking advantage of someone else like this?

"(Ohio) Someone in my neighborhood is randomly threatening me with pepper spray About a week ago I was walking my dog in the morning before work. We were on the sidewalk of a pretty busy street. The sidewalk is super wide. We walk by a man I’ve never seen before and my dog gets about 2 feet from him just from walking by him. She does pull but I lock her retractable leash whenever we walk past someone because although she is a cutie and usually people ask to pet her, I’d rather have someone not pet her that wants to than for her to go up to someone who has a traumatic experience with a dog or something of that sort. 

So as we’re walking by him, it takes me a few seconds to realize this, but he pulls out what appears to be pepper spray and points it at my dog. When I realize what he’s doing I pull my dog to the other side and we continue walking. I look behind me at him and say “what the fuck??” And he then points the pepper spray at me. My dog barks, and he points the pepper spray at her again. I just continue walking, at this point we were at least 8 feet away from him. I stopped going that route because I was shocked after that experience. 

Well it doesn’t seem it’s stopped. This morning I decided to go that route again. I spotted him right in the same spot we were before, from about 20 feet away I saw him look at me, immediately pull out the pepper spray from his back pocket, and shake it, holding it by his chest. We were next to a vet with a parking lot so I dipped in there with my dog while watching him walk by, and he was watching me. No pointing that I saw but I still felt threatened and now I feel scared to go that way or even walk in my neighborhood as I don’t know who he is or where he lives. He could’ve been homeless as both times he was carrying the same plastic grocery bag. Either way, I don’t know what my options are here or if I should be doing anything?

Problem is, my dad was an addict who eventually turned his back on everyone and lost everything he had; He had debts to many, many banks, and became homeless years ago. He abused me as a kid and siphoned off thousands of dollars from my brother and me until we severed contact with him. Now I am finding out that even a basic cremation costs around $1000. It seems he's draining my resources one last time from beyond the grave.

Do I have a legal obligation to pay for the disposal of his remains? Or can I tell the coroner that I want nothing to do with it? I do believe I am the only contact they have for him, but nobody else in the family has even reached out to help me handle the logistics of this, let alone the cost, so I reckon if I don't take care of this, nobody will.",legaladvice,t3_dl3cuj

"[CO] Girlfriend's car was T-Boned by driver who ran red light. Called his insurance and they said he wasn't covered at the time of the accident. On 10-15-19 at around 11AM MST, my girlfriend was t-boned in the driver side door by a vehicle that ran a red light. Luckily no one was seriously injured. Cops arrived on the scene shortly after. She drives a 2012 Ford Escape which was totaled as was the other driver's car. The person at fault also clipped the front end of a Chevy Truck before striking her Ford Escape, however those damages are minor. 

They all wrote down their witness statements, exchanged contact information and insurance information. The police officer wrote him a ticket for running the red light and for striking two vehicles. Due to the value of my girlfriend's car, she only has liability insurance. She went to speak with the insurance of the gentleman at fault and she was told that his insurance was lapsed at the time of the accident. They told her his insurance lapsed on 10-13-19. However no ticket was issued for driving without insurance. The at fault driver's insurance said that they received payment for insurance at 11:00 AM MST. The time listed on the accident report is 10:58 AM MST. The at fault driver told my girlfriend over the phone today that he had renewed the insurance earlier that morning before leaving his house. It's starting to look like he didn't renew his auto insurance until after the accident had occurred. 

My girlfriend's car was totaled. She was actually on her way to a job interview as she just recently moved to the state. She is also still trying to set up health insurance since moving. Hopefully the at fault driver is telling the truth, that he did pay for his insurance earlier in the day before leaving. But if not, what are some options available?

From what I have gathered, it seems like she would have to sue. She doesn't have the funds right now to be paying lawyer fees. If she sued him and won, would he be responsible for her legal fees? How common is it for lawyers to work on contingency when the payout wouldn't be very substantial ($6K Bluebook Car Value, maybe $1K-$2K medical fees and charges, some amount for lost time, damages, pain and suffering)? Since it seems like the officer who wrote the ticket for running the red light is unaware he was uninsured at the time, should we notify the county prosecutor's office to see if charges could be brought for driving without insurance. I was told by a friend that as part of the conviction, he would have to pay restitution for the damage done to the car.

Hope your day is going better than mine. So this just transpired about an hour ago. I was exiting a business while riding my nickle board (similar to a skateboard, but smaller) and I began to put my wallet and phone back into my fanny pack, then all of a sudden, I tripped over a little bump in the concrete. This then caused me to fly forward while simultaneously kicking my nickle boards backwards straight to the business behind, cracking the main window pane of their business. The dimension of this was easily 10'+x10'+. It all happened so fast, all I could do was stand in there in shock with my stuck looking like :-0... An employee comes out and says, ""You broke it!... I'll get the manager."" Two managers, the employee, and myself look at the glass and it definitely has to be replace. The nickle board hit it pretty hard and caused about a 2' crack. So, they took a photo of my ID and I gave them my cell number. So what happens now? I'm guessing the company will get the window pane replaced and then bill me for it?

"[NY] Being made to repay employer for counterfeit bills. **EDIT** I called the NYS department of labor and they let me know that it's not legal for us to have to pay the employer back with our paycheck or with cash and the employer has no legal right to ask that of us or require we pay it back in any way. I am planning on letting my coworker know, he didn't have the $50 on him at the time to pay the owner back so hopefully I can catch him before he pays the owner back and let him know he absolutely does not have to do that and it's not legal for the employer to ask us to.

I work at an independently owned gas station. 

We’ve had issues in the past of people giving us counterfeit bills, and we have these little machines we are told to use to check every large bill (twenties, fifties, hundreds) which are at the end of the counter and frankly a pain in the ass to have to use every time we get a twenty or higher. It’s a minimum wage job so most of the people working there just do a visual check of large bills or only check hundreds. 


My coworker accepted a $50 counterfeit bill yesterday and when the owner came in and confronted him about it he told the employee that he owed him a $50 bill. The employee was apologetic and said he can take it out of his pay but the owner said “no, you’re gonna give me a fifty.” I already found the situation to seem a little illegal but the owner saying he wanted the money in cash and not deducted from employee pay made me raise my eyebrows even more. 


I’ve been doing my own research now that I’m home from work but I can only really find info about other states that tends to be “it’s illegal to make you pay for it, but they can fire you if you don’t.” 


I was just wondering what the laws were about this in New York state.

"Ex threatening to lawyer up over supposed invasion of privacy This takes place in the central Illinois area.

My ex and I broke up around six months ago. At the time of the break up, she had been using a phone that was on my contract (plan as well as lease). Because she had lost her job several months before, this was a bill that I had been paying for her despite her originally agreeing to pay for it. After she moved out, I told her I would either need the phone back or some kind of payment for her portion of the bill. Her response was only obscenities, so I had the phone turned off and arranged with her mother (whom she had moved back in with) for me to come pick up the device. After I arrived at the home, I waited outside for several hours and made conversation with her mother, who told me that she was in the process of trying to back up the photos on the phone to another device. Eventually, my ex gave up on this as a result of how long it had taken thus forth, and she walked outside, shoving the phone at me and announcing she had instead reset the device. I verified this myself, went home, and went about my business. 

Several months later, we are no longer in contact, and I even have her blocked on social media because our few interactions have been so full of bitterness and unpleasantries over our messy break up.

Today, she messaged me from a new Facebook account, asking me to explain why her Facebook email and password had been changed. I said I didn't know, and she sent me screenshots of a login notification, one of which was from a Samsung Galaxy S9 (via her email), saying that her account had been logged in from my town, as well as listing the IP address of the devices. She said that she would be getting a lawyer for invasion of privacy, because she was tired of her things being accessed from her old phone that I currently have. I reminded her that she personally wiped the phone, she responded by saying that since all of the evidence lead back to me, she would see to it that it was dealt with. And then blocked me. Before doing this she also stated that the IP points to my address but, based on my attempts of using various websites to try to locate the IP, this does not appear to be the case. 

My questions are; 
Does she actually have a case against me from this evidence alone, or is this most likely a bluff to try to elicit a reaction?

My understanding of the location data available from an IP address is that it's only an approximation. Could this location data possibly help prove my innocence, or is it irrelevant because of it's lack of accuracy? 

Is it possible/likely that my phone or computer could be seized as evidence to this case? I rely on my computer for school, and this would make completing my classwork pretty much impossible since I'm in online classes. I will also be occasionally on call for my department at work, so not having access to my phone could be detrimental to my ability to perform my job duties.

And lastly, I work in the health industry. While I'm not someone that works with patients regularly, I occasionally have to deal with patient information as a result of my job duties.

"Does anyone know laws regarding new apartment management changing utility billing policies? So Bf and I are currently renting an apt in Irving TX. We signed a year lease starting in January. Back in July, a new management company bought out our complex. I'm not even going to get into all the ways they have so far dropped the ball but it ranges from broken mailboxes that they refuse to fix, (I have to go to the damn post office if I want my mail) A/C unit that they have admitted is too small to cool our apt (causing massive electric bills) etc.  

But my problem today is the water bill. On our copy of the original lease, the management gave us a 'water estimate' addendum that we signed. Basically it states that the water bill is split between all tenants based on size of apartment as well as number of occupants. It also mentions that the numbers quoted may change based on the water utility provider itself or any additional fees the provider may charge. The average bill shown is about $80 dollars and the highest they show says $104. Our bill has been around $80-90 which is high compared to some complexes but not the end of the world. 

Ever since this new company took over, our water bill has ranged from $140-$160 per month the last 3 months.
The first bill was a combination of two months so I thought, okay fine. The next two were even more alone than the previous two months combined. So when I got the bill today for $147 I lost it and called the office.  Apparently the old management was paying 60% of our bill and we were paying 40%. New management has decided they will now only pay 10% and we will pay 90%. The lady also mentioned that there are some big 'leaks' around the building that they haven't gotten around to fixing and that it should go down a little bit soon when they finally fix them. Like this was a great consolation. 


The lease also states that any leaks around the premises should be fixed within 7 days. I'm irate now. I basically move every year to a new apt complex for a change of scenery and have never in my 13 years of renting seen anything so outrageous.

"[CA] Living in a rented house infested with roaches. Any and all advice is welcomed. 
I live in the US in California to be more specific. Sorry if this post is a bit all over, I will try to explain the situation as best as I can.

It’s pretty much as the title states. I live with both my parents and my two younger siblings, we live in a rented house.
It’s sort of a connecting house, the building itself is directly connected with our neighbor to the right but neither of us have access to each other’s home if that makes sense. Our front door is the only way in to our side and their front door is the only way in to theirs, but yeah it’s pretty much one big building.

Anyways, we’ve been living here for maybe the past 10+ years and since day 1 we have had a bad roach infestation. They are literally everywhere but it has always been worse in the kitchen.

Before we moved in the house the roach problem was really bad, but my dad has fixed up the place a lot, with the landlords permission of course. It’s really getting annoying though, so I’m looking for a bit of advice on what to do.

At first my dad didn’t mind it that much because rent is high in most places around here, and the landlord used to charge him only about 600$ a month. However around the end of last year the landlord told him the rent would be increased the following year so he’s been paying about 1000$ a month since then. Now since he’s paying a bit more, my dad would like the landlord to try to be more reasonable about the roach problem the house has.

The real problem is that my dad has brought up the issue to the landlord in the recent past, but instead of fumigating or something the landlord just gave my dad a cheaper version of the Raid roach killing spray. We don’t even use that stuff, we buy actual Raid roach killing spray because it’s the only thing that can even help -_-

And over the past few years we have also come to realize the house may have a possible termite problem. We see them more around late summer/fall I think. He hasn’t mentioned the termite thing to the landlord as they don’t actually come here very often, except on the rare occasion to complain to my dad about things, but he did want to mention it to them next time they come by in person.

My question is, who is responsible for dealing with fumigation? Would that fall on my dads shoulders? Because like I said before, I’m pretty sure if we had the house fumigated our connecting neighbors would have to do it too because the house is literally one big house so We know they also have a roach and bug problem.

"Girlfriend having problems with landlord from 2.5 years ago (North Carolina) Hey legal advice

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to help my girlfriend out, looks like a landlord from a few years back is giving her some issues.

I'm still a bit fuzzy on the details, currently at work and my girlfriend just called me freaking out. I'll update tonight when I have more information.

&amp;#x200B;

Back when my girlfriend was in college she lived in an apartment near campus, she moved out of the apartment about 2.5 years ago. She subleased the apartment to someone else for the last 3 months of the lease. Apparently about a year ago (1.5 years since she moved out and over a year since the lease ended) she was sent a letter from the apartment saying she owed them money for damages. She thought it was kind of weird given she hadn't lived there in over a year so she called the complex and according to her they said it was a mistake and they would take care of it. Today she got a call from a collections agency telling her she owes them money for unspecified damages to the apartment complex. When she asked the collections company for details they couldn't give them to her and said they would get back to her. When talking to my girlfriend I found out she doesn't know what happened to her security deposit and assumed it was just transferred over to the subleaser. I'm wondering where that went and if it was applied to the unspecified damages or not. My understanding is North Carolina requires landlords to itemize any damages and give the balance of the security deposit back to the tenant no later than 30 days after termination of the tenancy. The way it stands currently it looks like the apartment didn't return her security deposit and they didn't provide any itemized list of damages until over a year after the end of her tenancy. Not really sure how to approach this situation. Given no list of damages was provided in the initial 30 days does she still have to pay for anything?",legaladvice,t3_dl5uab

"Sold my vehicle to someone, never signed over the title, he got rid of the vehicle and I'm still being charged vehicle taxes. I'm in the state of Kentucky.

To explain further, the vehicle was completely out of commission. This relative was keeping the vehicle in his garage as I didn't have a place for it. He wanted to buy it from me, so we agreed on a payment plan. Once it was paid off, I would sign over the title. Yes, I realize this was ignorant. Eventually it was paid off but the title transfer never happened. We had a falling out (unrelated) and my relative disposed of the vehicle. I don't know if he sold it, junked it, or what.

The incident happened at about 2:30 in the afternoon and I worked until 5:00 in the evening. I was not offered to go to a clinic and there was not a report that was written up. I went to an urgent care that night because I was pretty messed up. They took care of me and told me to contact the employer for worker’s compensation stuff. I contacted them immediately and they wanted pictures and a written statement as well as the paperwork I received from the urgent care clinic.

"Dog passes away roughly 48 hours after being fixed. No one can give me a stright answer as to what happend and everyone seems to be trying to down playing it. Hi,

Excuse my typing as this is on mobile and I'm still pretty upset about everything.

I'll start at the beginning.

About 2 years ago my dog swallowed something plastic and had to have surgery to remove it from her intestines. After this surgery she was fine and everything was smooth sailing.

Fast forward to last week.

I had an appointment to have my dog spayed on Wednesday morning at a local animal hospital/shelter. I was told not to let my dog: 4 y/o chihuahua terrier eat last 7pm on Tuesday and I followed this request.

Wednesday morning comes and I drop her off at the shelter. It is very vital to the story that I mention prior to taking her to the appointment that morning she was as energetic and happy and eating normally as she has ever been.

The doctors call me Wednesday afternoon to let me know that the spay went smoothly but it was a complicated procedure due to her previous surgery. They did not mention why but mentioned regardless it went swimmingly.

I pick her up and take her home and was told she could eat again in 5 hours when the Medication wore off. She did not that night and was uninterested in all of the food I gave her.

Thursday comes and goes and she is still not eating and I'm beginning to become nervous but I figured I'd give it an extra day.

Friday comes and she is still fighting me on trying to feed her anything. I figured I'd put a call into the shelter that conducted the surgery and I left a voice mail as I expect they were not open yet.

I call my vet and all they tell me is to go back to the surgeon because they would not provide support for a surgery they did not conduct? Wierd.. but I let it slide with hope the shelter would get back to me.

Around 3pm on Friday the shelter gets back to me and let's me know their doctors are all gone for the day but if she still isn't eating to take her to my regular vet. Called the regular vet again which referred me to a 24 hour emergency room for animals in my area.

I now am fighting my dog to try and eat anything and I now notice her wound from the surgery looks infected. A few moments later she begins to urinate blood. At this moment I packed her up and rushed her to the recommended emergency room.

The doctors at the emergency room originally said she was just malnourished and dehydrated from that of wanting to eat and drink. They said they wanted to monitor her over night and I could come see her in the morning.

Around 11pm I get another call that they think she has an infection due to her low white blood cell count and that she was struggling to fight the infection but they might have to preform an ultrasound to really find out and they would keep me posted with how shes doing.

Around 3am I get a call that she does indeed have an internal infection and was septic and she needs immediate surgery to have it corrected and it was a 50/50 chance of success. They estimated 7,000 for the surgery and wanted 50% down to begin the procedure. I immediately drove to the ER again and began talking to the doctors. After fighting to come up with the money for the surgery they tell me my only option is to now put her down to prevent her suffering. As hard as we tried this is the only option they really gave us as it was now roughly 6am Saturday and we still didnt have the 3500 down and 3500 after the surgery.

After pleading with the ER they would not give us a reason as to where this infection came from and why. They would not tell us if they thought it was related to the spay. They basically said it could of been ""anything""

This morning I receive a follow up call from the shelter that preformed the spay and I explain the entire story.

They get the medical records from the ER and return my call.

They basically then told me it could of been their fault or it could of just as likely been an infection that existed prior to the surgery and I know that could not be the case due to how she was pre surgery. They basically said they have no idea what happend.

They didnt offer a refund for the surgery or take any responsibility. They instead told me they would waive the adoption fee for another dog and told me I could come pick one out...

I guess I'm looking for advice on where to go from here... something happens to my dog that someone is not telling me and they both seem to be giving me the run arond.

My family currently rents a house and lives with other family. My family has reason to believe that a Nosy Family Member is both intercepting mail and reading it.

Furthermore, Nosy Family Member has a history of petty behavior like this, including ripping up tax refunds (there was evidence of that). The mail we do get is junk mail and advertisements, which is very suspicious and is in line with Nosy Family Member's passive aggressive behavior. (We live in the same house but are basically estranged.) We have not received important letters including wedding invitations, checks, and doctor referrals.

"Canada - Lawyer botches case, and is now suing for costs My wife of 20 years, tried to sue her ex employer after receiving a death threat, and how they mishandled it, the lawyer botched the case, and is now taking her to court for costs.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I don't know what to do for her and I'm desperate. This all takes place in Ontario Canada. I suppose the best place to start is with the initial case.

&amp;#x200B;

Several years ago, my wife worked in the telecom industry for a major player, and had a customer threatening her life several times. The employer responded by trying to force her to speak to this person, rather than protect her. She began to suffer serious panic attacks and PTSD to the point she couldn't leave the house. She applied for, and was awarded WSIB to cover her off time and was sent to one of their Psychiatrists. At that time, I decided that there was no way she was ever going back, and took some of my savings and built a small business. For over a year, there was no way she would ever even consider going into the business, but little by little, I convinced her to spend time there. This took about 1.5 years. Every action she took at the shop, she reported to her WSIB psychiatrist who encouraged us to keep going as 'exposure therapy'. FF another six months, and she talks to her first customer in my shop. She threw up after a 2 minute conversation, but it was a huge step which the Psychiatrist saw as moving back to normal. This went on and got better and better until one day, we find out that her old employer had sent Private investigators to spy on her. Of course it sent her into another spiral. Her biggest fear was being watched, and here was confirmation it was true.

&amp;#x200B;

We battled this for a while, and all the while her lawyer kept assuring her that they had no case. She even allowed us to work up costs, making small payments assuring us that it would all work out fine. Honestly, I think we trusted her too much because there were A LOT of things she omitted from evidence. Damning things like lies on the surveillance report, proof she wasn't working, evidence in emails from her employer threatening her job if she didn't talk to this person etc. But, I accepted her assurances that we couldn't just submit those things...that there was a process. Finally, it turned out that the Arbitrator didn't believe the WSIB Psychiatrist, and accused her of lying on my wife's behalf, and we lost the case. We were able to appeal, of course so I assumed that was the next step. That's when we received a letter, out of the blue from our lawyer, that she was removing herself from the case and that our arrears of $43,000 was due. Of course, because she lost, her ex employer was coming after her for disability benefits paid in the amount of $5000.

&amp;#x200B;

This broke my wife. She went into exile which, I'm sad to say, all but destroyed our relationship. This time, I wasn't getting her out again, and she no longer trusted my judgment telling her we needed to fight. There was no way she could handle going through the appeal and...well...she ran.

&amp;#x200B;

FF to a few months ago and we've since reconciled, with me helping her every step of the way. I started making payments, to the lawyer, trying to get this huge number brought down. She has no income, still has trouble talking to people, but is still trying. I did sit with her, on several occasions, and wrote emails, back and forth with the lawyer where they had payment agreements, and the lawyer NEVER mentioned anything. Today, we receive a thick binder of motions, and assessments made against her that she never knew about. Now, there is a motion, due on the 24th, to force her to go to court stating that ""no payments were made"" but we have several on record. Also, there are affidavits from the couriers saying they served her with these past forms, but I guarantee you, there is absolutely no record of this because, while we were separated, I was the one who sent them away.

&amp;#x200B;

So now, they want to force her to go to court, and I KNOW there's no way she can do it. NONE. But I need to do something. The lawyer screwed us over, then lied and is coming after her, and there doesn't seem to be anything I can do to help. I've called the lawyer and offered to continue making the payments, but I doubt she'll call back, now that it's going to court, and there is no way I can scrounge $43000 plus another $5000 to pay these people back. This is going to end her, and break us both, because if she goes down, I go down. 20 years together, me building the business, every step forward we've made, torn down by this inept and heartless person...correction...people. I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've written a story outlining the original case with her employer, attempting in my weak way, to make it interesting because it's so damn long. I've sent it out to thousands of people, including media, politicians, etc, but one thing you have to understand is this company OWNS the media where I live. Like literally, their name is plastered across every station. One thing that our lawyer told us that stuck with me was, ""you can't sue these people"". He didn't mean just because they're a powerful giant, but because they have ties to the Canadian govt, and are above lawsuits in some aspects. Anyway, it's very long, but I've tried to make it worth it. It's too long to post here, so I've posted it on textuploader if you're interested.

"Company adjusting PTO balance after a raise...is that legal? So I work for a government contractor that pays us hourly and we accrue PTO based on hours worked. This is then paid out at our hourly rate during payroll when we charge for sick or vacation time.

I learned that one of their policies is to dilute your PTO when you get a raise so that the value of your PTO stays the same even though your hourly rate increased. They basically will decrease the balance of your PTO by the same percentage as your raise so that if you have been saving your PTO, the value of the PTO that you accrued at the lower rate doesn't get paid out at the higher rate. 

This makes some sense but it does seem odd to me that an employer would just manipulate PTO balances and I'm wondering if this is legal? If you guys have any references I can bring to my boss please let me know. I can't seem to find anything regarding this on Google so.

"I think my old job is trying to avoid paying me So, I used to work at a restaurant and quit. I came back because my best friend wanted me to, I started working there again in September(don't have exact date) and my last shift was Oct. 2. I didn't get my first paycheck because they still had my old bank on file and I had closed that and opened a new one. Okay, no big deal.

Sept 23 I missed my first paycheck because of this.

Sept 24, the week I missed my first paycheck, I sent them a direct deposit change form on email. I wasn't aware I had to sign it so I come in the next day and sign it. I hung out for a while because my friend was working and left AFTER closing. Not once was I told I had anything else to sign. Fast forward to the next payday, October 7, I still haven't gotten paid. I talk to another manager and she says our head manager says I still have more forms to sign. I came in October 12 to sign those and thought that was the end of it.

I sent them this email October 16:

Hello,

I began working for XXX again last September. I unfortunately had to leave for personal reasons but have not received two paychecks I should have- one on September 23, with a gross earning of $99.40(net wage of 91.80), and one on the seventh of October, with a gross earning of $134.70(net wage $124.40). I sent an email for my direct deposit change September 24, came in the next day to sign that, then was informed at a later date there was more I needed to sign and came to do so on the 12 of October.  I have yet to receive my two missed paychecks and was wondering when I would be receiving those.

Thanks,

brokencupcakeblvd""

&amp;#x200B;

(I didn't address it in the email but there was another paycheck after where I would have been paid $91.80, so my total wages from working there would be $308. I didn't address it in the email because they pay on Monday every two weeks, so that one I wouldn't have received anyway.)

I received this response 2 hours later:

""XXX(the head manager) has emailed payroll and is awaiting a response""

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I got a deposit of $264.72, which... doesn't make sense. I don't see how it added up so I log into the website that shows our pay stubs.... and my pay stubs from working there are missing. It stills shows the last pay stub that's genuinely mine (which says I'll be getting paid on the 23, but we've always gotten paid on Mondays), and weird pay stub with the pay date the 21st( today), saying I earned $303.70 (net total $264.72). But that pay stub is from after I stopped working, and the two pay stubs from when I actually worked are just... gone. Dissapeared from the website.

I'm not really sure where to go from here, or what I'm supposed to do?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I was supposed to earn $308. If I get paid on the 23, I'll have been overpaid $48.52, if they don't pay on the 23 I'll have been underpaid $35.28

"Privacy breach investigation meeting I tried posting here last week but was so shambled it was removed. I’ve tried to calm my nerves and gather myself a bit to post hoping for some advice. 

I work in Canada as a medical office assistant. Wednesday I was emailed that I have a meeting with HR for a ‘patient confidentiality complaint’. They are providing me a union representative, but will not give him or I more information on the matter at hand. 

While I know I have never breached confidentiality, I do have people from my past life who have threatened to ruin my career. While that was nearly a year ago, I won’t be surprised if they were just biding their time. 

My questions are:
Are they not required to tell my representative what the meeting pertains to, more detailed than ‘privacy breach’? How can he properly represent me without any prior knowledge?

Obviously I plan to tell the truth, but if for some reason they decide I’ve done something I ‘shouldn’t’ have, Will I be terminated?

I’ve been running my mind in circles since receiving the email on Wednesday. I’m wracking my brain for what this could be about. While I’d like to hope it’s something small and insignificant, they’ve decided it’s serious enough to call in executives in HR for this meeting, and I’m pretty scared.

So, my parents recently retired and planned to sell their assets in order to start traveling around. On July 11th, the house was sold. A week prior, they had sold the car. A guy approached them from an online posting about the vehicle to which they ended up selling the car to him. This was a full cash transaction. The funny thing is, this guy claimed that he was worried he would get pulled over without a tag on the back of the vehicle. In lieu of this he asked if he could keep the tag on and drive to the DMV to get all the remaining information switched over to him. In the end, my parents agreed to this, however there was never any follow up from this man. My parents did not accompany him to the DMV. In the end I don't believe that any information regarding this vehicle was transferred to this guy is driving the car around with our tag. The title remains in my parents name.

"Lives Threatened (ND (USA))  

Hello LA,

Sorry in advance for the format as I am a little out of sorts.

My  wife and I do foster care and have recently been informed that a  biological father has threatened to kill my wife, the county case  manager, and myself. This was reported to us through the case manager.  She was told by his Addiction counselor. We have made reports to the  local PD but unfortunately lack firsthand information, as does the case  manager, to obtain a protection order or even to file a terrorizing  charge. The counselor and their facility legal team have clammed up  claiming HIPPA and are no longer working with us. This father has two  open felony cases that he is currently on bail for, one aggravated  assault and one drug possession. We are currently in fear for our lives  and the lives of those in our care. We don't know what he will/wont do  but it's wrecking havoc on our psyche.

My questions. 1) What legal options are there to protect my family that we can pursue without the testimony of his counselor?

2)  How can I, or his case manager, or his PO/ the PD get around HIPPA to  force cooperation of his counselor and obtain the information PD would  need for a revocation of parole or a restraining order/protection order?

"Is it time to file a police report? Parking ticket on a ghost car Some legal questions at the bottom of this strange story if you want to skip the actual story....

My Mom got a parking ticket notification in the mail on Friday for a town she has never been to. We actually had to look the town up and it is about an hour-and-a-half drive away and not in the realm of possibility that we were there and I just didn't remember. I was also going to post this story to legaladvice a few days ago when she first got the ticket, but after some advice from my Uncle to contact the Clerk of Courts, I wanted to wait until she talked with them before posting for some legal advice.

So, here it goes:

On 10/18, my Mom got a parking ticket for a town over an hour away. It told her to pay the ticket or setup a court date or her license would be suspended. The really odd thing about this notification was the date on the ticket, it was in May of 2017.

After checking our bank accounts, we were sure we didn't go there during the dates of the ticket because neither of us had any purchases from outside our locale on our bank statements and we both make heavy use of bank cards.

If I had borrowed her vehicle and gone down there, I would've purchased something and if we were both in the area, we would've been shopping in the area, but there was nothing.

So today she called the Clerk of Courts and is hoping that they don't just tell her to fuck off and pay the ticket.

She said the lady she spoke to was really nice and she found out that the ticket was issued in 2017 to her 2000 Silver Chevy Cavalier. The problem with that? She traded the 2000 Silver Chevy Cavalier into a dealer in 2015.

The Clerk of Courts told her she would take care of the ticket and my Mom should call the DMV and discuss it with them further. Basically, she needed to ensure that she wouldn't be receiving any tickets from other municipalities based on a vehicle she hasn't owned in 4 years.

So this afternoon, my Mom gives the DMV a ring and then things get even weirder.

After giving the DMV the VIN, they tell her that according to their records, the vehicle was junked around the time she traded it in... She told me the guy at the DMV also said the VIN in their system seemed ""hinkey"" but she didn't press further on what he meant.

**TLDR:** 

My Mom got a parking ticket two years ago for a vehicle that was supposedly junked by a dealer 4 years ago that she traded into a dealer.

**Legal Questions:**

1-Should she contact the police for that town and file a report?

It seems as if someone is using a vehicle that should've been junked and got the parking ticket. What is the likely hood of a cop fat fingering something like the VIN when writing a ticket and not noticing that the rest of the information (plates, make, model, color) don't match?

2-Are there any situations where my mom could be legally liable for what someone is doing with this vehicle?

A bunch of the people we talked to say not to fight it but can't give me a specific example of why (most of them haven't had to go to court for a speeding ticket).

"Plaintiff came to my house asking for money I was previously evicted from my apartment early 2019. There has since been a hearing scheduled September 29th for a payment plan, but I missed the notice in my email which I rarely check and totally blew the hearing by accident. I got a email a couple days ago saying there would be a warrant for my arrest as I failed to attend the hearing. I submitted a motion to vacate as per what the clerk told me to do when I explained my situation so I could not get arrested and properly situate this and maybe set up a payment plan.

Tonight, the plaintiff came to my house and told me he objected all the motions and said I would have a warrant for my arrest if I don’t pay up, essentially trying to scare me. I gave him a piece of my mind because he was obviously being sleazy and trying to manipulate me into giving him all the money I can (I owe him $4,000) but I am unemployed and don’t have a dollar to my name. He was just very rude and disrespectful to me and I told him I’d like to set up a payment arrangement which he says he will refuse. Essentially he just wants to see me get arressted.

"Worst automotive fraud I’ve dealt with(TX, USA) So this started out as a typical vehicle purchase from a private party, and has spiraled into a disaster that constantly consumes me with anxiety. 

I noticed a truck for sale in my hometown of San Antonio for a fairly reasonable price. Went to contact the seller(Adam) and found out that he is allegedly a US serviceman who was in desperation to get rid of his truck before his impending deployment the same week. Title status was claimed as clean in the ad. 
When I showed up he(A) informed me that the title had been shipped along with other important documents (birth certificates, medical records, etc.) and (A) swore he would send it as soon as he arrived in Okinawa and unpacked; which I didn’t see as unreasonable considering I know this fast paced move isn’t uncommon for active duty service members. 

I was still cautious however and came up with the agreement that I would withhold a portion of the agreed upon sale price until I had the title in my hand. This was written into the bill of sale and signed by both parties. (I have his state issued license on hand as well with all his personal information)

Fast forward a week or two after his alleged move, we’ve messaged back and forth discussing shipping of the title (which I end up paying $70 for). He messages me saying that his “financial advisor yadda yadda yadda..” has suggested he request some of the remaining payment for “a bit of security on his end”. I’m unfortunately a very trusting person and forwarded him a portion of the remaining balance later that day, still no proof he’s even shipped the title.

I’ve researched the history of the truck tirelessly, and come to find out, through countless vin checks and DMV inquiries; not only is the title not in his name, but it has a lien on it and is in possession of a very cutthroat-high-interest financial group. He got the vehicle from a sketchy dealer in town and they even have him with the truck in one of their little typical (happy customer) promotional pictures on their Facebook. Since the picture was taken sometime last year he has sold off the nice tires and put awful ones on, sold the tailgate, and gotten a decent sized dent where the bed meets the cab.

I have gotten in contact with the dealer this morning, letting them know that I want to do the right thing and that I have one of their vehicles in my possession. Obviously I assume the financial company will repossess the truck when I get in contact with them considering they hold the title, and I’ll be out THOUSANDS on this deal. Quite a bit for myself being a struggling college student who bought the truck to start up a small business.

I have no idea what recourse I can take if any, besides the local police dept. mentioning small claims court when I explained the issue. Oh and by the way I have my doubts Adam’s really in active service considering he only messages during US daytime and an ex close friend of his I contacted through Facebook, is owed money by (A); as well as being under the assumption he moved to Chicago to join the navy.

"Concerns about Ownership clause in new contract What's up ya'll?

I am based in Southern California and recently started doing sales with a new client and am in the process of working out our agreement. I will be an Independent Contractor and the owner of the Company sent over an agreement to me last week.  

There's a particular clause that I take issue with and would love to get some insight on.

It regards ownership of materials created during the year-long engagement. 

The clause, which I've posted below, states that the Company owns any ""materials prepared by Finder in the performance of services under this Agreement including materials subject to copyright protection, such materials have been specially commisioned by the Company...Finder hereby irreovcably and exclusively assigns to the Company and its successors all right, title and interest in and to such materials.""

I'm okay with the Company owning materials that are expressly created for them but I'm worried about my personal content. I have a blog and other content outlets that I'm growing and working on including, but not limited to, video and audio content as well as digital learning platforms. My concern is that this clause could grant them ownership of any, or all, of that content and material. 

Am I reading that incorrectly or is there something I should add or change to ensure that can't happen?

I'm doing sales work for them and I worry they might somehow be able to argue that my personal content - in a somewhat related field - is a way to generate potential leads or attention for this company.

Thoughts? 

I appreciate your help.

"Is it possible to sue a gas company for negligence that caused severe damage to my apartment building and unit? My apartment building is directly behind a gas station. There’s probably about two feet or less behind the back of our building and the back of the gas station. On October 16th around midnight there was a gas truck refueling the gas stations reservoir and somehow gas vapor got into my buildings ventilation and subsequently caused my units AC and a few others to essentially explode and also causing a fire to start from inside the walls of the building.

The firefighters on the scene and arson specialists inspected everything and asked all of us questions and ruled it as the vault of the gas station. A lot of our units had a strong gasoline smell in them as well as smoke. My unit was the one with the worst damage. Red Cross even came out the next day to help provide us assistance and the gas company’s insurance came out as well to assess the damages and I guess offer to pay for things in our apartments that were damaged? I’m not sure on that part because it was the day after the accident and I was out of it when I spoke to her.

What I’m wondering is, would it be possible to sue this gas company for negligence? There’s another gas station across our street that I go to and the owner there said that it happened probably because every 3 months he gets everything checked and the station behind us wasn’t doing that. I asked him if this accident could happen again and he shrugged. He said he was surprised it wasn’t more serious. 

If I can’t sue the company could I possibly get my deposit back from the apartment and move out because I don’t feel safe moving back into that unit when repairs are done. My anxiety is so bad right now, even hearing the AC in the temporary apartment we’re staying in turn on makes me jump. I can’t even go to the grocery store now when it’s busy because it puts me into a panic attack and I can’t sleep at night because all I can think of is what’s going to happen when we move back in.

"What can I do about this creepy neighbor in my apartment complex? ARIZONA

I have this neighbor (single, old man) who lives on the floor below me. He watches me and my boyfriend all the time.

For example, he learned the sound of my car beep. His bedroom window overlooks the parking lot, and when I come home, park my car, and lock it (you know, the beep sound). He immediately pokes his head through the blinds and just STARES at me as I’m walking toward my apartment. And it doesn’t stop there. I have to walk past his apartment in order to get to my apartment. And he watches me through his front window too. 

I often stare back to let him know I see him, but it got uncomfortable for me so I stopped doing it. He knows that I know he does this, so he tries to be sneaky about it now. 

Whenever I get home and walk past his apartment, he ever so slightly moves the blinds so he can just peep his eye out. But I can see the blinds moving. So I know he’s there watching me. 

One time I went to go get something from my car, and he was out on a walk. He saw me, and stopped right in front of my car, just WATCHING me. I was afraid to go past him, so I waited for what seemed like forever, until he finally gave up and left. 

I thought about reporting him to the front office but the only person who works there is a bitter old woman who hates me and has never been helpful during other situations.

"Beggar keeps following cars and people in shopping plaza (ohio) I'm on mobile so there might be a few things wrong. Also kinda long...

I've been going to this shopping plaza for a year or so because it has a laundromat, and is a couple blocks from my bf's house. I only get a day off a week, so I only go for convenience sake. Its on the east side of Dayton, so there are some seedy people as expected. 

But for the last month, this petite woman who's obviously addicted to something has started making rounds here. She has personally come up to me 3 times already asking for change inside the laundromat, then asks all the other people before going back out to knock on car windows. 

From watching her, I have noticed she makes a few rounds during the time where everyone comes in to get things before the kids get off the bus, disappears for 30 minutes to a hour, then comes back when everyone is out getting things with their kids with one of 3 things; a new outfit, a drink from a restaurant, or a pack of cigarettes. What strikes me is that she has a somewhat new smartphone and nice glasses.

Today, she has made some extra effort into following cars and people, despite it pouring rain. She came into the laundromat I was in 2ish times, then went through the parking lot a lot thoroughly, even approaching people pulling in and out before they have even parked. 

I am starting to get annoyed by this, and she has occasionally been a hazard to people driving. But since she isn't doing more than these things, idk if I should report her, if this can even BE reported. I tried looking it up, but it hasn't been much help to me.",legaladvice,t3_dl7r2k

A couple of days ago she calls me basically crying saying this same guy walked up behind her after her shift sitting down and sucked her neck. To the point of leaving a hickie. She says she turned around and said to not touch her anymore.

"My grandmother passed away, now her land is causing problems. Based in Trinidad and Tobago 🇹🇹 

I just want to post this here cause this is stressing me out
Let me just say
I am a granddaughter of my grandma so I know that this isn’t really affecting me, but it is affecting my mother, her three sisters and her brother.
Let’s set the scene
My grandma died before she could consult with a lawyer to get her will set out, so as a backup she made an agreement where her children would gain rights to her house. Only her son was living in the house at the time so she decided to set the plan as the son would gain majority of the house (a two story house) getting the top half of the house and the bottom would be split between the children, the son gets 50% (the top half) and his share from the bottom half, 10%. So in all the son would get 60% of the total house while the five other daughters get 10%. This was done so that, even though the sone was to be named as the ‘owner’ for him to sell the house, rent it or destroy it he would need to get the permission of all the other sisters to do whatever he wanted to do. 
That was decided and the daughters of the person who died agreed to write a legal document stating basically what I said above even though I never got the chance to read the entire document.
Now on the day that everything was set (the day that I posted this) all of the family came down and some others who weren’t part of the family but who came to be a ‘witness’ (or something like that) and when he was finally shown the document all hell broke lose.
He kept saying that he didn’t want to sign it and that he would rip up the document and that he wanted either all of the house, as in full ownership, or nothing.
The lawyer who was working with us is my cousin but nothing was entitled to her and she wasn’t trying to get anything out of it. 

Just so that you know the country this takes place in is Trinidad and Tobago 🇹🇹 so I don’t know how the laws differ

I know nothing about the laws and anything remotely close to being a lawyer but I need help in this cause he would most likely take his family to court to get the entire land and house as his own.

"My employer is denying workers sick pay and overtime pay through deceit I work for a pizza joint in Arizona while I finish out my last few months of school. I’ve been here for about 7 months now and had never taken a day off until just recently. When I came back the next day and asked for sick pay to be applied to the day I missed I was told “oh we don’t do that here”. A little shocked and feeling like I could potentially be misinformed I left it at that and went to do research on the matter. It did indeed turn out that I was fully in my rights to ask for sick pay and be granted it so I presented the info to my boss and without even getting all the way through he said “okay, I’ll talk to my accounting guy and get it to you next pay period”.  This seemed very suspicious to me so I talked to some of the other employees about their experiences with asking or receiving benefits like overtime and sick pay. I found out that not only has no one else received sick pay but none of them have ever been paid overtime either. There are 2 employees in particular that work roughly 50 hours a week and have never been properly compensated in the 10 years they have worked here. They are both illegal immigrants however and are afraid that speaking up could lead to deportation for them. 

What I see is an employer hoping that ignorance or fear of the situation will keep workers for asking what they are owed. It’s very clear to me that my boss is up to some shady stuff and I do not want to stand for it. In the past week I not only received my my sick pay but also a small raise while my coworkers are still getting shafted. It sickens me that these men are being denied what they are owed, seems to me the boss is preying on their fear/ignorance of the situation. What is my recourse?

"A subscription service failed to cancel my subscription, resulting in overdraft fees. Are they liable? Hi all. I'd been subscribed to a major company's subscription service for about a year when, this past June, I emailed them requesting that the service be canceled, as I was out of the country. They responded, stating that my subscription would be canceled, and I didn't think anything of it.

This past week, I got a letter from my bank stating that I'd been charged $30 in overdraft fees. I was pretty confused, as I'd stopped using that checking account. After investigating, I saw a charge from the subscription service. After reaching out, they said that my subscription hadn't actually been canceled back in June. They immediately refunded all charges since I requested the cancelation.

I wanted to ask if they'd potentially be liable for the overdraft fee as well. Since they refunded it, I would guess that they've pretty openly admitted to having made a mistake. In general, is a company liable for overdraft fees if the charges are erroneously made?

"TX - Kids keep coming back from ex wife’s house covered in bed bug bites Posting for my cousin, he and his kids live with us. 

He’s divorced and has primary custody of his 2 girls (Age 3 and 6). For the last month whenever the kids come back from staying with their mom (every other weekend), they had been coming with bug bites. We have been taking them to the doctor every 2 weeks when they come back. After first we didn’t know they were bed bugs but as time went on their mother told the kids that she’s cleaned the bed, sprayed the beds with medicine, etc. and she also has the same bites. 

The last time we went to the doctor we were able to figure out that it was bed bugs and got the medication needed to help with this. My cousin has sent many messages to his ex-wife asking her to get rid of the bugs. He even offered to keep the kids with him until she was able to get it resolved. Today, when the kids came back, they were both covered with new bites. They look like they have a severe case of chicken pox, and it’s really bad. The old bites have scarred and the some of the new ones were bleeding. This is the 7th week they have been coming over with these bites. 

We’ve been to CPS before (the school had called them for some other issues) but CPS sides with the mother and didn’t even listen to what my cousin had to say. The kid’s psychologist has also involved CPS before and nothing came out of it. CPS has even tried investigating my cousin for abuse when the kids are clearly not getting abused with him. Not sure if going to CPS is a good idea for these bug bites since I don’t it to backfire. 

My cousin has told his attorney and she is also a bit hesitant to go to CPS with this. She wants to try talking to the ex wife’s attorney first. We don’t know what to do and in the mean time, the kids are being hurt.

"Was promised this new contract would not have terminations fees. Hey legal advice, just wanting some advice on my situation prior to me do anything rash. Will accept your judgement regardless. I’m in Australia if that changes anything. 

In July 2018, I signed a 12 month contract with an internet provider, everything was fine, internet was perfect, in early July 2019, I contacted them to let them know I was moving houses and if we could get my internet relocated to a new house on the same contract. 

The guy on the phone had told me we could do it but given how little notice I’d given them, it’d be easier to cancel my current service and just get a new one with the exact same terms and conditions of my old one. This is where it gets tricky, this next bit is all in a phone call, I let him know I didn’t want to do another 12 month contract as another provider had it much cheaper in the area I was moving to I just hadn’t had time to contact them and speak to their sales teams. He tells me it’s fine it’s no lock in contract etc, doesn’t tell me the terms and conditions least of all that an early termination fee applies. 

Fast forward to last night, I tried to contact them wanting to cancel as I’m getting 1/4 of the speeds I’m paying for (I understand traffic and all, but this has been a reoccurring issue for the past 3 months that people refuse to talk to me about), and I wake up this morning to no response from them, just an invoice saying “here’s your termination fees of $348, and you need to pay the next month of your internet even if you won’t be using it”.

Simple solution is contact their customer service which I will be doing today, if I need to pay the termination fees I’m happy to, but if I were to do a freedom of information for my phone call so they can provide training to the customer service rep to get it correct next time.

But we all love his girl. He just kinda shows up every once in a while.

So we’re at the bar, outside, and he starts going with the slurs and being inappropriate to another friend’s girl. I ask him to knock it off a few times, he doesn’t. He then starts targeting me directly with homophobic slurs. Now I’m telling him to stop. He doesn’t. I instigate a minor shoving match where he ends up on the ground and wrapped around both of my legs with me standing up. My hands are up, I’m vocalizing that “I’m done”. Eventually, after some coercing from some people he releases my legs and my buddy grabs me and says “let’s go”. 

So we walk out. We’re getting in the car, and the dude follows us out of the bar yelling his same garbage, I decide he didn’t get what he deserved so I walked up to him and popped him in the face.

I would like to get advice from this community how to proceed with my case. I live in a ""luxury"" apartment complex (part of a big chain) and we have a secure parking garage, where you need a clicker to enter the garage. We can park the car anywhere in the garage except for reserved spots or other obvious non parking spots. My car was parked in the same spot I have been parking for the last 1 year. Last night, my car got towed because the parking permit was not displayed properly. They gave me this flimsy parking permit which probably fell off from the dashboard and I did find it on the floor when i went to pick up my car. I paid the towing fees and got my car back, now when I contacted the leasing they said yes we don't give out tenant car information to the towing company to cross check and they did the right thing.

The lease doesn't say anything about displaying a parking permit or your car will get towed nor there is signage in the building that says a parking permit must be displayed. I would like to go to small claims court and get my towing fees back, also the time lost at work and for the inconvenience. Firstly, Do I have a case here? If I do, how should I proceed.

About 5 weeks ago, I applied for a receptionist/assistant position on Indeed.com. I received and email from a woman who explained to me that her old receptionist got married and she was in need of a new one. It was basic stuff, more of an assistant job (running errands and stuff). Now we only exchanged about 4 emails, in which I gave her my basic information (name, phone number, mailing address). 

Now I remember mentioning to my boyfriend that I thought it was sketchy because after I replied she instantly wanted to hire me. I said I was up for it, since the pay was really good. That was the last email I sent and I hadn’t heard from her since. 

Today, almost a month later, I woke up to an email from her explaining that she needed me to deposit the money in my account and buy some things for the charity she donates too.

"Secondhand smoke in Apartment can not get out of lease. - North Carolina When I went to look at my apartment in May 2019 everything seemed perfect so I signed my lease. I moved in on the first of June 2019 and that day when I walked in the entire apartment reeked of cigarette smoke. It was so unbearable I was not able to stay there for a few nights until it aired out. I contacted the apartment complex and they sent over a cleaning crew and told me that there's no way it could be secondhand smoke. After they cleaned and I went back into my apartment it still had a lingering smell but I figured it would just fade away once I got settled in. I was wrong. For the past few months, I have been dealing with the smoke coming through my vents periodically throughout the [day.](https://day.You) You can stand under the vent and smell the smoke coming out.  It is especially bad in the mornings. I will go to sleep fine and then wake up suffocating in cigarette smoke causing me to have horrible headaches. All my clothes, and other items smell. I have to rewash all my clothes and keep them at a friend's house. I have reached out several times to my apartment complex about it and finally after nothing changing, I asked if I could give a 30-day notice to vacate the apartment and their response was this:  

""WZP has posted notice after notice regarding the non-smoking in the building. It is currently posted now in the lobby in the lock box beside the elevator and there are no smoking signs on each floor of the building. If you know the specific apartment in which the smoke is coming from I would be happy to make an inspection of that unit and give them notice to vacate. Unfortunately it is hard to catch everyone there who is smoking in the building without others letting us know who the violators are. Please advise which apartment you think the smoke is coming from, there is apartments above, below and even beside your unit. But as far as you giving 30 day notice to vacate that will be a breach of your lease and you will be responsible for the rent throughout the remining of the lease term, through 6/30/2020 or until the unit is re-rented.

"Employer put a cap on PTO and then stopped accruals before the contract stated Hi all,

Located in Massachusetts. My GF is currently in a bit of Labor Law battle at work and I wanted to get people's opinions. She has been working at the same company for about 5 years and they have always (in signed contract) had 80 hours of PTO (sick/vacation combined) that they accrue throughout the year. This could be rolled over into the next year if unused.

In Oct 2019, the employer informed all employees that they will no longer be able to rollover PTO hours AND also stopped accrual of all PTO. 

I believe there are two things that are completely illegal about this but would love to here some advice:

1.) Upon basic research, I found if implementing a ""use it or lose"" policy,  the employer ""must provide adequate prior notice to the employee and must ensure that their employees have a reasonable opportunity to use that vacation time before losing it."" 

I think that 3 months is an unreasonable amount of prior notice. Some employees had over 100 hours accrued and rolled over and they are not allowed to use vacation time at month end, so it leaves roughly 11 weeks for everyone to force in their accrused and rolled over PTO. Do you agree this in not adequate?

2.) When they implemented this ""use it or lose it"" policy, they stopped accrual. By contract my GF should have received 80 hours this year by accrual. When they stopped accrual she had only accrued 47.5 hrs, this losing out on 32.5 hours of PTO that she would have continued to accrue. Is this illegal since she has a contract stating 80 hours of PTO?


Any help would be great. Thanks!",legaladvice,t3_dl6u2f

"Friend being manipulated in a divorce Divorce proceedings in Oklahoma

Alright so the whole situation is messed up but boils down fairly easily.  Friend of mine has been in a terrible marriage for many years to a man who is verbally and emotionally abusive, and manipulated her to get his way.  He threatens suicide any time she’s brought up divorce, or threatens that if they DID divorce he’d get 100% custody because 6 or so years ago she had a one night fling with a rando.  

Now she’s finally set on actually getting a divorce, but he’s locked down their finances and she can’t afford a lawyer.  They just had a huge blowup fight where he was yelling at her and then physically took her phone from her so he could yell at her more.  He’s pushed her to the point that she’s pretty much willing to sign any divorce papers just to get it over with.  Which is the problem.  He’s already said he’s putting language in the papers in order to control who the kids can be around even during when the kids are with her.  She said she’s willing to sign that, just to get things over with.  Those of us trying to help her have tried to explain he’s just trying to exert more control that extends past the divorce.  Here’s my questions:

1. What can she do if he’s locked their finances down and can’t afford a lawyer because of it?  Are there ways of making him pay all the costs and fees?

2. If these friends of hers aren’t criminals or somesuch, can be really decree who the kids can be around during the mother’s custodial time?  Or is that something a judge will throw out?

3. he keeps telling her he’s getting 100% because of the fling so many years ago.  Nothing I’ve found comes even close to that.",legaladvice,t3_dkyeej

"Apartment is charging me for damages to the bathroom done by a clogged up toilet. Edit 1: We live in Mesa, AZ.

A little background information.

My younger brother and I moved into an apartment on June 20th, 2019. Since then, there haven’t been any major issues with the new place, except for a shower head that wouldn’t stop flowing.

Anyways, over this past weekend my younger brother and I went back home (about an hour and a half traveling distance) to go hunting for the weekend. We both left on Thursday afternoon (October 17th, 2019) since we both had classes in the afternoon and wanted to leave right after our classes. However, I went back to the apartment to grab some stuff from my bedroom that I previously forgot. I went to the restroom and everything was fine.

Yesterday (October 20th, 2019) I come back from spending a quality weekend with my parents and younger brother hunting. Right away when opening the door to the apartment there was this strong stench throughout the entire apartment. I put my bags down and try to locate the smell. Brothers room? Nope. Living room? Not that either. I proceed to my room and sort of notice the smell is stronger in there. I step into the really small hallway connecting my bedroom to my bathroom and notice the carpet floor is wet. A couple of steps later the carpet is drenched, and then I proceed to open my bathroom door. There is literal shit and water everywhere, the stench is unbelievable. I look into the bathroom and notice my toilet is clogged to the brim. I back out and ponder what to do. The leasing office closes at 4pm and it was 4:35pm by now, so I try anyways. No answer from the leasing office, I hang up. My younger brother comes in five minutes later and I tell him what happened, he asks if I called the office, I told him I did and there was no answer. For some reason I thought the Henri app (a social network for the residents) would have an emergency contact information I could call or notify but there was none to be found. I should mention that around 4:45pm I submitted a work order.

It’s now 7:30pm and my younger brother and I are trying our best to clean the shit. The smell is awful and don’t really clean that much up, except for filling a bucket and dumping it. By this time we decide to go to a hotel for the night as the smell is still strong throughout the entire apartment. As we’re about to leave the downstairs neighbor knocks on our door. I get out of the vehicle and talk to her. Apparently from her words she smelled an awful smell around 2:30am that morning (October 20th, 2019), and around the same time we tried to clean some of it up (7:30pm) there was a leakage. I tell her we were gone all weekend and what happened to the bathroom and proceed to profusely apologize to her. She says don’t worry about it, it’s not your fault it’s the apartments.

Around 8pm that night I get a call from someone and proceeds to tell me the downstairs neighbor reported a leakage from above. This is probably the emergency contact person. He tells me that no one was at our apartment and wanted to know if he could have permission to enter, I tell him “yes” and don’t hear from him for the rest of the night.

This morning (October 21st, 2019) we go to the leasing office and surprisingly it’s open. We go to the desk and ask about our submitted work order for our apartment. We’re in for a surprise. The guy who wanted permission to enter, walks up to my brother and I, and berates up for leaving the mess and not cleaning it up and not calling the emergency contact. My brother tells him what is the emergency contact and he says to call the leasing office and eventually a prompt will follow where it’ll list the emergency contact. We didn’t know that. At this point, he’s still berating us and proceeds to tell us that they’re going to replace the carpet in the small hallway, and replace the wood planks in the bathroom. Then after all this he says, that they’re going to charge us because we came back at 4:30pm and he wasn’t contacted until 8pm to clean the mess, because the downstairs neighbor complained about a leakage.

I talked to a friend of mine and she suggested that I contact the city we’re currently living in or a lawyer to see if we have any rights of what to do.

"Fired over an emergency 2 months ago, just now find out the woman who fired me was never authorized to do so. Hi, so, a few months ago (early September or so) I was at the police station filing a report of a robbery. Long story short after informing my manager that I would not be in for my shift that day and why, I receive a text saying in more words than less that I'm fired.
This wasn't too horrible for me as I was planning on leaving, however, it did take away more than 2 weeks at least of work that I was planning on staying there. I only wanted to stay until my remote job picked up (it finally has though I'm not making a living from it yet and won't be for at least 3 more months.)
However the way she went about this was highly inappropriate and downright abusive. She was trying to guilt me into coming in saying it doesn't matter I was robbed because there is nothing I can do about it. I have never called out except once and it wasn't even with her. I picked up shifts left and right and was a very valuable employee as I was one of the few who actually fucking cared.
Turns out, this woman was temporary (I was unaware of this) and according to a friend of mine who still works there as an AM, she was never authorized to fire anyone. They just got their new permanent manager, and she was asking why I was still on the schedule yet never showing up for shifts.
I was never informed of this, nobody ever called me.
I feel like I have to have some sort of case. The negligence in that workplace was through the roof and after the first manager left, things went to hell. I know of at least a few times when I or others were asked to or required to work off the clock. The owner was a dick and didn't care about anyone but himself. If I can fight this and at the very least get the people who still work there better treatment than what they have now, so be it.

"UK - 19 year old being paid £1.20 an hour Serious responses only please. 
I have trained with a martial arts academy since I was twelve. This academy is well know in the UK for extremely high standards in student ability and very hard belt testing. 

When I was 15 I started to volunteer in the class before mine just to get some experience in working with children. Around the same time I was asked to help out at their summer camps. I was getting ‘paid’ £10 a day to work for six hours. Despite the fact that kids younger than me got £20 a day for the same work. 

Flash forwards a few years and I transferred to the main club in the franchise. I trained pretty regularly (twice a week) and paid £46 a month for classes. 
I was informed that I would have to ‘volunteer’ for twelve hours of coaching in order to get my black- belt. This is not what the guide lines by the British (being vague here) council say. It is also not a requirement at any other club. 
I completed my volunteering at the club by doing three hours before my lesson and then training for an hour and a half. This meant I got my 12 hours done in four weeks. 
I diddnt get paid to do this, despite doing the same job or even more responsibility than others who where getting paid. 

I saw a public announcement of a job in the onsite cafe for the club and was given the job when I applied. I was initially asked to work 3 nights a week but it was bumped down to 2. I made £7.50 an hour. I typically worked 3:30- 7:00 or 3:30- 6:30 pm. I never signed a contract and only got paid cash in hand. My wage slips said ‘volunteering expenses’ and often had the wrong hours on them.

Around the time I got paid for my first month in the cafe. I said I was going to stop coaching. The next month I got paid for coaching. But it was still only a small amount. 

The real issues started in the last few months. I stoped the cafe because it was causing me anxiety due to the nature of all the work to be done. The club hired two new people to work the cafe hours. But one got fired. I was asked to fill in (because I had the training). I tried to said I would rather be coaching, as it didn’t affect my mental health negatively. 
Some new people where hired to coach my lesson ( but we’re given contracts and paid decently). I eventually stoped doing the cafe but was not offed my coaching hours back. 
I was told I have to attend new training sessions, but won’t be getting paid for them. It is costing me more to get there at the moment. 
I have been told I have to pay class fees in order to work at the club. I have to work at the club in order to grade for my next belt. And in order to work at the club I have to sit an exam and attend training sessions ( to do with coaching) that I won’t get paid for but are costing me £8 a week to attend. I am a nursing student and just simply can not afford this. 
A friend ( only a belt lower than me) is also a nursing student, does similar hours to me and is only getting £20 a week. Her wage works out £20 a month. But it cost her £12.50 to even travel to the club.

"Is my Oregon attorney just unprofessional or unethical? My first time dealing with the legal system and court (received a DUII and reckless driving in Oregon) and I did not qualify for a public defender. My attorney was recommended to me from the state bar website. I can most certainly say that I got a poor recommendation and my attorney is not doing what should be expected from her. However, I’m not sure if it’s just laziness and unprofessionalism or if some of her behavior is beyond that. The two issues that I am most concerned about are the following: After I hired her, she requested an extension on my court date so she could have time to review the police report and other documentation. The week prior to my initial court date, she had her teenage daughter call me to update me on the situation. By teenage, I mean 16 at the oldest and not someone who is an official member of her staff, such as a secretary. The child introduced herself as “attorney’s daughter” and then stumbled through the call with my attorney in the background telling her what to say and correcting her several times. The next call I received from my attorney, she explained that she was driving so she had her daughter make the call and she even laughed about how awkward her daughter was on the call.

My other issue is that my attorney continuously tells me about her other existing cases. She never mentions names, so maybe that makes it okay? She has detailed to me three different cases. Most recently, she had been out of town for a case and when she returned, called me to notify me why I hadn’t been able to reach her. She detailed the case, telling me what town/court it was, what charges were held against her client, that the client was from out of state, and how long they were able to extend the court date for. She ended the story with, “I guess that just keeps them out of jail for a few more months” while laughing about it.

As someone who has never dealt with lawyers before, I don’t know what to think. She has portrayed a long list of unprofessional behavior that I am disappointed in but these two instances leave an especially bad taste in my mouth and I am not sure what to do about it. On our first meeting, we found out I used to work for her mother and I’m worried by this behavior that she is telling her mother or other people about my legal issues when she should not be. Please tell me I’m being paranoid and looking too far into these issues. Or maybe I’m not and you all have some advice? Thank you!

UPDATE:  was scheduled for court this morning at 9am. Somewhere between the court opening at 8am and my hearing set for 9am, my case was rescheduled. I was not notified by my attorney, who later told me she didn’t find it necessary to let me know because she just assumed I wasn’t going to show up since she didn’t receive my response from an email she sent me Friday that clearly stated “Since I have not heard back from the court we should be prepared to show up Monday” (I do have proof that I responded to her Friday). I will be filing a complaint based on this, having her daughter contact me, and some other unprofessional behavior that I didn’t feel necessary to include in the original post but may help paint a picture of her lack of responsibility and professionalism.

The mother tells her how she has wasted her life raising her disappointing daughter, that it's her fault the mother's life is bad. The mother is often saying that she should have left her daughter (at age 7) in America and moved back to Korea instead. The mother is controlling to the point where she is trying to live her life through her daughter. Last night while my gf was sitting on the floor, her mother came up from behind and struck her 4 times on her back and the back of her head with a closed fist. They had been arguing earlier that night and then made up, so the attack came out of nowhere. My gf is now at work afraid of going home. She has her own bank account but her mother has access to it, I told her to contact the bank and remove her mother's name from it. I am not sure what the laws are, if the mother needs to be involved or not? It's her account but I guess the mother is listed as a legal guardian and therefor has access to it, she has previously looked at withdrawals and questioned them. She goes under her mother's health insurance as of now. My advice was:

1. Contact the bank and make sure her mother can't freeze her assets or see withdrawals.

2. Get what she needs from their home while her mother is at work.

3. Tell the mother she is staying at a friends place, but not what friend.

4. Report it to the police, but she doesn't need to press charges right now (you can do that right?)

5. Start looking for more permanent place to live.

Did I miss anything? Was any of that advice bad? Any help is appreciated, I feel so fucking powerless, she is on the other side of the planet being abused by her own family and I am here just trying to be emotional support. What can I do? Help please, she works for a few more hours and we need a plan before the end of the day.

"Currently going through a divorce, wife is pregnant, not sure if mine, neither she nor I want me tied to the kid regardless, what do I do? First this post is on behalf of my friend who doesnt have reddit but is in this situation.

They were married for 3 years and while he was in the marines she had an affair, and shortly after he got back she said she was pregnant and didnt know who the father was. They separated after that and she is currently dating the other guy and said she doesn't care if he is the father or not they will raise the child. My friend is more than okay with that as he does not want children or to be tied to her.

"Acquaintance is offering large financial gift to help out with difficulties Asking for a friend (names are not real). Literally, as in my friend asked me for my advice and I am unsure what to make of it. My friend Danny is a single mother, and is part of a Facebook group for mothers (single mothers?). She has been having serious finantial difficulties involving having to move while losing her job. She was contacted by someone in the group, April. April messaged Danny and offered some money to help with her finantial difficulties. The message was roughly as follows:

&gt;Hey ___. I am from ___ parenting group. I know this is strange but I recently recieved a very large inheretance (that is, I will soon. It is ""in the mail""). I know my mother had a kind heart and would want to help and I want to help. I am expecting them in a couple days and I would really like to know how I can send you some money. I don't want you to pay me back, I don't need to know what it is for, I just want to know that this money would be helping you through this very difficult time in you and your child's life.

&gt;[Words of encouragement]

&gt;I don't want to accept no for an answer. I have been a frank mess because of all of this and to be honest I have just been wasting it on stuff I know I don't need to deal with my depression. I really want to know that something good will come out of this and helping a mother who is going through the same thing I went through several years ago, and that my mother was there to help me with is what I want to do with it right now.

To clarify

1. April seems to be a real person.
2. Aprils mother seems to have died recently (months of posts concerning her mothers declining health, including funeral and pictures etc.).
3. April and Danny are not ""friends"" or particularly close. Just have had small amount of contact through said group.

I, and Danny, are leaning towards accepting it, although with some reservations. As a non-lawyer/etc. my own main concerns would be: 

1. Whether it is April's money to give (what if she spends it on Bills/etc. and then it turns out it may have been stolen)

2. Whether she regrets this and asks for it later, and any possible difficulties related to this. 

I don't doubt that people really are this generous, but it both seems very plausibly like, ""legitimate"" but it is also tripping my ""too good to be true"" bells but I cannot see an obvious red flag here besides the ""free money"". Any advice or concerns are welcome.",legaladvice,t3_dl69vv
"Sold a car that broke down a mile away. I recently stopped by a small car dealership in the states of Florida. I was offered a used vehicle and agreed to pay $260 a month. The dealership is a buy here pay here type of place.

I am disabled and informed the owner of the dealership that I have no use of the left side of my body. I drove away from the lot to get gas and air in the tires. Unfortunately the vehicle would not start after that. I contacted the dealer and they said they would be willing to work with me and put me in a different vehicle as long as I can get the one I had back to them. With the help of a friend I was able to get it running and headed back to the lot.
Halfway there something happened to the steering and the vehicle almost pulled off the road. In my attempt to get control of it I was shot across a 4 lane highway and plowed into a ditch off the road. I was taken to the hospital and treated for pains related to the crash.
I contacted the dealer again and he said he was going to help me figure it out. It's been 2 days and I've been at the dealership both days all day since this happened.

"Mum can't seem to get widow pension after dad's death (almost a year) because the solicitor has been postponing due to this reason or that (UK). 1 year seems excessive. Please, please help. Is waiting this long normal? TL;DR - Solicitor has dragged out inheritance process for a year for various reasons, advising non-native mum to not apply for widow's pension yet. Savings running low, and I'm getting frustrated on her patient behalf

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My mum's husband (my step-dad) passed last year in November. She and I came to the UK to live with him after they got into a relationship in another country. So my mum has lived here with him for 20 happy years. After he passed away, mum had no idea what was in his will as he never talked about it. It seemed that she inherited the house, which she was happy about, but considering she has no other ties here in the UK, she might leave it to his children and go back to her hometown.

The main problem is the inheritance money he left for his whole family. She is in charge of contacting the solicitor - of the organisation my step-dad was a long-time client - and making sure the inheritance gets handled properly and will be in safe hands. It has been a whole year now, and absolutely nothing. She has been calling relentlessly, and the solicitor will come up with one reason or another as to why it's not done yet. But always with promises of ""just a little more to go"", ""just a week / fortnight left"" and ""I'll be in touch with you next week to update you"" - none of which have been true, and she has managed to drag it out for months and months. I am severely frustrated and so is everyone around my mum, but she insists we shouldn't raise a fuss yet as she believes it will all be done in due time and we should be patient. I can't help but think this woman is taking advantage of my non-native mum. But for what reason?!

Mum is living off of her savings (she is not working anymore due to age and illnesses), but of course they will be running out, and she is getting worried. She has been advised not to submit the Bereavement Benefit form yet until the solicitor has completed the inheritance process. Are they really doing their best, like my mum believes? Or are they taking some kind of advantage? The false promises every day, lack of contact and updates, and excuses (like when mum calls in a day after the solicitor missed their scheduled phone call, and the receptionist claims that ""she's (suddenly?!) on holiday for 2 weeks, so will call when she's back"".

I would post how both are worded, but it would give away some privacy information on all parties involved, but they essentially state the same thing, just a minor variation in the way its stated. Kind of like saying ""A potato is mostly starch"" vs ""Potatoes are mostly made of starch.""

We tried to play by their rules and just have them signed again, but we got immense pushback from the would be signees, and only got half of the required amount. They even went so far as to post hate mail on our clients door for having the audacity to dare ask for such a thing. What is really bugging me though, is the fact that we have the required signatures and information and company x is ignoring that. Are they legally required to acknowledge the loa's that we provided, or do they actually have the right to refuse the request because it does not match the format that they provided? Its putting our client in a tough spot that could potentially cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars.

In addition to the court case, her ex has been trying to get orders of protection, he has been opening up DCFS cases, and has been harassing her with night time wellness checks and every communication they have on Family Wizard results in an argument. He's basically using any legal means necessary to rattle her cage. In addition to all of this, we are worried that the ex is coaching the children because recently on his parenting time, the kids have been going to school and making claims of physical abuse against my partner. I have never seen anything during my time with her and her kids that would make me suspect that was happening or I would have contacted the authorities. I have every reason to believe that these claims are bogus and her poor kids are being used as a means to an end. I have a good relationship with her kids. They adore me and I try to take a role of the funny adult friend that they can have fun with.

My partner is working through the process with her attorney and the GAL and I'm trying to be as supportive as I can be, but honestly we feel helpless. The process is slow going.

My question is, how do I protect myself during this? Seeing the erratic behavior from the ex and the recent false abuse claims are making me concerned that it is just a matter of time before I'm targeted as a side channel way to attack her. Do I need to get an attorney of my own? What steps can I take to defend against the schemes of her ex? I have tried to stay out of it and I have very limited interaction with her ex. I attended a kids school activity a couple times because her attorney wanted a witness there. I attended a couple court dates for moral support, but other than that I have no interaction with him. Although, I would be more an happy to babysit the kids while she runs an errand, I am never alone with the kids out of fear that the ex will try something sneaky.

EDIT: Location, IL.

TL;DR My partner is in a very messy custody battle with her ex. Is there anything that I can do to protect myself from being pulled into it?

Thank you. I appreciate any advice that you can give me.",legaladvice,t3_dks0qv
"Screwed by car insurance company I'm currently 19 and recently got financing for a used car, and my step father co-signed with me. 

Before purchasing the vehicle, we made sure that insurance would be affordable through our families provider before purchasing the vehicle, we sat down with a woman at a local office and it was all squared away, paying 115 a month myself for the insurance.

Unfortunately, as of last week, the woman figured out that she had made a mistake, and corrected it without telling us. Upon my parents going in person to pay their portion of the insurance for a month, they were notified of the increase from 115 all the way to 310 a month for my portion of the insurance. 

The owner of the local office apologized and admitted their mistake, but told us nothing can be done.

The problem now is that I am going to school full time, and working 4 days a week in order to keep up with the car payment, insurance, savings for next semester, etc. which I now cannot afford because of the mistake made by the agency. 

What can I do legally?

"Slayer Rule - Murder-Suicide Hello Reddit,

My family has had the unfortunate burden of dealing with a murder suicide within the family. Long story short, my grandfather murdered his wife (my step grandmother). He called the police, admitted to the crime, and before the police could show up to the property, he took his own life. My father and grandfather have not kept in touch over the last 35+ years (I've never met my grandfather). We are not aware of any relatives of the victim, and assumed that we would be the ones to deal with the property while probate figures out what's going to happen. We have recently been made aware of the Slayer Rule, which prohibits the ""Slayer"" from inheriting anything from his victim. (We live in Oregon, btw). Does the Slayer rule prohibit my father (and his two sisters), from any inheritance? The victim has no children of her own. Thanks for any advice... This has been an emotional rollercoaster for everyone.

"Can I recoup money loaned to a parent before it gets used for Institutional Medicaid (Iowa) My mother had a bad fall earlier this year that required her to be hospitalized and then transferred to a skilled nursing facility. During that time I paid her mortgage, utilities, property tax, etc. She eventually made it back home and was able to repay me some of those costs.  
In August, she had some more problems that required her to go back to skilled nursing. I footed the bill for this month of care as it was not covered by insurance. The agreement was that she would pay me back when she was able. She has the money to do so in a traditional IRA, but I encouraged her to possibly wait until January 1 for tax reasons.  
She has been back home for a short while, but another problem has come up and it is everyone's belief that she would be better off in a long term care facility. I spoke with a facility in August and they explained that her pension and SS would be used to cover her costs and that her IRA would be used to cover the gap. Once that is gone, she would be covered by Medicaid.  
I would like to know if I have the ability to recoup this money before it is spent on her long term care facility. I am in no way trying to 'take' money from my mom, but simply want to be paid back for what I've spent.

"Mom got into an Uber accident as a passenger back in May 2019, lawyer finally comes back with a potential $100k settlement, but my mom only gets $20-25k. What gives? **\[Location: US California\]**

Hi guys, as you can see from the title, I'm a bit confused as I'm not experienced in legal issues. The settlement is not finalized yet, but the lawyer (FINALLY answered her call today, it has just been her and his assistant for the longest time) said the costs will be divided up so that $20k goes to medical (which I think was a small amount) and $20-25k goes to my mom. This mean he will potentially be pocketing $60k. It's not even 50/50. Is this normal? If not, how do we go about this?

I feel like this is not enough considering she has been kept in the dark by the lawyer for the past few months, just being told to go to the chiropractor, and had to dig for information herself to give to the assistant when it should have been his job.

"Last weekend my car was towed from my apartment, and I believe this was done erroneously. Can I do anything about it? This happened Friday, October 11th in Tulsa, Oklahoma. My car was towed from in front of my apartment for apparently being parked in a fire lane. I have reason to believe that this was done unfairly, and I think that the fire lane is improperly marked.

Here is a picture of where I was towed from: [https://imgur.com/W1DGqIT](https://imgur.com/W1DGqIT) (I was on the right side spot)

First, backstory: A couple months ago the parking lot here was scraped and repainted. While this was going on we were receiving emails that there would be 'new parking spots' available. In my corner of the parking lot there was a large area that had diagonal ""No Parking"" lines with a (very worn out) red curb surrounding it. The diagonal lines were scraped off during that time and a new Vertical line was placed. Looking at it objectively, it appears to now be split into 2 spots. You can see this in the image above. Even with a new line clearly painted here I was still unsure so I asked the office about it and I was told that unless there were freshly painted warnings/lines then the spot was now free. So I hesitantly started parking there (amongst others).

Weeks later, I found my car being towed around Midnight on Friday. By the time I went out there there was already a chain around my tires. I informed them about the lot being repainted, pointed out the newly painted parking line, and explained what I had heard and essentially got told that it 'wasn't there problem' and that they were taking the car anyway. The next day I had to pay $220 to get my car back, so now I'm trying to get that back. I attempted to go to my Apartment Management about the issue, but was brushed off and told I just simply shouldn't have parked there, even if one of their staff said it was okay. They said it was still a Fire Lane

However, using my most reasonable judgement (and anyone else I've shown this too), the zone is not properly marked as a Fire lane, and represents negligence on the Apartments for failing to correct it.

Here are a few more important notes about this situation:

1. There are indeed other spaces that have been repainted. They have clearly visible diagonal lines, a clear ""NO PARKING"" on the curb, and bright new paint. They are very clearly marked and easily identified. 

2. There is no visible ""NO PARKING"" text on the entire curb. You can faintly see where it was at one time, but it has been worn off and wasn't repainted when the rest of the parking lot was. There is no signage or text marking it as such.

3. While my car was being towed, another car was being towed to the space immediately to the left. The towing company told me that both of these spots were marked for tow. However, when I was asking about the space and showing the above picture, I was told that the left space was indeed a parking spot. This reinforces negligence on behalf of the apartment, who appear to be unable to communicate where no parking zones are located correctly.

4. Since the tow, I have seen 2 other vehicles be towed from that spot, and ONLY that spot. Again this is evidence that the spot is not marked in an obvious manner. 

5. The red curb that is visible wraps completely around the curb to the right. The space to the right of the curb is absolutely a valid spot (marked by a parking bumper). To me this makes the Red curb itself less less reliable, making it seem to simply be outdated. 

I am not one to blatantly ignore warning signs, and am very frustrated that this situation has come up. The spot seems vague at absolute best. Right now its more or less a cash grab for the towing company. My apartment has no interest in hearing me out about the spot and I'm unsure what my options are. The more I look at it the more annoyed I get with how much it obviously looks like a valid spot. I've even had to ward off a few others who have mistakenly tried to park there. No one here agrees that it looks restricted.

"[TX] Tornado hits previous rental, landlords had been renting it out prior to our lease end Hey all,

Please forgive the length of this post.

My wife and I recently purchased a house. After finishing our lease, we made an agreement via text message with our landlords to go month-to-month until we found said home, which happened rather early. We didn't give quite 60-days notice (~55 days) but ended up paying for September to end of October (31st).

As of last week, we were going back and forth with our previous landlords about stuff they claim we ""damaged"", after doing a final walkthrough with us and, through text message, we confirmed that the only thing we needed to repair was a floor scuff, and that they would get an estimate. (I understand that things can be found after but am also not dumb and they agreed to do a final walkthrough).

Well, last night our part of Texas got some pretty bad storms and a tornado ripped through the apartment complex. We immediately called our old neighbors to make sure they were okay and they thankfully were. 

The damage to the apartment complex is pretty devastating. We're having one of our previous neighbors stay with us at our new place until they can get things sorted out.

Lo and behold, when my wife went to pick up our old neighbor, she found out that our previous landlords had been renting the unit to a new couple, despite charging us until the end of the month.

I feel really shitty about posting this, because our landlord's old property get pretty severely damaged from the tornado, but we are both pretty livid that they would try to negotiate security deposit damage WHILE a new couple is staying.

What's the deal? Do we have any recourse here? I understand a lot of the end of lease stuff was made via text message so we might be screwed. The security deposit + half a months rent is multiple thousands and that is a lot of money to us.",legaladvice,t3_dl4zme
"$90 in 'admin' fees for a $12 toll bill? I recently got a bill in the mail from unpaid tolls from west Virginia. It was one of those times we didn't have the cash and we got a slip.

No that's not a typo and we went through the toll plaza on 9/9 so less than 30 days ago and this is the first notice we have received. We don't live in the same state and don't plan on returning (moving to Michigan) what are our options if any? Can we request to less? I can guarantee you they don't need $90 to process $12.

"[NM/Albuquerque] Breaking a lease due to unscheduled maintence hanging out at my home and going through items. Recently our property management has changed from one company to another, and during that time I had a maintence request put in due to a portion of the floor caving in on the second floor. This was outside by the front door and was put in with the old management company. During this request, the company sold our property to different management and I had to put the request in again. During this time I also stated that the cold water would only output hot water. They wrote both of these issues on a sticky note and told me they would have someone work on it. One day while at work I received a notification from my phone that there was movement in my home. I pulled up my camera later on in the day to just check on it and to my surprise someone was inside of my home. It was maintence so I thought nothing really of it until I watched the video footage. He was sitting around my house for about two hours, and going through items in my home. I brought this to the attention of management and they told me they would take care of it. This was also maintence from one of their other locations in the city so he didn't even work for our complex. Unfortunately due to this event I do not really feel safe at home with the idea of my camera going off and finding someone going through my belongings. He left the maintenance paperwork on my dining room table and it only stated that the front door might have to be replaced soon, and that he tighter the bolt under the sink.

"Rock'N'Play (Arizona, USA) We ended up in the hospital with my child after we discovered him blue on two separate occasions in a Rock'N'Play (the one that has since been recalled) last January.

So far, he has been a little behind on verbal development, but we are still within the normal range.

Where does the rest of the money go? I confronted her last night officially asking how the tips get divided because I’m having trouble understanding. She explained that the tips are divided between the front end and back end (cooks+dishwashers) and are divided by every hour everyone works. She also explained how its now a set $15/hr + no tips instead of $13/hr with tips because in the past the workers got upset for some employees getting more tips than them because they work the busier days.

She’s not that great at explaining things in English but she was saying how she has a whole team of financial advisors and her own CPA to figure all this stuff out implying that it’s all handled and taken care of. 
We also don’t get any of the cash tips in the tip jar because of her reasoning which is “People don’t tip that much so every week it comes out to $8.” So she pockets that I guess.

Bio dad (BD) gets wages garnished by state for child support however has nothing and wants nothing to do with raising child, which as far as i can tell by state statutes is considered abandonment even if he's paying support. Mother has sole custody visitation at custodial parent's convenience not that BD has ever, in 4 years visited, spoke to or reached out to custodial parent's or courts. Custodial parent has raised child since 2 months old with partner, now married over a year. BD refuses to give up rights so the person raising child can adopt them. The only reason BD gives is bc he won't have a right to see the child he has never attempted to see anyway then he blocked me. 

Can we force this in court? Or will it be a bunch of wasted money?  If we do force it, BD says they'll give him 50/50 or he'll push for a visitation schedule, so might as well not push it and risk sole custody. I highly doubt that but I've never been in family court. When the child was born we just went before a lawyer for the state and accepted her judgement bc I got full custody no need to push it to court.

He's never asked to meet or see our child, I think he's trying to intimidate me with threatening to actually have visitation.he's never asked and I wouldn't deny him a supervised by me visit with our child, supervised bc they've never met I'm not letting some stranger (to child atleast) take off with him and that's all perfectly legal according to the court order which is pretty vague on BDs actual rights but very to the detail what custodial/sole custodians rights are, which seems to be like everything?

"California, can I take a company to small claims court for $1300-$1500 Hi all, so I entered into a personal training program at a large chain gym in Southern California. My personal training contract stipulates that I’d pay $320 a month for a year. However, I moved for college and the closest gym location to my new place is over 50+ miles. I cancelled my regular membership and went through a lengthy process to cancel my personal training membership. At the end of it all, they said I could break my contract by paying half of the remaining balance in bulk or in payment plans. This came out to a sum total of $1300-$1500. I’m a broke college student, so I chose payment plan.

The catch is, there’s another option in the contract that says I can break it if I move away at least 25 miles from the closest club location. I’ve given my reason to several employees (including the one that hashed out my contract and ended my contract) at the gym why I wanted to break the contract: I’d be moving away, far from any of their locations. They just said okay, just pay the remaining half balance. Okay, I got into a legal agreement, and I intend to pay the rest.

"Can I get custody of my brother over state lines? Getting custody of brother out of state?

Alright, I don’t even know how to start this topic, so I’m going to try with a little pretext?

I live in Oregon, and have two half-brothers in Alaska who live with their mom, aged 11 (we’ll call J) and 17 (we’ll call R). I moved in with them in early 2012 at the age of 18 and took the position as their caretaker, due to their mom being extremely absent doing drugs. However, I didn’t realize the daunting task of raising 4-kids as a high school dropout working at McDonald’s was almost impossible. The only food they ate was what I could buy from my paychecks and what I brought home on my lunches/after night shifts.

I ended up joining the army and starting my own family in late 2012. I visited in 2016 after my tour in Afghanistan and was in awe at how they were living. They had hardly any food, there was minimal to no walking room in there due to the absolute mess. Their mom wasn’t home for the week I was in state visiting, so they stayed with me at the hotel. 

My sister recently moved to Oregon from Alaska, and told me the horrible stories of what’s going on at their house with the boys in the house. Meth being smoked in front of them, random people coming over and buying drugs out of the trailer they live in. Just not conditions you would ever want a kid in. 

My wife and I are buying our house in the next month, and I’m working on my bachelor’s degree at the moment. My wife and I discussed if it were possible to bring them from Alaska, we’d be able to raise them. We’ve talked with R about him moving here at 18, but we want to pull J out of that scenario ASAP.

I suppose the question comes down to this; is it even possible to get custody of my own brothers across state lines?",legaladvice,t3_dl4kjm
"Florida, my nephew is non-verbal autistic and was injured at school, but the school is ghosting us on the details My nephew is non-verbal autistic and attends a public school that is labeled as an ESE. Two weeks ago my BIL receives a phone call from the school indicating that he (nephew) had been in a fight and injured his lip and that it needed stitches. So my BIL starts heading towards the school when they call again stating that they were transporting him to the ER that was listed on his paperwork, just meet them there. OK, so no problem, by the time he got to the ER the doctor was almost finished gluing the wound closed, and then he was discharged to the care of his father. Now the ER did not offer any meds for pain, and all that they did was clean and close the wound. On Monday the 14th we took him back to his PCP due to the fact that there was still swelling. The PCP looked at it and said he suspected there was an abscess but the clinic was unable to do anything to it because of the location of the wound (face) he advised that we take him across the street the ER and have them drain it. 

We took him to the ER and they prescribed antibiotics. Now on Friday we took him back to the ER because it was clear that there was something more wrong. Due to my nephew's disability he can not tell anyone what happened or what is hurting so this makes it much more difficult, plus he has other issues where he can not sit still, etc. So armed with this info the ER decided that they wanted to do a CT scan of his jaw, but he would not lay down for the procedure, so they ended up sedating him, it took 4 different sedatives and over 9 hours to get him sedated enough to get him to lay down for the CT scan. 

The ER doctor reveals that the CT scan reveled that his jaw is fractured! He asked how this happened and all we can tell him is what we have been told, but he did say it would take force to fracture the jaw. This has been 2 weeks since he was injured at school and the school refuses to disclose what happened except to say that there was a staff member that has been placed on leave pending an investigation, but we have no idea what this staff member role was. Besides calling the school and talking to the principle, what else can we do? This is in Duval County.",legaladvice,t3_dkqhob
"Illegal Eviction? First time posting and first time having a situation like this. 

First, I'm a college student and I receive occasional financial assistance through a community sponsorship. Through some unfortunate circumstance I was left scrambling at the end of last month to cover some expenses---namely rent. My sponsors offered help at the beginning of this month and my apartment complex refused to work with my sponsors in covering my rent.

This has been ongoing for the entire month and I'm now facing an eviction. My complex received the monthly rent from my sponsor in the middle of the month but would not waive the late fees (nearly 400 dollars) and won't rescind notice to vacate unless I pay the late fee. These fees accrued due to their inflexibility and refusal to work with me and I don't believe they are owed any more.

I have enough evidence to come to the conclusion that my complex is run by a fraudulent group and giving them more money does not sit well with me. Leaving is not an issue to me as I intend to, however the date i was given is before the month ends, so my question is this: with my rent paid is it legal to evict me with only late fees owed? Should I cut my losses and just go or stay until the first, as technically I've paid for the entire month.

I haven’t seen the owner of this car in several months (old lady). The entire windshield is covered in 4 towing notices, and printed out rules citing HOA’s right to tow.

"Illegal retaliation layoff? I have been seasonally hired year round for the past 2 and a half years with a public parks department. I had made it clear throughout I was working to be made full time to eventually transition into a park ranger position. I was working as a parks janitor with some parks maintenance.

I had been accused of multiple things without proof (not doing the full job (I had asked for 2 years to take before and after photos, no follow up), ""snooping"" in my bosses office (he found my water bottle on his desk, likely left by a janitor) and not filling out time sheets for 1 week (as I had seen another worker my boss liked hadn't been doing it for weeks.) For the last issue he tried to give me a warning and I wrote that the other employee had not done it for months, it turned out to be weeks. 

After those accusations I asked my boss if someone else could be present from now on when he called me into his office. He ignored that the next time I went in and refused when I asked about it in person. When he asked why I wanted it I told him that I thought he was trying to lay me off/fire me on false premises, which made him angry. This entire time I was trying to smooth things over and so I went along with it. 

During this time I helped an old lady in a electric wheelchair cross over a sidewalk she was stuck on outside of the parks premises. It turned out she was the main legal disability advocate in my area, and so I was comended multiple times by his boss infront of our peers and was included in a district wide presentation on ""what it means to be a good (district) employee"" aka going above and beyond. *""you helped someone with a direct line to the superintendent"".

At the beginning of this month he wanted me to come into his office, again alone. He decided he wanted to go home so he said to come in first thing the next week. When I did he spent 10 minutes talking about how he used to be a runner (as he knew I was interested in longevity), and at the very end told me he would be laying me off in 2 weeks because ""the department could not afford to keep anyone on seasonally"". When I asked how long he had known this to only give me 2 weeks notice he said it had been ""for a while."" We settled on 3 weeks from then when as ""the department couldnt afford any longer"". 

*I found out he replaced me with another seasonal worker who had never done the job previously and had just started working that season.*

I have asked him 3 times now (politely) why I was replaced by another seasonal worker when he told me the reason for my layoff was because the district could not afford  to keep anyone on seasonally, and he has avoided the question every time. 

Does it seem like I have a case for a retaliation layoff?

TLDR was falsely accused, asked for someone else to to be present from then on during meetings (easily accommodated request), he refused, I was laid off one month later with the explanation the district couldn't afford to keep anyone on seasonally and was replaced by a seasonal hire in a completely different field who had only started just that season (ala he lied). Boss has avoided answering questions, saying theres no open positions and to apply elsewhere.

"Dog breeder initially offered refund on returned puppy, now ghosting us I paid a sizeable figure for a purebred dog not too long ago, which simply turned out to not be the right fit for our home. The breeder generously offered to take the dog back and even offered a refund. As we were super emotional about giving the dog up at the time, we elected to wait to talk about money until we had calmed down. But now, unsurprisingly, the breeder is not responding to our requests to discuss the refund.

I think the crux of this question is: since 1) the dog was healthy and of the advertised breed, 2) we're not talking about merchandise, and 3) the breeder verbally offered a refund, but not on record or in writing, do we have a leg to stand on if we take this to small claims?

"[CA] My housemate decided she's going to stop paying her half of the rent. Will the owners go after me/destroy my credit if I still pay my half?

We each have a co-signer, so there seems to be some differentiation. I.e. at the bottom of the lease is me with my co-signer and her with her co-signer, which implies that we are each half the lease, not co-signing with each other, although again, doesn't explicitly say that. 
 
She decided to move into a new place even though that means she can't afford to finish out the last three months of our lease, which we are still on the hook for. We've been trying to find someone else to move in and take over the lease, but no luck, and it's looking like we're going to have to pay November rent.

So I know that ""separated at birth"" folks are out there).

Son asked me for advice and all I could say is that a knock on his door by the police was a possibility, so he shouldn't have anything in his living room that could get him in trouble (he is underage for alcohol).

I live in a house in the state of Colorado with 3 other individuals. 4 people total. Only two of us are on the master lease (lets say ME &amp; Z). We were given verbal and written permission to act as sublandlords/master tenants for our home by the landlord. Which basically gave us the freedom to allow people to move in and out as we saw fit. As long as they did a background check with the landlord first and were approved by the landlord, they didn’t need to be on the master lease. So the other 2 people living in the house (lets call them A &amp; B) are not on the master lease. And have not signed a sublease either. Its only been verbal and text agreements between us (ME &amp; Z) and them (A &amp; B). They did do the background checks with the landlords and were okayed to move in. 

So last night, A &amp; B really got into it last night over A’s mysteriously broken belongings. They were slamming doors. Throwing around shit. Overall making a hell of a racket and just not being cool. Potentially causing damage to the walls and doors. Although I’m aware that is not grounds for eviction, they have also not paid ME &amp; Z the money owed for their agreed upon security deposit and utilities. As well as they were late with the last months rent. And i foresee them being late on next month’s rent. One of the individuals also made some veiled threats on their social media story as well as over text. I don’t fear for my safety but I do fear that my belongings may end “missing” as a misplaced retaliation for A &amp; B’s misunderstanding.

Is there an age where she can make that choice because it’s what she wants &amp; not because of extenuating circumstances (abuse, etc) ??

"Contract does not specify notice of leave time Hi all,

I am on a trial period at my job until 31 Dec, however, I would like to quit now. My contract only specifies that AFTER my trial period ends do I need to give 8 weeks notice. Can I give them however long I'd like since it's not specified? Ideally, I'd like to give them 3-4 weeks now.

To clarify further:

On page 1 of my contract, underneath trial period:

“Your trial period will last from the date of commencement of your part-time employment to 31 December 2019… *The period of notice that you are required to give during or after the trial period is set out in clause 1.1 (Termination of employment).*”

However, when you go to the Termination of employment section as stated above:

“*The period of notice required to terminate your employment during or at the end of the trial period is set out at clause 5 (Trial Period) above.* **After satisfactory completion of the trial period** (as determined by the Company), and subject to clause 13.3 below, the notice required by the Company to terminate your employment will be 8 weeks' written notice”

Only **after** my trial period does my contract state I need to give 8 weeks’ written notice. My contract refers to two places in the contract where the period of notice for my trial period should have been written, but these two places simply refer to each other and do not provide a specified time period.

So can I give them 4 weeks if I'd like? Thank you!

"Wondering if I have a case and should get a lawyer. Hello, I am writing to see if I have a case and should see a lawyer. Not sure if this is the place for this question.

So I hurt my back at work during December of 2018. Went to their insurance doctor. He just examined me, took x-rays, and He told me “you didn’t pull any bones so your ok to go back to work.” I didn’t like what he did, so I went to my own doctor and got a week off to rest. While I was off that week, I managed to book a second opinion but the appointment date was about almost 2-3 weeks away. So during those days I was working with back pain and couldn’t make it to work some days due to the pain. Almost got fired due to the points I racked up from those days off cause my boss and hr were wondering what was with all those days off.

Got the second option and she said it is work related and sent a report to their insurance. They only paid me a weeks worth of Workers comp. they sent me to a  doctor who specializes with back issues within my area. He Sent me to therapy which was only 12 visits.
Back felt better due to the therapy and store brought pain meds. Got my FMLA and got approved to take 6 days off a week for the next whole year.Fast forward to late july. My lower back still hurts and now affects my left leg and barely work one or two days a week. Sometimes I don’t work at all due to the pain. Doctor gave me meds but it’s basically just Tylenol.

"Accidental American - looking to renounce citizenship - what is my best course of action? Hello LegalAdvice,

I am under 18, will be 18 before the end of this year. I have just started working.

I have very recently become aware of the fact that I am an ""Accidental American"" - i.e I hold an American citizenship of which I had no idea of. I am in Australia, born to an Australian/American couple of which my father is American which is how I ""inherited"" the citizenship. I have an American Social Security Number.

I did some digging and I realised that not only do I have tax obligations even though I have never lived in, do not associate with or do not plan to travel to the US any time soon, I am also required to register for the draft.

I'm struggling to wrap my head around the process for renouncing my citizenship and any exemptions which may apply to me, I'm also looking to figure out if there are any tax related requirements I would have to meet before I am able to renounce my citizenship. Do I have to file any tax returns in the US before I am able to renounce even though I have never earned anything close to a taxable income? Is there any benefit to renouncing my citizenship before I turn 18?

"[CT] No longer receiving direct deposit, only business checks with no breakdown of taxes withheld or rate of pay. The amount is never consistent. Some employees are not being paid/haven’t been paid since last month. 
This is kind of a convoluted mess and I don’t know if it’s a legal issue, hypothetical legal issue, etc. I’m just in need of advice in case something illegal is happening. 

I’ve been at this place (a restaurant) for 3 years and some months. I had received direct deposit for most of that time. Recently no one is receiving direct deposit and rumor has it that boss man isn’t using our payroll company anymore so everyone is receiving what I think are business checks. Something that is confusing/worrying me is that the amount on the check is the same that I would receive after taxes withheld on my direct deposit checks. However, there’s no breakdown of anything being withheld so I have no idea if I’m actually getting taxes withheld or if this is just shady under the table pay to avoid paying taxes on his end. Not to mention the payroll paycheck stubs would also show my reported credit card tips. (When I file my taxes, I do report my cash tips to the best of my ability.)

When I confronted my boss he was dismissive. Other employees not getting paid at all is an entirely different legal issue I understand. Some haven’t been paid in upwards of a month to 6 weeks. 

Obviously something shady is going on, maybe the business is tanking. 

I’m here because I want to know what I can do to protect myself while I’m searching for other work. Hypothetically would these taxes withheld reflect on my W2? Do I cut my losses and jump ship? I can’t afford to not have any income currently as I live paycheck to paycheck.

"NY: Former employer purposely hid major health plan changes. I now owe money to doctors and can't pay.  

I'm located in NYC.

I'm on COBRA - the plan year started Jan. 1 2019 and was suppose to renew on Jan. 1 2020. There's no in-network deductible and I reached the out of network deductible in April 2019 so I now get 100% reimbursement for about $5K in medical expenses monthly. I have a serious life-threatening illness and I have doctors' appointments three times a week minimum. 

In August, I noticed my claim payments after July 1st were being unusually delayed. I called my insurance carrier who stated this was due to my former company rebuilding the plan. I reached out to the company's benefits manager via email and she replied that there some backend process changes, but no changes to the health plan. I eventually received full reimbursement and thinking the issue was fixed, continued with appointments in September and October.

However, I just discovered my deductible was reset to zero on September 1st. Without my knowledge I was charged the full deductible and co-insurance, leaving me holding the bill for $2000 in unpaid doctors' bills. I can't afford them and I will probably need to end service this week.

I found out that my former company changed the plan's coverage date from Jan. 1 to July 1, 2019. They then cut off the deductible year in September and didn't tell anyone. I asked the manager why she didn't tell me about the changes when I asked or disclose the changes to the plan prior to July 1st. She stated she found out after we spoke and they didn't tell anyone because this only affected the out of network (which is not true) and very few people go out of network.

That's insane.

I already spoke to the Dept. of Labor and they needed to provide notice within 60 days the change went into effect. DOL doesn't penalize, but It's also a major violation of the ACA - and is considered a criminal act because a major change to the deductible period was intentionally not disclosed. They're also required to provide a summary benefit plan and the didn't do that either.

A lawsuit will be hard because I signed a release for severance. And it makes no sense to hire a lawyer for 2K - and I don't need a lawsuit. I just need that money as soon as possible because certain medical services will be cut off soon.

My instinct is to write a calm and unemotional letter to the head of HR and explain the facts and that I need to be reimbursed this week. They know a lawsuit doesn't make sense. But does it make sense to say they're violating the ACA so they understand I mean business? Or will it just alienate them further?

Also, how do you report ACA violations? I only get directed to OSHA - and that only provides whistleblowers protection from employer retaliation, but I'm on COBRA. How do you report a violation like this?

This is not an issue for appeal. My insurance did everything they could and knows the company is wrong. They aren't responsible for notifications - the employer is. This is about nondisclosure to plan participants and I need to deal directly with them.",legaladvice,t3_dknylf

Little background , I have strong allergies to perfume and bleach and they can cause me to go into anaphylaxis. Work is aware and although they claim to try to “accommodate” me they will not post any signs or institute a “fragrance free” policy like other similar medical offices. Last year after a reaction I ended up in the ER and work would not let me back “for my own safety” and after getting a lawyer involved it took 3 months before they allowed me back, all going unpaid.

My new problem is that I had another reaction last week, this time caused by pure negligence. All my coworkers are aware of my condition and have been educated and one of them decided to spray large amounts of perfume in a common area without any warning. I immediately went into anaphylaxis and was taken by ambulance to an ER.

"Wrongful termination or retailiation? Worth pursuing? Was terminated on the same day I reported my boss to HR for harassing and berating me a few days earlier. I was a temporary worker and originally supposed to work for 3 months, after which I should have got a pay increase. I had a family emergency (my parent was dying) during which they still expected me to work, my boss even pointed out that I didn’t have FMLA. They also threatened to terminate me if I did not return on certain day after a funeral. I returned with a few weeks left in my original 3 months; they decided to extend my employment and didn’t let me know until after I asked  an unrelated question about my pay. They say they extended my employment because of my family situation. They continued to pay me the same amount, someone at a similar step received a $3 per hour increase. It’s 75% of what they reposted the position at because I had no experience. They used this to their advantage and never had any intent of keeping me. They pretty much used me because they could and I didn’t have any protections as a worker (no fmla).

Hi reddit, so I’ve been dealing this with a few months now but it hit a point over the weekend where I realised something needed to change or something was going to go wrong. Let it be said that I worked the doors of night clubs for years and had similar issues but nothing that continued like this so I’m not sure if I’m being pedantic.

For the last few months I’ve been working the fresh produce at a large supermarket chain in Melbourne, Aus. Shifts are crap and I mostly work nights so it’s not a job I’m dying to hold onto.

One of my superiors on these night shifts had always been a bit of a flirt asking me what I’m doing after work etc. but to the point where I had to stop being polite and say I really wasn’t interested. Then he started referring to me as his bitch on the shop floor in front of other staff and customers to the point where it wasn’t even cheeky but just awkward and would make me super uncomfortable so I again shut that shit down.
So this past Friday night rolls around, It was my birthday on Saturday and some people at work knew about it. He caught wind and spent most of Friday night creeping up behind me and asking what “we’re” doing later.
I lost my shit though when it was the end of the night I was loading the cool room in the back with no one else around. When he walks in and goes in for a hug and a kiss like we were hiding some passionate love affair.
I stepped back and lost it. He said something like he was only play fighting or something like that and I told him I would’ve punched him either way, it ended with him apologising and me leaving before I’d wrapped up my work. I just have this gut feeling that this really isn’t the end.

"Issues with my new PCP and clinic staff - more of a vent session, but open to advice. Location edit: Illinois

8/28 - Saw my new PCP for the first time, had intermittent pain symptoms all over my body (ribs, back, chest muscle, sternum, fingers, toes, and various random skin areas) along with perpetual fatigue, trouble sleeping. Got labs done, tested for Gout, testosterone, inflammatory markers. The doctor seemed to be genuinely concerned. This was the first and last time I would speak to him directly.

9/14 - finally got initial lab results after several phone calls, they said labs were mis-handled with the upload into the system, doctor wasn't notified, they didn't get published to my patient portal. Doc said my testosterone and B vitamin levels were low, got B vitamin supplement, re-test testosterone in the morning (when it's normally highest), but ok to wait until November physical. I decided not to wait.9/17 - got my testosterone re-tested

9/24 - no results yet, called 3 times trying to get results, they said results were back 9/19, but since testosterone was in the normal range (302 - bottom end of normal is 300), they said they wouldn't call unless it was abnormal and completely ignored the symptoms I talked to my doctor about. No care summary, no instructions, no referrals, nothing. Talked to the clinic manager about not being happy about my symptoms being ignored. A few days later got a referral to podiatrist and orthopedist (i have an hmo) to possibly help - THIS IS A MONTH AFTER MY FIRST APPT WHERE SYMPTOMS WERE DISCUSSED. I contacted the clinic manager's boss and filed a complaint which only resulted in the clinic manager calling me to apologize for the nth time while still not fixing the problem.

Earliest appt with the ortho 10/23, so I waited to see if I could change my plan/PCP since I expect better care (maybe it's just me, but they failed multiple times in my book) and there's no ortho in my HCN, so I wasn't sure it would even be covered.

TODAY - called the orthopedist to schedule an appt after a flare up of pain symptoms, NO REFERRAL IN THE SYSTEM. Called my PCP office, NO RECORD OF ANY REFERRALS OR NOTES ABOUT GIVING REFERRALS. Still no notes about any care summary, my symptoms, or follow-up. Finally got them to send the referrals today and have to wait 48 hours for the referrals to be accepted.

I am turning 40 next week and have never had this many problems with a doctor/clinic in my life. I've changed insurance and doctors at least a dozen times in my life due to work, moving, etc. I contacted the corporate office and they sent an urgent message to the clinic manager to call me to explain why the referrals were not entered and why there is no notes regarding what we discussed.

"[California] Was found at fault for auto accident, I have low coverage. What to do about Subrogation, ?? Was involved in a car accident back in March 2019. I'm a 24 year old broke college student and only bought the state Liability limit of Bodily injury 15k per person/30k per accident and property damage of 10k. 

I received a letter of subrogation because his claim is $15667.51 for the car. They want me to pay $5717.51. 

My questions are
1) Do i have to pay? I am unable to pay financially so i was wondering if there is any way to get this amount lowered?

2) To my understanding this is the amount for property damage. If the bodily injury claim exceeds the amount of 30000 would I also have to pay that difference?

3) What can i seriously do? I learned not to buy the cheapest insurance from now on. Regarding this situation I feel lost, I would appreciate any advice.

"DUI :( So I got a DUI on Thursday Oct. 17th for a lane violation (crossed double white) in Adams County Colorado (I live in Boulder). This was my 1st DUI and I blew a .098 at their station.

I know my points on my license will exceed the 12 points from previous speeding tickets unfortunately, so I was wondering if that initial hearing was necessary for anything, other than to determine if one is eligible for the Interlock system? I'm assuming I'm definitely not eligible for that, so will my license suspension will start now? or is that why I have to do that hearing to start the one year suspension?

"5 months old car, brought for manufacturing issue is gave back in a messy state. Hi,

I bought a car, brand new less than 5 months ago. After a few months i saw it was leaking water. I contacted the dealership and brought it in. It was a manufacturing issue with a broken pipe behind the dashboard. They kept it 3 weeks(on a forum a few other user with same issue told me it was fixed in a matter of days for them), removed the dashboard and put it back. My wife went to pick it up. That evening, I looked at the car. The dashboard was put back wrong (pieces on top instead of under, glove box not closing properly anymore, glue EVERYWHERE, etc...) I contacted back the dealership, they told me to bring it back, they can ""fix it"".The car isn't even 6 months old. That will be the second time they take the dashboard out.They are covering the costs. That is not the problem. The problem is that the car is brand new and already has been taken apart twice.

"(NJ US) My boss has vocalized to coworkers that they are intentionally treating me badly (shorting me on pay, overworking me, allowing sexual harassment to go undisiplined) because I am of a different social class and culture/race than them and they don't 'like' me. They are also comitting fraud. I would like to know what laws are being broken, what and how to document so that I might seek a lawyer, and what legal options I might be able to take against my employer suchas reporting them to the IRS. 

I will try to keep this concise.

I have been working the same job (line cook/garnier) for about 3 years. 
About 8 months ago our Sus Chef quit. The owner has made every excuse as to why they haven't hired anyone to replace the position (and a second position in back of house) leaving us short staffed and worked raw for nearly a year now.  In the meantime because I have the ability/experience to do so, I have been fulfilling all the tasks/responsibilities of the Sus Chef position. The employer has acknowledged verbally to me that they are fully aware that I am working the Sus Chef position but refuses to give me the title or pay increase and refuses to tell me why. The employer has said to other employees that it is specifically for classist/racist reasons (I am poor white trash and they are upper class Chinese, we are both female if that matters).

They have been shorting my pay significantly for the entirety of the time I have been with the company. How they do this is by paying me half on the books and half off the books. They have me work on average 45-55 hours per week, but do not pay me for overtime and only record/tax 20 hours per week. Everything over 20 hours is only recorded on my punch card (which I have photographed). 

This is tax fraud, correct? I have told the employer multiple times that I am uncomfortable participating in this arrangement and they have ignored me.

I have been sexually harassed (forcefully kissed and groped by an off the books dishwasher who was fall-down drunk on the job at the time) threatened and bullied by 3 different male coworkers (I am female) over the last 3 years. These incidents were all on camera and all had witnesses. When I brought it up to the employer nothing was done. No diciplinary actions were taken. It has been allowed to continue on a near daily basis for over 6 months straight. 

I have diagnosed PTSD/anxiety disorder due to my nervous system having been both physically and psychologically damaged in an incident where a stranger attacked me while yelling sexist slurs and  nearly killed me/tried to kill me (I have a permanent physical injury do this) .

When I had a string of severe PTSD attacks at work due to the constant harassment and physical exhaustion I was finally forced to disclose this personal medical information to the employer.  The employer told me- and this is a direct quote- that I am 'weak' that my illness 'is not real and is just weakness'. I told them that it is real, that my nervous system is physically damaged and I am under the regular care of a doctor (twice per month) because of it and have medical records to prove it. 

My employer is also aware that I have been homeless since April because even working well over full time, they are not paying me enough for me to afford rent anywhere within an hour commute. They have been stringing me along all summer claiming they will soon 'fix my pay'. They have told me this 4 times and never actually done it. 

What can I do? I am definately going to leave the job (as are many of the other employees, for similar reasons) .

Can I leave a voice recorder going in my pocket and try to get the boss to say these things directly to me? 

If so, what are some example questions I might ask, do I need to use specific wording or get then to say specific words?

I understand I likely have no recourse to recover all the overtime I have not been paid for, or to press charges for the harassment/discrimination. That sucks, but it is what it is.

I would, however, like to report the business to the IRS and/or any other appropriate tax or labor rights organizations. Honestly, I would like to do everything in my power to destroy the business so they can't do this to anyone else in the future. 

I have not quit yet and the boss is never around. So, I can photograph time cards etc as proof of all the off the books workers. What should I photograph? What can I legally document?

I have multiple coworkers who are witnesses to my claims and/or have had the same done to them.

Should I contact a lawyer/attorney? If so, what type?

Thank you in advance and I appologize for formatting. I am on mobile.

Please let me know if I should edit in any further information.

Edit: I would also like to know if recipes are considered 'intellectual property'. The restaurant uses a couple of my original recipes on the menu. These did not come from books or the internet. I made them up myself. I can prove there are no identical recipes online by simply googling it. These dishes are very popular. Can I force them to not use my recipes once I quit? Also, can this be used as proof that I am infact doing the job of sus chef while being paid the rate of an entry level inexperienced cook? Chefs make recipes for menus, cooks just do what the chefs direct.

Edit 2: I also am not allowed breaks. I work on average 9-10 hour days and sometimes as much as 14-16 hour days with no breaks. I have never once been given a break in the 3 years I have worked at this job.

I also basically cannot take days off. We have been so short staffed for about 8 months that if I call out it hurts my coworkers. I care about them, so for example today I woke up with a fever and stomach problems but have been on the clock for 9 hours already with 2 yet to go. There are 3 of us working a line/menu designed for 5. All three of us are working a double and there is no one to call in for relief. This *has* to be illegal? Right?

My therepist thinks this job situation is affecting my health. My massage therepist (I go for pain management due to a permanent injury) thinks there is an injury to my right shoulder caused and perpetuated  by the shoulder being injured and than overused/not allowed to heal due to my job.

"Breaking a apartment lease early So my husband and I moved into a ""luxury apartment"". First day the never cleaned the apartment. The rug was dirty, the counters and mirrors weren't clean, there was pasta in one of the cabinets, my feet turned black when I walked in the bathroom.

Lastly, our dryer does not dry out clothes all the way. We tried putting it in multiple cycles less clothes. Doesn't work.
 With all that being wrong on day one we hit them up we also offer to move into a diffrent unit because this one seems not ready there is so much wrong (there was a few more things but they actually fixed them.) and they say they will fix it, And when everything is fixed we will clean the apartment. They give us a new dryer, they put in an order for a new bedroom window, and ""fix"" the faucet, toilet, and hot water.
  So now it's our 2nd month there and they haven't replaced the window, the dryer doesnt work still, everything in the bathroom is still broken. We hit them up again. We tell them everything that is broken again now there is a small stream of water it's not just dripping. We have bad allergies and this crack in the window is making it worse. And our dryer is still broken we can't go to a cleaners for the time being because I have a very bad bleach allergy and my husband is very sensitive to scents. We need this fixed in our unit.

"[CA]No window locks, mold in water heater, angry tenant Hi,

I moved into an apartment August 1 with my wife and baby, and we've had nothing but problems.

After moving in, we noticed that none of the seven sliding windows locked in our ground floor unit--wooden dowels were used instead. It took **56 days** after notification for a repairman to be sent, who showed up with a handheld vacuum and cheap [window stoppers](https://imgur.com/TE1OXRz). These were screwed to the window tracks, creating the annoyance of having to unscrew them to open the windows and then reattach them when wanting the windows closed. Frankly, I'm uncomfortable using them because I believe they create an unnecessary fire escape hazard as they aren't quick release.

The other big one is disgusting and infuriating. After the first time using the washing machine there was a horrible smell of rotten eggs. We notified management, they sent someone to fix it, and told us it was fixed. We used the washing machine a second time, it still had the horrible smell, and again someone was sent to fix it, and again we were told it was fixed.

The third time using the washing machine, some of our baby's clothes looked as if mold had seeped into them. A plumber was sent, who found that mold was growing in the hot water heater, told us that the water was contaminated, and we should probably throw away our clothes, *especially* the baby's clothing.

By now we're furious. Our baby has been wearing this stuff, we're talking at \*least\* $1k between clothing, bedding, burp rags, etc., and yet the property management has said the property owner isn't responsible for the clothing and we should submit a claim with our renter's insurance. We have a $500 deductible and don't see how this is our responsibility.

At this time I started poking around the law and learned that our unit was legally uninhabitable because of the window locks. Clearly IANAL, but my interpretation of other laws make it appear the property owner is **entirely** responsible for the damages to our baby's clothing.

So after 2.5 months, we just want out. We informed the property owner and have exchanged just a few emails of negotiation, but they're behaving like bullies, using the fact that my wife and I want to be out by the end of the month as she returns to work beginning of November. Their last offer was, ""as a courtesy,"" ending the lease October 31st but will offer no further compensation and no further consideration ""beyond that.""

I haven't yet brought up the law, and if we had more time, I'd dig my heels in and fight back because I believe the law is entirely on my side. So now, the questions:

* Do those window stoppers satisfy Civil Code 1941.3(a)(2): Install and maintain **operable window security or locking devices for windows that are designed to be opened?**
* Does the condition of the hot water heater and washing machine violate Civil Code 1941.1(a)(6):   Building, grounds, and **appurtenances at the time of the commencement of the lease or rental agreement, and all areas under control of the landlord, kept in every part clean, sanitary,** and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents, and vermin?
   * On this, does Civil Code 1714 (a) apply as it states: Everyone is responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, **but also for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her property or person,** except so far as the latter has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or herself
      * Finally, Civil Code **1929** states: The hirer of a thing must repair all deteriorations or injuries thereto occasioned by his want of ordinary care.

If you're still with me, thank you, I'm just about done. The big question is **what can I do**?

I believe our lease was not signed in good faith, and breached by the property owner according to Civil Code 1942(a) which reads:   If within a reasonable time after written or oral notice to the landlord or his agent, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 1962, of dilapidations rendering the premises untenantable which the landlord ought to repair, the landlord neglects to do so, the tenant may repair the same himself where the cost of such repairs does not require an expenditure more than one month’s rent of the premises and deduct the expenses of such repairs from the rent when due, **or the tenant may vacate the premises, in which case the tenant shall be discharged from further payment of rent, or performance of other conditions as of the date of vacating the premises.**

I'd be more than happy walking away and going to small claims court, but it's a gamble as they still have our deposit of 2x the rent. We haven't agreed to their offer, nor have we seen lease cancellation agreement, but to just accept their condescending ""courtesy"" makes my blood boil, while the clothes my baby has worn makes me vengeful.

Thank you so much!",legaladvice,t3_dklqke
"Tesla is not acknowledging an obvious major defect, but the defect is technically “within specs”, is there anything I can do? The car is rated for 310 miles of range, and it is currently at 260 at a full charge. That’s a 16% drop in 20k miles. Normally, assuming no defects, it should be around 2-3% of degradation.

I have confirmed this with multiple 3rd party apps that aggregate the entire fleet’s data and I am literally at the bottom 0% (literally no one in the fleet is worse than me).

The tricky part is that when you buy Tesla’s vehicles, their contract states that their warranty covers it if the battery is degraded below 70% (aka 30% degradation) within 120k miles. It is pretty obvious they put that in there to avoid having to ever replace anything. Realistically, it would take ~500k miles of driving before a battery would reach that point. But I am over here with 16% in merely 20k miles. Tesla is also unwilling to release their data on my car and is claiming these 3rd party apps are not reliable. Even though these apps are just using Tesla’s own unofficial API.

Is there anything I can do? There is an obvious defect to my car, especially when compared to the fleet, and the degradation has effectively removed the $9000 I paid for the longer range. The dollar amount seems too small to go to any court or arbitration. Is there any other alternatives I have? What I want out of this is for them to either fix the issue (replace battery) or refund me of the cost I paid for the longer range upgrade ($9000).

All I paid for at the school was my application fee and because I was originally intending on going, a non refundable $200 deposit to sign up for classes and orientation (something along those lines).

The program will give them a better understanding of their needs and will help them get an idea what sort of jobs they could excel at.

"Paying child support electronically - pay by the 1st or due by the 1st? Until recently my ex-wife has had a checking account at my financial institution, and I've been paying child support to her via electronic transfer.  Since both of our accounts were at the same bank, I could log in to the online banking system, make the transfer, and the funds would immediately be visible in her account.

Now she's moved her checking to another bank, and I still have the ability to transfer funds to her new account electronically through my online banking system, but the transfer is no longer immediate - now it takes about 4-5 days to process.

Our separation agreement says I will pay on the 1st day of each month, I'm trying to determine if that means I'm OK if I initiate the transfer on the 1st, or if the money needs to be in her account on the 1st (which would mean I'd need to initiate the transfer approx 5 days before the end of the previous month.

"Furniture store dispute &amp;#x200B;

Around Sept 15ish I went to a furniture store near my house(went there with my dad previously, he bought a few items).  The reason I came back is I was previously offered the next time I come and order something if the total is over $2k he would take $200 off.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a bedroom set, a mattress and a sofa set.

The total came up to 3400.  My wife and I put down about 650\~.  The salesrep(we found out hes the manager) agreed on a Oct 20th delivery.  We said we would co.e back this coming Wednesday and put down another 1000.  No issues so far.  Come Wednesday I had to work late next few days and I was busy at work.  Didnt get out till after store was closed.

&amp;#x200B;

He called friday to ask about the payment.  I apologized profusely for being negligent.  He said no issue, just come I  tomorrow and pay the money.

&amp;#x200B;

Go in Saturday, pay what we could to bring the total down to $2500.  It wasnt the $1000 promised but he said that shouldnt be an issue as long as we paid by delivery day which then we both confirmed to be the 20th.  I then take a look at the invoice (should have done this way before, but as my wife kept the invoice I was unable to).. I asked him about the discount he previously mentioned.  He said not an issue he would talk to his boss and get that added.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, he said was busy so we paid with a different sales rep. We again confirmed with him that we were still set for oct 20th delivery.  He said yes of course.  I also told him next payment would be close to the delivery day as we have some renovations going on and I would be super busy to come in to pay. He said that's quite alright.

&amp;#x200B;

He then called the owner over and said what a lovely family we were, and started ranting about how my dad came and bought somethings and how I came now and that we were so lovely... lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to oct 19th.  I go in with pretty much the full payment.  I ask him about the discount and he said not to worry he hasnt talked to the boss yet but he would.  I then said when would he talk to him as delivery is tomorrow oct the 20th.  He then said sir I'm sorry but we dont deliver on sunday.  I said but the previous two times I was in the 20th wasnt an issue.  He said I should have known they dont deliver in sundays no one does.

I told him how would I know as nothing was told to me.  He also said I havent even paid in full(another thing that wasnt told to me) and told me delivery cant be made unless paid in full.  I told him again this was never discussed.

&amp;#x200B;

I pulled out the invoice and showed him the delivery date.(so this is my big mess up) the date on our invoice was empty, nothing written.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him to pull his out and it showed some abbreviations with del atr ar.  No clue what that means but I'm sure he wrote that in after we left.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him again why he wouldnt give us the full information.  He goes sir you should know this everyone normal goes to church on sunday no one works.  Which I found highly offensive as I'm Muslim and church on sunday is not a thing.

Though I ignored it.  He then pushed my daughter away as she went to him(he was previously very nice to her) so she went to say hi and play with him.

&amp;#x200B;

I got infuriated when he did that and said your an asshole. I then asked for a refund, to which he rectorted we dont give refunds sir you  should know that. I said how am I supposed to know as none of this information was given to me.  I asked when his boss would be In and i would come back then(at this point i was shouting)( I cant stand anyone that hurts my girl)

&amp;#x200B;

My wife started explaining the situation to him as I'm fuming away and I pull her and said let's go you dont need to explain anything to this asshole.

&amp;#x200B;

He then said mam you want me to call the cops on him for you.  We then walked out(I stormed out).  We took a cab to a restaurant we were planning  on going to after.

&amp;#x200B;

Once we get in I notice a pin sized scratch on my daughter's face.(shes 3 if that matters) I was about to go back, and ask the guy wtf.  As he was the only one that touched my daughter to push her away.  My wife stopped me a d told me to relax(which I got angrier about) but since I was getting food I focused on eating rather then another confrontation(this time with my wife).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I look at the invoice, there is no policy written of  no refunds.

&amp;#x200B;

What can I do to get my money back, as I'd like to not do anymore business with them.

"Is what the 92 yo man at the dry cleaners said true? So last week I was at the dry cleaners dropping off a pair of pants. The clerk (a 92 year old man) started asking me questions like “how much is the national debt”  “who do we owe it to” and “how many people are there in China vs the US”. I’m a high school debater and the current topic is related to China and trade deals so I roughly knew the answers and he was surprised so he continued talking (for way too long). 

Apparently he asks these questions to everyone he interacts with to assert his superiority, as he said he asked a couple earlier and they didn’t know. He also goes to the bank around the corner just to antagonize the manager about economics. 

Anyways, after he’s done questioning me he tells me that he hasn’t payed income tax in 40 years because he took the IRS to court and without hiring a lawyer, he singlehandedly defeated them after an epic battle using only the constitution as that’s the ‘real law’, not the statutes and regulations that ‘they’ try to enforce because taxes are communist, communist manifesto, he’s a real american blah blah blah. 

He then goes on to say that since I seem like a bright young man, he’s going to pass on some secret information to me so that I’m not just another one of the masses. He writes down on a piece of paper “HJR 192” and tells me to look it up as it will change the way I think of things and it will ‘keep me up at night’. I looked it up out of curiosity when i get home and it’s just some law passed in 1932 that did away with the gold clause in the constitution and in all public and private contracts. He said this is some secret truth that the government is hiding from us and that him telling me this is planting a seed in the future of this country and that because of this law, people aren’t actually required to pay taxes.

 Ofc I don’t really believe him but it’s kind of intriguing tbh. So if any of y’all actually understand what HJR 192 is, is there any truth at all to what this old man was saying or was it simply the senile ramblings of a “real American” ?",legaladvice,t3_dkgjgd
"Question about tips [VA] [VA] My wife runs a small floral design company in Northern Virginia with fewer than 15 employees. She deals mainly in high end weddings and corporate events.

She has a core team of 5 full-time, salaried employees for planning and production and she brings in freelancers as hourly contractors for day-of design, set-up, break down, etc. Everyone is paid above minimum wage.

Occasionally, her clients will tip following their event. These tips range from $50 up to $1200 dollars. There's no expectation or convention on tipping - some clients do it, others don't.

My wife was telling me that she takes the tips and adds them to a pot along with other misc cash income (for example, from selling off used vases, etc). At the end of the year, this pot is used to throw a Christmas party for her core crew and freelancers, for an end of the season spa day for her core crew and then as year-end bonuses for her core crew.

"Planning violation on flat conversion, affected area on other flat but what is my liability as joint freeholder London, England

I am leaseholder with share of freehold of a maisonette which the previous owner converted from a townhouse.

As part of this conversion the planning stipulated that the front driveway was converted to a garden with turf and fence/wall. This was not done and we have owned the property for 6y.

At the turn of the year we got a visit from council planning dept saying that this work needed to be done as it was in violation. As the planning was against the original house it is against the freehold so I am supposedly part liable, however the land in question is wholly under their lease.

The landlady downstairs has made some attempts to solve this, but is stalling and going slowly and the council is now threatening an enforcement notice. She's also not being greatly communicative in the last couple of months.

My issue is that I'm not sure what I can do. The front drive is not my lease, so I can't unilaterally do the work. I also can't solely appeal (which I think we should do as the land is wholly inappropriate for a garden and rented gardens usually are very poorly maintained. There is also no space for the tenant to store any required tools). It's also not clear whether I have a financial liability. My lease stipulates that we share liability for structural issues, but this is non structural, however it is against the freehold.

"Is this fraud or something else illegal? (OH) I want to look into this before giving advice to my kid.  

At his school, there are a group of students who are making money in a way that I am concerned is potentially illegal, and want to know what kind of exposure he may face as a result of knowing about what's going on.  A group of students are making discord servers for popular games, getting people into the server, and then start charging for people to get various rights on the server.  Then, once they have cleared enough money, they close down the server and pop a new one up to rinse and repeat the process.  Basically, they are using the fact that people will shell out some cash for ""power"" on the server, and once the process dries up, they move on to another server.  I am light on specifics, but I would assume that this is all happening with some kind of online transactions.

He told me about this going on over the weekend, and my first thought is that while this is certainly unethical (and something that could get them kicked out of school), I am unsure if it is illegal or just really shitty.  So far, my advice was to just take it to his advisory at the school to let the school know about what is happening (as they are pretty serious about ethics, and him knowing about it without doing anything could even get him kicked out if the whole thing comes out), but I am really wondering if this also falls into some type of fraud due to the intent of the students to pop up these servers only to get the money and run.  And if it is illegal, would him not doing anything make him a possible accessory or anything that I need to be concerned about.

"NYS DMV License Points Questions I have a couple questions regarding the following statement (questions are at the bottom). I live in NYC and I’m 24 years old. 


“Once 18 months have passed from the violation date, the points for that violation no longer count toward your total. However, the points remain on your driving record as long as the conviction remains on your record and may be used by your insurance company to increase premiums.” - quoted from the NYS DMV website. 


Q1. Assuming the above statement is true, if I receive a conviction for 6 points 24 months after the violation, would i technically have to disclose that I have 6 points on my license if a potential employer asked how many points I have on my license, seeing as it surpassed the 18 months since the violation date?

Q2. Say I am issued various violations which add up to 20 points in 2016 alone, but my conviction dates are between 2018-2019 for all of them, and I am found guilty for all 20 points. Since it has been greater than 18 months since the violation date, but not 18 months since the conviction date, would I still have 20 points on my license?

Q3. Would potential employers view my ticket history as not receiving a ticket in 3 years, since last ticket was in 2016. Or, would they view my history as just convicted of a lot of tickets in the past 1-2 years, since conviction was 2018-2019?

"Tenant just ate his words In California. We have a tenant renting my house for two years (lease ends on Nov 3). On Oct 3, the tenant texted us, asking to extend the lease to late Nov, in his own words:
“I was about to contact you - we would like to vacate 15 days later by November 18th... given our new home is not fully ready. Can we start viewing from next weekend please”
And immediately we replied:
“Thanks for letting us know. We will just prorate in this case.”
Knowing the move out date is postponed by 2 weeks, we also okay’ed his request to postpone viewing by one week, and scheduled a few prospective tenants in next few weeks according to this new dates he gave us.
Today (Oct 20) the tenant texted us:
“We plan to move the weekend Nov 2-3. Will give keys Nov 4 Monday.”
This is totally unexpected and we told him if there is no one who can start on Nov 4 we still have to charge the prorated amount to cover the gap between the date he moves out and the date someone who moves in (if before Nov 18) or the date agreed upon (Nov 18).
I have a few questions and need some advice:
1) Is the text message (the tenant made a request and we approved the very request) considered “legally binding”?
2) The tenant argued he did not reply to the message to confirm after we told him about the “prorate”, therefore we are still on the Nov 3 star. He also claimed he did not want to pay us the prorate so he didn’t answer. Does this make sense and can he do that legally?

"[WA] Going through divorce, questions for separating without house abandonment. My wife and I own a house and are divorcing. We live in the same house. As of tonight, I will be staying at a friend's place to allow us both emotional space (things have been ambiguous and painful for matters like dinner, hearing each other, going out, etc.). We do not have kids. I pay 100% of the mortgage payments. She does not work. We have not yet filed for divorce.

We wanted to start the petition only after she found a job and felt more confident in her abilities to pay for housing, have insurance through her company instead of through me, etc.  I wanted to respect that and give her time.

2-3 weeks ago, she told me that she cannot move out to an apartment or other housing because it would be ""house abandonment"" and she would be giving away her rights to her equity in the house. She said she was told this during a free consultation with an attorney.

I do not want her to be chained to this house, especially since she gets very sad here. However, we are reaching a point where we are both suffering here as we transition toward separate lives (ex. I come home late from dancing, being with friends, etc.).

Questions

1. If I stay over at my friend's place, is there a risk of losing my stake in our house -- for example, if I were to stay for a week, or a month, or multiple months? 
2. If one of us seeks out an apartment, applies, and moves into it, would this constitute house abandonment?
3. Does the petition date make a difference?

"Please help. Police corruption. Hello all,

Thank you in advance for reading and responses. 

Yesterday my fiance and I decided to take a trip to half moon bay to visit her dad and her sister and her sisters newborn baby in San Mateo CA. I was like roughly  4 hours away. When we were almost there, we got in an argument that got sligntly out of hand. I admit I was being a huge asshole verbally, but I would never lay hands on her I am very much against that. Well this argument occured in very slow traffic (about 1 mph) and lasted about an hour. A few people called the police but someone told them that they saw me hitting her (which I never did). The cops show up, they talk to her and harass me, I'm telling them I never hit her and I would never hit her I was just being an asshole verbally. I show them a video I took of her trying to take my phone from me and damage it. They talk to her and she said I never ever have laid hands on her and basically the same thing, I would never hit a women I was just being an asshole. Well they took me to the station, interrogated me for about an hour and I kept telling them the truth, I would never hit her. They then took me to jail for a Felony Domestic Violence charge and my fiance even begged them not to because I didnt do anything wrong. Is this illegal? Can I sue them or report them to the FBI's corruption division? They really put both of us thru a lot of unnecessary emotional distress and I had to post a $25,000 bail which I cannot afford.

"[NM] My parents were pulled over by police with no probable cause. My stepfather is currently detained because of two IDs. My mother and stepfather were questioned by police after they pulled over, in my vehicle, to use the restroom. They were coming from Albuquerque to Las Cruces to give me back my car and my dog. 

The officer showed up behind them after they stopped. My step father was arrested because he had two ids. One with the name on his birth certificate and one that is currently his legal name. The officers pulled them over for no reason and obtained the IDs after searching through his wallet. They said they couldn't verify the IDs were real. 

The officers let my mother go after questioning if she was a US citizen, which they both are. She asked the officer if she could drive it back to me but he did not let her. 

My car is now impounded because they couldnt verify who's it was. I only found out after my mother called me. They left her in the middle of nowhere, along with my dog, and I had to go pick her up.

"(MD) My health insurance wants me to fill out a subrogation agreement and injury questionaire for my son's broken arm. What's going to happen when I tell them it happened at school? I'll preface this with saying I've had a lot of trouble with my insurance in the past, which has made me wary about everything they do.

&amp;#x200B;

I received a letter from my insurance company denying the claim from my son's orthopedist pending return of requested information and a signed suberogation agreement. It includes questions like ""What type of Illness/Injury"" "" Where did this happen "" Other parties involved"" and a discription of what happened. 

During recess at his public school, my son fractured his arm playing chase on the playground. He tripped (probably on his new shoes) and fell on the blacktop. I've been on this playground, it's well kept, the pavement is in good condition, no potholes or large cracks. I honestly never even considered the idea that the school had been negligent or anything until I got this letter, and after doing some reading on the subject, my unprofessional opinion is that the school doesn't seem liable. This is my only child, if I had throught the school was in the wrong, I'd have said something! Kids trip, running kids trip hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: 

* Will the insurance company go after the school? I'm going to have to have a relationship with these people for the next 6 years, I'd really rather it not start out this way. 
* Should I contact the school at all? 
* Am I making this out to be a bigger deal than it is?

We rented a place together but quickly found it to be unlivable (black mold), however our landlord wouldn't respond to our messages. We would go weeks without a reply, then they'd show up without notice to collect rent (weeks late) and possibly fix something.

We tried to find subletters but we're unable to because our landlord wouldn't respond to us. In the end we told the landlord we were leaving, and headed out. We never heard from them again. This was roughly 4 months into a 12 month lease.

"Ontario, Canada: can landlord or original tenant evict me if I have a pet? So I subletted a room for the school term, and initially my cat was supposed to stay at home with my family. So I didn’t mention a cat living on the premises when I subletted the place. However, it’s becoming hard living apart because my cat and I are very attached, so I want to bring him to live with me. (I’ve done it before but the sublet agreement then said pets are allowed.) 

Are there any legal consequences that can arise from this? There are no “no pets” clauses in my sublet agreement with the original tenant and from what I know, landlords can’t discriminate against pet owners. I know if the pet causes excessive odour, noise etc., then the landlord has grounds to evict but I don’t think that’ll be an issue with my cat. 

On that note, in the future do I need to disclose that there will be a pet living on the premises prior to renting? I was talking to somebody and they said that even though they’re not supposed to discriminate, landlords will just find a different renter without telling you the actual reason.

"Planning on Posting a Video Review of Terrible Rental Complex **Background:**

I recently moved from a luxury rental complex in South Florida. We had lived there for two years. About a year in, a new company bought the complex and began major renovations. It started with the community facilities and pools, and then they began renovating the apartments themselves. They immediately hiked up the rent $500 to anyone who wanted to renew. In our building of about 8 apartments, six tenants moved out within the span of three months. They began construction immediately and it was..loud. Like wall-shaking loud. 

The construction devastated my health and caused migraines and vertigo. I was sleep-deprived constantly. My husband worked night shift and needed to sleep during the day, we were in hell.

They frequently started earlier than 7AM and went later than 5PM. This included breaking titles which broke the legal sound barrier limit. Despite numerous complaints from us, they continued heavy construction. We finally negotiated a termination of our lease (which wasn't supposed to be up for another six months.) And scrambled to find another apartment which we finally did and moved out last week.

**Now for my question:** 

I have nearly 30 video clips (timestamped) as well as series of ridiculous emails between myself, their local management team and their corporate office that makes me them look like the villains they are. I want to make a review video and post about the realities of my experience with their management and construction--warning future tenants not to lease with these people.

  
Are there any legal repercussions to an honest review of this nature on a well-followed YouTube channel? As well as cross-posted on Yelp and other review sites? I'm currently with a private renter now and will most likely buy a house after this (will never rent or live in an apartment again if it can be helped.)

"[WI] My dog bit me, if I need to see a doctor, what can I expect by the way of law enforcement involvement, etc? TLDR upfront: my dog bit me when trying to cut his nails. He has had a fear of having his nails clipped since a puppy when he was hospitalized and the vet let an assistant cut his nails improperly, causing him to bleed on multiple nails. Would law enforcement be involved if I visit a doctor? If so, how? I have a fear of LEOs from childhood trauma and want to brace myself. Please let me know if there is a better sub for this. 

As a puppy, my dog had to be hospitalized for a day for what turned out to be growing pains. He was in puppy school at the time  and we were training on nail cutting so we were instructed not to cut their nails until we had worked through the acclimation. The vet decided to train their new assistant using my dog and she cut the nails way too short which caused them to bleed. They had to use something to pack into his nails to stop the bleeding, it was so bad. He has been fearful ever since. 

As he has become elderly, this has been more and more scary for him as his vision gets worse. I have worked all his life on training, and this was better for years, but in recent months I have had to use a muzzle. He slipped his muzzle last night and snarled at me, which resulted it a puncture wound. Normally he is the sweetest thing, this isn’t normal. He was being defensive. 

My dog will be turning 14 soon, and his siblings from the same litter (This litter was a rescue and a few of my friends adopted from it) have passed a couple years ago. I have been bracing myself for the inevitable since then. I’m not worried about putting him down as I know that is something that will have to be done as his arthritis and vision issues progress. This incident tells me that his time is near because he must have been in pain to do this. His arthritis has been getting worse. 

Now, I’m looking to brace myself for what may happen if I need to see a doctor from this bite. I have a fear of law enforcement from being sexually assaulted by an officer when I was young. I get unreasonably nervous whenever I see an officer. Just the other day I was driving home from work when a light turned yellow a few car lengths before the crosswalk, I saw the light turn red just before I passed under it, and my heart began to race as I noticed blue lights in my periphery (turned out to be a car with blue LED around the headlights). I was worried I might get pulled over. I even pulled into a parking lot to calm down before driving again. I was only a mile from home. I know this isn’t healthy and I recently started  therapy to work through my anxiety. 

What I’m really asking here is what sort of contact I will have with law enforcement about this. My dog’s rabies shot and city license expired two months ago and I decided not to renew given he hates the vet and he likely has little time to live (I plan on in home euthanasia because of this). He also is to the point where he does his business right outside the door and wants to come back in immediately. He still plays inside but shows no interest in the five mile walks we went on when he was a puppy and adolescent.

"Class action lawsuit over a car accident? Hello, (23/F) GA, U.S.A
So at the beginning of May I was involved in a car accident that was my fault. I was taking a left onto a busy road and there was a blind spot.  The speed limit is fast for the road making it harder to predict when cars are coming. I did not see them at all. I ended up side swiping a car as I was turning while going about 15-20 mph. Not fast, but they over corrected hard in shock and spun out of control hitting (and in some cases totalling) 7 other cars.

I was borrowing my step-dad's car during this accident. 
It was a horrific accident. I was in complete shock at the scene and probably seemed emotionless/apathetic. Damage to my car was minimal. A headlight and a new front bumper were needed. It was drivable after. The impact itself was hardly felt by me. 

My step father recieved a letter that a class action lawsuit is being filed against us. There is insurance on the car and there was at the time of the accident.

The letter was vague. I am not sure what to expect from this and am terrified. Neither my step-dad or my mother make much money or have paid-for assets. I myself am a college student and make on average 8-12k a year. Neither of my parents have money saved for retirement and will likely work their entire lives. 
To my knowledge no one reported any injuries at the scene. Though I know they still may have afterward.

"Dog Court - Dog Defending Against Another Dog I live in Washington State. My dog is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier/Bullmastiff mix (aka, not a pitbull. He is a bully breed, though.) my boyfriend took him outside to potty and they were headed back inside, with my dog on the leash. A woman with a cattle dog was walking down the sidewalk, when her dog saw my dog. Her dog became aggressive and lunged forward. My dog attempted to defend himself, by grabbing the back of the dog’s neck and holding him there to avoid being bitten. Her dog got a light bite on my dog’s wrist, but her dog did not sustain any injuries. Another passerby had to come take control of her dog, as her dog was going wild and knocked her off her feet after the dogs were seperated. She told a 911 operator twice, as well as an animal control officer both dogs were leashed, and she did not wish to persue. Two days later, however, I’m issued a potentially dangerous dog notice and am told she wishes to persue because she claims my dog was off leash. The notice I was given has an incorrect breed that was not confirmed with me, my boyfriend’s name as they did not confirm with us who the actual owner is, no description of my dog or a microchip number despite asking me if he was microchipped (he is), and no case number. I am planning on appealing it, but I need advice on what to bring and if this notice is even considered complete, due to missing information. I am bringing photographs of him with another dog playing, a photograph of him focusing on me with another dog in the background, statements from a Petco groomer I bring him to regularly, a statement from a trainer who has been working with us for a year, as well as documentation of his injury and a statement from his vet. I also have confirmation I purchased a license for him. Am I missing anything? Will this even fully go to court with the missing/incorrect information, as well as her story changing two days later?

"What to do with the vehicle of a deceased relative? [California] My father passed away recently, and the only real property he left behind was his work van. We are unsure how to handle it because of several problems:

1. We cannot find the title!
2. It has over $2,000 in late registrations fees. My dad was a courier, and so he had to register his van as a commercial vehicle. Several years back he developed a rare disease in his leg which prevented him from working. He apparently paid the registration for at least a year after that, but didn't change the registration type. His condition worsened and the van was neglected for several years. The registration fees stacked up quickly.
3. The van has some minor issues; the main obstacle is that it is a Sprinter van, and the parts are expensively imported from Mercedes. 

We are not sure the best way to proceed given the circumstances. Ideally, we would like the keep the van, although we do not have much cash on hand. It would be nice to get the fees reduced somehow.

My questions are:

1. Is there any protocol for waiving fees in a case like this where the owner became disabled and was unable to drive; let alone work?
2. What is involved in taking over the ownership of a deceased relative's vehicle? 
3. How do we proceed without a copy of the title?

They put up a new sign saying they were regulating that lot yesterday (didn't see the sign as it is posted on a tree and wasn't looking for it) , and booted my car last night after I got home at 10 pm in the newly signed lot. They didn't inform us (the tenants) of the new regulations and am unsure if I have any legal recourse or if I'm just stuck paying them to take the boot off my car.

Mostly my question hinges on them not informing us of the new regulations and enforcing parking they hadn't told us they would enforce.

Basically, her mother took her inheritance (Around 40,000 USD) that she got from her father that past away many years ago.
Her mother, for the most part, seemed to have used the money for random items and services (such as renting a recording studio/equipment), the reason for this is most likely because she suffers from mental illness so she has the habit of being very spontaneous.

"Dentist is charging me for services that weren't covered by insurance, after telling me they would be. Location: Asheville, NC

I recently moved to a new town. In search of a new dentist I called a practice near my new home. They asked me for my insurance details, confirmed I was covered and ""in-network"". We scheduled my fist appointment.

I arrived a few weeks later and handed them my ID and insurance card. They confirmed, once again, that I was covered and led me to the back to begin my examination.

About 20 minutes later, I'm in the midst of getting my initial dental x-rays done, when the practice admin (the same one who took my initial phone call, and also confirmed my details upon arrival) comes in and apologizes, they had made a mistake, I was not in-fact covered.

They asked me what I'd like to do, and I explained I couldn't afford to pay out-of-pocket, and so we agreed to end the appointment early and I would leave.

A few weeks later, I get a bill from them in the mail for ~200$. I assumed this was in error, and called to confirm. Once again, that same practice admin answered, apologized and told me it would be taken care of.

A month later (just a few days ago now), that very same practice admin calls me, and now explains that I would be responsible for the ~200$ and if I don't pay, they will send me to collections.

Now it is possible that I had sped up to 5-10km above the limit. However my Speedo is about 5km off aswell ( tested with a Speedo ). 

The police car at the time followed me about 150 metres and tailgating me with no siren or lights and after I turn the corner he then pulled me over. 

I was completely shocked as I had no idea what i was being pulled over and then he hits me with some bullshit number saying 30-40km over. I asked him did he get that on the radar ? He said no, it was an observation. I said I definitely wasn't going that fast and perhaps it seemed that way because he has just taken off from the lights and I went past him making it seem like that.  He then said that I was questioning his intelligence and that I flew past him doing 30-40 I'm over. He said I was doing 100 which was absolutely false.

"Questions about visitation and contempt of court motion Throwaway because I don't want these questions to be associated with my regular account.

State of North Carolina. 

I have a lawyer but he is vague and non-commital in explaining what is likely to happen in court.  I'm hoping you all can tell me how courts typically respond to certain issues. 

Background: I'm a grandmother with legal visitation with my 5-year-old grandson, who I will refer to as A. A lived with me for 2 full years as a kinship care placement, but two years ago I lost custody to his father who previously had not been involved in his life. His father, I'll call him B, lives about 6 hours away, in South Carolina, and I am court-ordered to meet him half-way at 6:00 pm every other Friday and Sunday. When A visits, I am required to supervise his visitations with his mother, who is my daughter. To be clear: I have legal visitation in my own right, as NC law allows for grandparent visitation under a narrow set of circumstances, which I met.  I also have full custody of A’s half-sister whose father is dead.

A was conceived when B cheated on his long-term girlfriend, who I will call C, with my daughter. C did not know about A's existence until DSS subpoenaed B for a DNA test; B knew about A and knew that it was possible he was the father, but he chose not to act on it, presumably to maintain his relationship with C. My sense is that now B&amp;C would like to just be a nuclear family with A and leave my daughter and me out of the equation. C has two other kids from two previous marriages who also live with them.

Over the past two years, B&amp;C have increasingly encroached on our visitation time using various excuses, like that their work schedule interfered with the drop-off so we have to meet later on Friday. Or that 6:00 on Sunday is too late too meet because A needs to be in bed by 8:00 so we need to meet at 4:00 instead. Or that C's other kids have some activity that they need to attend to so other arrangements have to be made. You get the picture. I have generally been quite flexible because I just wanted to keep things civil, but the more I gave, the more they pushed, and on Easter weekend when they told me that we had to meet at 11:00 on Sunday because they had planned a family Easter dinner, I pushed back. It didn't go well. In the end, they relented, but only after I threatened to take them back to court to enforce the order. 

Then, over the summer, they went MIA, and would not respond to any of my texts or phone calls. We missed multiple visitations because of their ""disappearance."" My lawyer sent a letter threatening to file a motion for contempt, and the following week B sent me a ""we haven't heard from you in a while - what's going on?"" text. I calmly told them that I didn't appreciate their disappearance, but they pretended that they hadn't gotten any of my previous texts or voicemails (their phone numbers had not changed). They said that A had been sick and could not visit that week so it took another full week (and missed visitation) before they finally agreed to meet for the next scheduled date, and even then, they cut our time short by needing to meet at 7:30 on Friday and 4:00 on Sunday. I didn't argue because I knew we would soon be back in court.

So my questions:

1. Is the judge likely to see through their claim of not receiving my texts and voicemails when they ""disappeared""? The fact that they reappeared only a week after my lawyer sent the letter makes it seem especially obvious to me that they are lying, but is a judge likely to agree?
2. If the judge does agree, how likely is it that he or she will find them in contempt of court, and maybe order them to reimburse my legal fees? Or is it more likely that the judge will just order them to follow the court order in the future?
3. B&amp;C constantly come up with reasons why A's visitations are bad for him, and they frequently claim that he has come home sick or injured. It's all complete bullshit. At one point they claimed that he came home with lice, even though no one at our house had it. They’ve also made claims about colds and bruises. Today they told my husband that Jacob always gets in trouble at school for hitting his classmates after our visitations; they want to know what's going on at our house that makes him violent upon his return. There is nothing bad going on at our house (we don't spank him); we always have a ton of fun with him, and he probably just has trouble with transitioning back. They nonetheless insist that it must be something we are doing wrong. But a judge will see through their attempts to demonize us, right? 
4. B&amp;C tell A to call C ""Mommy."" When A is at our house, I always refer to C by her actual name and A has told them that. At one point B asked me not to do that ""given everything C has      done for A."" I told him nope, that my daughter (as messed up as she is) is ""Mommy"" and C is not, and I will not refer to C as Mommy when talking to A. My guess is that the judge won't touch this issue either way. Am I correct about that?
5. Altogether, A has missed 6 visitations with us due to their game-playing. The court order says that those visits are supposed to be made up, but every time I've tried to schedule makeup visits, I've been      rebuffed. Is the judge likely to force them to make up the time? If so, is it more likely to be added to the summer, or as back-to-back weekends? Will I have any say about my preference? 

I know that there are no guarantees as to what the judge will do, but I am interested in knowing what I may reasonably expect. As I said, I've asked my lawyer, but he never gives me any straight answers. I trust him and have faith in his abilities (he's been good in the past), but his vague answers here are making me crazy.

About a month ago I received tickets from the Santa Clara county Sheriff's department for driving with an expired registration and an expired license. It was not suspended.

I got a ticket and he told me he was making the court date in november so that I could have time to get my license so they would dismiss the case (if you renew your license and show the judge they basically just dismiss the expired license charge).

I have a physical copy of the ticket but there's absolutely no record of the infraction or court date online. I've tried just going by my name, my driver's license, the case number, and the infraction number.

I also went through every case in the month of november and I have no court date at any point that month.

I thought maybe that the sheriff's citations went through their site instead of the county court site, but there is no place to search for traffic infractions on the sheriff's site.

The cop was very nice to me and I could see him not actually filing the ticket, but that's never actually happened to me before and I don't want this spiraling out of control just because I think the ticket doesn't exist.

Is there a way I can absolutely be sure this ticket wasn't filed and that I absolutely have no court case? I basically used ever possible way to search for it on their website and it doesn't exist. Do I need to go to a courthouse and have them confirm it in person?",legaladvice,t3_dktj51

My mother, who I still live with, made a counseling appointment without my permission or knowledge. She said at the time that it was free for *some* amount of visits, but in fact that particular counselor was not covered under our insurance. Blindly trusting her, I went along with it. 

I now have to pay about $300(2 visits) worth of counseling bills and have no way to pay it. I don't even have access to the insurance's online portal or my login details, *she* does. She herself admits she screwed up but refused to pay it or do anything. Our health insurance provider basically gave me the middle finger when I attempted to tell them the situation.

The counselor knew that I didn't make the appointment yet still ran with it. Throughout the two sessions(second I made because I thought it was free) I was then insulted by said counselor as he tried to insinuate that I was mentally insane.

"My sister's abusive x boyfriend is squatting in her house and won't leave. I live in the state of Idaho. My sister dated a contractor for about 4 months. He seemed like a good dude at first, I met him and honestly got along with him pretty well right off the bat. He moved into her apartment with her because they got along well and their relationship was going good. Things changed very quickly however, and she started seeing a side of him that wasn't apparent at all before. He started accusing her of sleeping around on him while she was at family functions or even just running to the grocery store. He began following her places and showing pretty classic signs of an abusive significant other. He physically and emotionally abused her. She asked him to leave her apartment and he refused, stating because he had his mail sent there now he was a legal tenant. She broke up with him, and they had a falling out. I went to her apartment with her, helped her box up his stuff, and called him. I had him come get his belongings, walk through the apartment and make sure nothing was left of his, and then walked him out of the apartment.

"Worker's Rights in MA? There's a lot of little parts to this situation, but at the moment my biggest frustration is that my current company (employee of about 4 months) has been making it very difficult for me to get any time off to recoup. I have brought it to their attention that Massachusetts law dictates a Day of Rest for every 6 days worked. The company has employees like me traveling 80+% of the time on back-to-back 2-3 day trips (which, in my view, was misrepresented to me during the interview/hiring process, e.g. they stated I would always have travel days as stand-alone days, and they have gradually had me fly/drive same day as work days more and more until now that's all I do), in addition to weekends that we are supposed to be able to take off so long as we've worked 1 weekend during the month (also misrepresented), and without real lunchbreaks. I have worked 2 weekends this month, with no weekday breaks between, for a total of 13 days of work, and they were giving me a hard time about taking next weekend off. I reached out to HR and they agreed that I should have some days off this week to compensate. and told me over the phone that they were concerned about the 6 days issue, plus the lack of lunchbreaks.  


As of a few days ago, they took me off of a trip so I could get a break in, only for me to see today that my ""break"" is still working in the office, just not traveling. At this point, I have a hard time believing they aren't being willfully harmful, as I have been stating my discomfort with driving while exhausted, having no true lunchbreaks, and my need for days off for my mental/physical health.

I am acitvely seeking outside employment at this point, but while I am still here, what is the best route I can take in dealing with this going forward? I understand Mass has their [Mass.gov](https://Mass.gov) workplace complaint section, but I don't know if I should speak to a lawyer first, etc?

Fast forward to this weekend I had about an hour to pack and I rushed to empty the bag and throw stuff in it. I guess I didn't check the pockets as thoroughly as I should have. Today I was flying home to my small city from Vancouver. My bag gets flagged and I am asked if I have anything in it. I tell them I don't think I do and start to go over what might be in there in my head. They ask if I have any guns or magazines in my bag that I haven't declared and I tell them that, to my knowledge, I don't. They then pull the clip out of the side pocket. I immediately realize what it is and where it came from and I feel so stupid. I tell them exactly what happened and they start asking me questions. At this point there are about 4 agents and 3 RCMP officers. They ask me if I have my PAL, I don't but under Canadian law I can hunt with my parent who has a valid PAL as long as they are next to me the whole time. They then search my bag and my laptop case for anything else and find nothing. They confiscated the clip and ammunition and I boarded my plane after being patted down. The parent with the PAL wasn't traveling with me at the time and I unknowingly had the clip in my backpack. I will also mention that I am a minor.

"Writing a glassdoor review for a company, but concerned about defamation Greetings to the Lawyers of Reddit!

So a couple years ago, I had one of the worst interviews of my life. I'm very experienced with interviewing and take my own professionalism very seriously, and I'm also not usually the type to hold grudges... but this interview was so unbelievably unfair and unprofessional that I feel compelled to write about my experience on Glassdoor. However, before I could post, I found Glassdoor's page explaining defamation and I admit that it was difficult for me to comprehend. My understanding is that Glassdoor will protect people whose reviews are sued for defamation, but only to a certain extent? IMO, it makes more sense to just write a review that I can't be sued for to begin with, which is my goal. I'm also concerned because the CEO of the company that I'm writing about is literally a psycho and I wouldn't put it past him to try to find out who I am and sue me. However, I can't seem to drop this. I think the whole point of Glassdoor is to bring transparency to the nasty treatment employers dish out on applicants, and it's important to call it out. In fact, I also believe that racism might be involved, which is also why I want to post.

With this said, I was wondering if anyone would be willing to spend a few minutes to explain defamation in accordance to this [Glassdoor article](https://help.glassdoor.com/article/Tips-on-writing-a-review-to-avoid-defamation/en_US/), in layman's terms? I read it through a few times, but I'm having a hard time making the distinctions. Or ideally, I already wrote my review - before posting about it on Reddit, I considered perhaps hiring a lawyer to proofread it before I post it. Is this something I could potentially contact a lawyer about? I have never hired a lawyer for anything before however and my knowledge on how to proceed in this situation is extremely limited, so any advice would be most appreciated.

"Out of state subpoena - victim in criminal case (WA / MD) TLDR: The State of WA vs Person. Superior Court of WA for King County. Vehicular Assault criminal case. Drunk guy drove through my fence years ago. State of WA says I'm a victim and emailed me a subpoena. I disagree with what they are trying to charge him with. I have moved to MD and was supposed to leave the country a few months ago. Can I get out of this?

I received a subpoena for the Superior Court of WA for King County. The plaintiff is The State of Washington. The defendant is a person. The charge is Vehicular Assault. I believe it's a criminal case.

Late one night a few years ago, I was pulling out of my driveway (in front of my house) with a friend and I heard a car crash. I drove around the corner and saw someone had flipped their car up on it's side behind my house. The car was smoking, so I called 911 and stayed back. My passenger and a neighbor helped the driver (who had gotten his head stuck in the door frame and was hanging by his neck inside the car). I stayed on the line with the 911 operator until the police and an ambulance arrived. We left to get my car out of the way and because we had no info to provide. I never saw the person in the car, but my friend was pretty sure he was dead. The next morning, I came home to find a giant hole where my back fence used to be and one of my trees had been hit and was covered with oil. No idea how neither of us noticed it the night before. A friend helped me replace my fence and remove the tree (which needed to be done anyway). My neighbors who also had damage said the driver was drunk and didn't have insurance or a license. They also mentioned that they had some people sleeping in a tent in their yard that night and they could have been killed, but luckily they weren't hit and were totally fine. They also said they stole cigarettes from the guy's car and went through his stuff... classy, eh? I never spoke to the police or anyone else about the incident.

Fast forward to this year (it's been two or three now.. I'm not sure): I sold my house and am temporarily staying with family on the other side of the country getting ready to go travel for the next few years. I have legally changed my address to Maryland. I start getting letters forwarded here stating that I will be receiving a subpoena because I'm a victim in a court case. I call the contact-person listed on the papers. She says I can't do a video deposition, but they'll cover travel and accommodation expenses. She asks if I know how to contact the people who were hurt while sleeping in the tent in the accident. I explain that as far as I know, no one was hurt and I don't have any contact info for my old neighbors. I continue to receive letters, now stating that a new date has been set and I'm still under obligation of the original subpoena that I never received. I reach out again and she emails me a subpoena. The court date has changed a few times and I'm having trouble continuing to put off my overseas travel plans now. I can't tell them anything other than that a car hit my fence and tree. For various reasons, this is starting to cause me a great deal of problems because I was supposed to leave the country months ago. I have no problem helping get a drunk, uninsured, unlicensed driver convicted, but I don't feel that I have any information that would help the state's case. If anything, I disagree with the charge.

Is it weird that no one has ever asked me a single question about that night, but I've been listed as a victim and subpoenaed? Is this subpoena enforceable? Is it possible to get out of this? Thanks for any insight you can provide.",legaladvice,t3_dkvouj
"I was told to “remain neutral and not pick a side” while I was shuffled into a room for a photo op with the mayor. Hey y’all, so I live in Chicago and if you may know there is a teacher strike going on. Currently I attend university and Im doing my student teaching - think of it like an internship except for teachers. Because of the strike my uni told me I would need to attend a community organization in lieu of my regular placement since there are no students and I would be working with kids that weren’t in school. I was fine with this because I was still fulfilling the amount of hours needed to graduate. 

Well, I show up to the community organization and I saw a news truck but didn’t think much of it. Come to find out that the mayor would be dropping by in an hour to do a photo shoot with a bunch of the kids. Cameras start showing up and walking around the hallways then they shuffle us into a room where the mayor was going to come and read a story to the children. Meanwhile, I was texting my university supervisor asking what to do and she said I was to not “pick a side” but remain neutral. This bugged me because I felt that by putting me in a room where the mayor was going to take a photo op they were essentially using me as a token. I exited the room once the mayor got there because I didn’t agree with the whole thing. Either way I guess my question is did I have my first amendment rights violated? I don’t really want to pursue any legal action but I’m genuinely curious if by my publicly funded university planting me in a room with the mayor during a strike and telling me to remain neutral and not pick a side is a violation of the first amendment.

"Company sending invoice for much more than agreed sale price. Earlier this year, I made a purchase on a company's online store. The item was on sale for $169.99, normal price $439.99. I had been on the fence about making a purchase for this, and finally decided that with that sale price I could justify it. I made the purchase using their online store, and used PayPal for the payment. Purchased for the sale price. Got confirmation that the order processed, and about a week later I received the item I purchased in the mail. As far as I could tell, everything was fine.   


Fast forward to a full two months later. I receive an email from a representative of the company saying that the original payment failed from PayPal and that that I owe them the money for the item. They attach an invoice and are trying to get me to pay the $439.99 price. I would absolutely not have purchased the item for that amount. I then check my PayPal account and see that I had a pending payment for the company in the original sale amount that said it was waiting on the company to accept it.   


I've been back and forth with PayPal and this company a few times now and so far the basic summary of the situation is that, PayPal says they never received any requests to pay the larger $439.99 amount they only ever got one for the sale price amount. The company is refusing to acknowledge that the item was on sale, or any possible fault on their end for not accepting the original payment or invoicing me for the much higher price. The real kicker here is that the exact same item I purchased from them is *still* on sale on their online store to this very day for the sale price.   


To be absolutely transparent, they currently *have not been paid* anything because they declined to accept the original payment I authorized. I am not looking to get away without paying, I would gladly pay them the sale price that I agreed to when I purchased, but I'm not pleased to be effectively extorted for 2.5 times the price I agreed to so I have not given in to their requests that I pay them that higher amount.  


So I guess the reason I'm here is to ask... what options to I have for combating them on this? How much to I really need to worry about them pressuring making a payment I never agreed to. Is there a specific area of law that I should look into for this issue? Any particular kinds of representation I would have to seek? I realize that in the grand scheme of things roughly $300 is not of money to be fighting over given legal fees and the time involved in combating them but I'm just so irked on principle alone about this whole mess.

"Roommate’s Leftover Stuff/Identity Theft (?) Hi Reddit. I have two problems with my roommate I could use help figuring out. I live in Washington state. 

Problem 1:
My apartment lease is ending next month. I have gotten all of my belongings out of the apartment, but my roommate still has a lot of random things left there. He told me three different dates of when he was going to pick it up so we could hire a cleaner, but the stuff is still there. I tried contacting him multiple times recently to see when he’ll have it out, but he is ignoring my texts and leaving me on read. I talked to the apartment today and they said to over communicate with him saying if he doesn’t have his stuff out by X date, then I’ll throw everything out so the apartment can be cleaned. The issues I have with this are that I don’t know if he’ll legally come after me later because I got rid of his stuff, and I’m not physically capable of moving the rest out and would have to pay someone to take it away. The apartment also said that we would both be held legally responsible for any leftover items/ the condition of the apartment. I’m also afraid I’ll have to clean it all by myself when he left a huge mess in his room and bathroom or I’ll have to hire someone and pay for it all myself. 

I feel my options are to either pay someone to take his junk and hire cleaners (or clean by myself), or leave everything and have the apartment charge us both so at least I’m not paying everything out of my own pocket. Even with this option, I’m afraid if I pay my half, he won’t pay his and the apartment could go after us both. I also don’t know how much they’d charge us. 

Problem 2:
I found out that the same roommate stole my SSN (I’m assuming from our lease when we applied for the apartment) and opened a utility account in my name. I have since shut it down, but am worried of what else he’ll do with that information and don’t know what to do going forward.",legaladvice,t3_dkst1l

However through out the year of my tenant seem I had problem after problem after problem but I did not break my lease I paid my rent every month and I'm stayed there the whole year. I gave her written 60 day notice to vacate which was required. I had no balance due at the time of move out and there were no damages to the unit. I cleaned the unit and turned my keys in before the last day of the month. So basically everything that I was supposed to do.

So I received the deposit and the glider of deductions after the 30 days if she was required to get it to me and I had to contact her several more times to get her to send it to me by the middle of that following month. When I got in I was being charged $100 late fee for the last six months in a road that I was there. However she never once notified me to let me know that my rent was late because it wasn't and it was also dropped off in the drop box at the office and she lives in New Jersey so her assistant picks it up. I have text from the assistant sometimes saying that she's picked up rent but hasn't deposit it and has been holding on to it. So my question is can she charge me late fees for 6 months in a row without ever notifying me to let me know that my rent was late? She lives in New Jersey and we drop the checks in the Box in New Orleans that are assistant picks up and has admitted several times on text that she's gotten the check she just hadn't made it to the bank to cash them. So does she have to notify me if my rent is late or can she just say I was late without ever notifying me throughout the last six months of my lease and take it out of my security deposit? Also if the deposit and the letter of Damages did not come in the 30 days required but showed up 45 days late is she in Fault for that?,legaladvice,t3_dkv2do

"I was assaulted(I think) last week and the police want to speak to me. I'm 15 and live in Ireland and the main thing I want to know is if I'm allowed to speak to the police alone without my parents or if I'm allowed to avoid talking to them and just write down what happened. It happened during school lunch and I'm allowed downtown for lunch.

 A boy had wanted to fight me and I was very reluctant to fight from the start and everyone knew this. A lot of people had heard there was going to be a fight and I was scared there would as I'm in transition year which is only in Ireland I think and it cost nearly €1000 for the whole thing and my parents would kill me if I got kicked out over a fight so other than simply having no motifs or dislike for the boy I didn't want to do it. A lot of people who wanted the fight said they'd drag me over to him if I didn't go to the boy so I reluctantly did and it became clear he didn't want to fight because of the amount of people around who probably would've rathered I won not because I'm overly popular but because he's hated because he's always fighting. I got to where he was and I stood there while he was talking shit and was saying ""come at me"" I'm which I didn't but put my fists up thinking he'd eventually back out under pressure in which he didn't. 

We walked around in a circle and had no intention of fighting unless I was absolutely forced to as walking away was never an option. We had basically walked a small circle and my best friend came in trying to defuse the situation and I thought it would work and told me not to do anything. My hands dropped down by my side and I was listening to him try to tell me to walk away which wouldn't work but it calmed me and next thing the lad punches me in the face completely unexpected(I drift away and typically struggle to concentrate and having a fight seemed unlikely so I wasn't expecting anything) and he lunges at me grabbing me and he's trying to pull me while I grabbed him and I fell/he pushed me and I smashed my head head off a wall and he punched me in the eye. My friend called an ambulance and the police came too. I later got 5 stitches.

"Tenant is creating a hostile work environment I sublet an office in my office building and have had to start the eviction process due to him always paying rent late.

At this point he became verbally (via text and email) aggressive, litigious, and querulous and has progressively become more so. This month he was late again and I gave him the 3 day pay or quit notice, which he paid in the allowed time. I have a notice to quit for repeat violation prepared for next month if he is late. 

Now he makes aggressive and querulous complaints about almost anything that I do at the office. This weekend is was because I turned off one light (of the four that were on) in the common areas, and I was accused of interfering with his business and threatening the safety of his clients.

"[GA] I wish to evict my tenant Posting this with a throw-away account.

I desire to rid myself of a tenant.  I own the house, I'm renting a single bedroom to a young man who also works for my employer.

I handed him a lease agreement based on a various lease agreements found online.  It mentions a 30-day notice period for termination, but I think that should actually be 60 days in the state of Georgia.  There is a clause stating that no language in the lease shall supersede any law should the language of the lease be found to conflict with the law.  Any such section shall be amended to comply with the law.  Notably (and regrettably) absent from this lease agreement: Criminal Activity clauses, Smoking clauses.  While I did discuss the matter of smoking with him (I would have none of it indoors), I didn't see it necessary to discuss anything about illegal drugs (I've got nothing against people smoking weed, but I would prefer not to open my property to the risk of forfeiture).

Also absent from this lease agreement: either of our signatures.  He never reviewed it, nor did he sign it, nor did he hand it to me for further review or co-signing.  I presumed that he intended to go over this with me after getting settled in (stupid of me, I know).  He has, however, promptly paid for each of the two months he has resided here, but he's shorting me $50 each month per what I originally wrote on the lease which I handed him.

I believe that, legally, he is a ""tenant-at-will,"" and I very much no longer will to retain his occupancy.  I wish to terminate his occupancy for the following reasons:  Smoking indoors, bringing illegal drugs onto the property.

Do I have a legal leg to stand on?  If he should spitefully damage my property after handing him is eviction notice, what legal mechanism would enable me to recover those damages?",legaladvice,t3_dkurv8

The lugs are completely destroyed and my lugnuts were nowhere to be seen. Since the brake service, my wheels have not been touched by anyone.

"Sublessee Filed Chargeback on Rent Payments Using My Leasing Account, Debt Collectors After Me Hello all.

About a year ago I had to move out of my apartment on short notice. I scrambled to find someone who I could sublease to. Fortunately, it didn't take me long to find someone who was willing to take up my offer. I found this guy on Facebook - he was a current student at the same university I was going to, and he seemed like a nice guy. My impression of him only improved after meeting him and his family in person. After showing him the apartment he agreed to move in. 

Per the terms of my lease, subleasing was allowed only with written consent from the landlord. I talked with management (landlord) and they consented verbally, saying they didn't care as long as rent was being paid. I knew many other students who lived in the complex were doing the same, and in desperation to cover my rent and my ignorance as a first-time renter, I went ahead and had him move in without drafting any paperwork. No contract between he and I and no written consent from management, nothing. 

Anyhow, my sublessee was a good tenant and there were no major problems with his stay. He always paid rent in full and on time, and he seemed to be enjoying himself when I came to visit my other former roommates. I thought my crisis was averted; that is, until debt collectors started calling me a few months ago on behalf of management. They claimed that I owed them upwards of $2,500 (rent + interest). It was not a scam call. 

Thankfully, I didn't agree to pay anything, but I was baffled. I visited the office the next day to figure out why they sent debt collectors after me.

Apparently, my sublessee filed chargebacks on two rent payments. I had no idea why he'd do this, how he was able to get those approved, or how it was even possible for him to file chargebacks on payments *I made with my account* in the first place. Then I realized what had happened. 

The first few months, I had him send me the rent money and I'd use my account to make the payment. But 3 months in, he asked for my account information (not bank, but leasing portal) so he could make the payments on his own. For what, I didn't know, but I trusted him and gave him my username and password. Second mistake... 

Management was wholly sympathetic to my cause, as it seemed like he was scheming from their point of view, but they said their hands were tied. 

I called him multiple times but he never picked up. I sent him a text explaining the situation in the most non-accusatory way possible and asked him if we could talk soon. Still no response. 

My sublessee was a likeable guy, but having spent a good deal of time around him I could totally see him doing this just to keep some extra money in his pocket. He's a cheapskate in the worst way possible, like Mr. Krabs level cheap. I wouldn't think much his penny-pinching ways if that was what he needed to do to get by, but ~~he~~ his family is very wealthy. What's more, his lifestyle choices - the Benz he drives, the parties he goes to, the rent he pays - are funded entirely by his parents. 

So yeah, *maybe* he had a good reason for filing those chargebacks, but I highly doubt it. All I know is I'm on the hook for this.

I've learned many important lessons in having to deal with this situation, but I can't help but feel like a total idiot. Never in my life have I been finessed this hard. In any case, I need advice, which is why I came to this sub: 

1) Why have the debt collectors stopped calling me? I'm still on the hook for this, no? 

2) Can I fight this? Does what my sublessee did - using my account credentials to make payments to file chargebacks to get the money back - is this fraud? Identity theft? 

3) I'm just barely recovering from homelessness, I can't afford to pay this. What can I do if I'm forced to pay up?",legaladvice,t3_dkup3q

"Guy threatening me, what can I do? Hey, 18M here in Washington State. This is gonna be a long one.  
About a month and a half ago, I got into a fight with a guy when he hit his girlfriend (girl 1). No charges from that, so no worries there. However, his girlfriend is now dating that guy's friend, and I'm very close with the girl's sister (girl 2). I went with girl 2 to see her little brothers and girl 1's new boyfriend decided to talk to me. He heard a rumour that me and my friend beat up the first guy, and said if he found out there was a second person there, he'd beat me and wouldn't stop until I stopped breathing, because 2 on 1 isn't ""fair"". Yesterday, at girl 2's baby shower, we got into a discussion about whether or not the new iPhone was any good (he buys a lot of expensive things because he thinks it makes him better than people, and he thinks if it costs more it's always better) and when I pulled up the hardware specs, he got mad because I showed him that the cameras aren't that great, the ram is sad, etc. And started threatening to beat my ass.

I sent him a text after the baby shower telling him not to threaten me again unless he had the guts to follow through, because he hasn't so far. He replied with, and I quote, ""Next time i see you I'ma fuck you up stay in your lane broke bitch your a fucking retard and pedophile talk shit get smoke next time I see you I'm throwing hands an I won't give a fuck whos your around.""

Basically he called me broke because I have a OnePlus instead of an iPhone, and threatened me again. This was followed by several more threats.

On the thread, someone was posting fully-clothed selfies from my Instagram, that I posted when I was 14-16. 

My friend and I did some digging, and we got the kik of the poster. I posed as my ex and messaged him trying to find out who he was. I sent him one of my own lewds to further the idea that I wasn’t actually myself and he asked for more pics. I just deleted kik and forgot about it. 

Yesterday, the same username added me on snapchat, and messaged me my own lewd asking if it was me. He tried to lie and say someone random sent it to him, and I called him out and told him it was really me who kiked him. Then I essentially manipulated him into telling me who he was, by telling him I was SO flattered he found me attractive, lol.

I put down the first two letters of my name before I realized they were going to bill it as an outpatient hospital service so I stopped signing because my insurance doesn't cover hospital.

"Phone company charged $4 dollars monthly for 15 years for a service that was never applied to my account. (PA/USA) I have had a home phone account with this company since 1995. I was curious about a $4 monthly service charge on my statements so I called to have it explained. 

Upon calling, I was told it was to keep my number out of the directory. I never requested this service so I tried to figure out how long it's been on my bill. The supervisor I spoke to said they couldn't find a service request for when it started and while checking, they found out that the service has never been applied to my account and my number has always been listed in the directory. 

That means I've been paying for a service I wasn't even receiving. It appears to be on my bill since I opened the account which would be 15 years ago, give or take a couple of months. Added up, that's about $1100.  

The rep only had access to my past billing until July 2018, where the charge still appears up until this month so they offered me a $60 credit for 15 months of the service. I told them if they could email me copies of the first bill it appears on and the one before that (without the charge) then I would consider their offer. I did not receive an email or the proof I requested but instead had a $60 credit added to my account for the next month. I have contacted them and told them to remove the credit and that I did not consent to that amount.

I'm speaking with a finance team manager tomorrow because I was told they are the only people who can credit such a large sum.

My question is if they decide not to give the money back or work out some sort of credit deal, what legal options do I have?",legaladvice,t3_dku4ad

"[CANADA] Should I fight my speeding ticket? (officer told me he is being nice and reduced the offense, so if I fight it I am scared of going back to my original offense) Basically, this happened in Canada, Ontario.

I was driving in a rural area around 1am after dropping my girlfriend off (First time driving in this place when I got caught). I was very tired and wasn't paying attention to my speed and just so tired and wanted to get home as soon as possible. 

The road I got caught in is a big road, very dark at night and feels like a highway. I was driving in an 80 km/hr ( 50 mph) zone and an officer pulled me over telling me I was going around 130km/hr. (111 mph). Basically telling me I was going over 50+ km/hr, which is considered stunt driving. The officer told me that he could suspend my license and tow my vehicle for this but he said he won't. Instead will decrease my offense to 30-49km/h over the posted speed limit. Which is 4 demerit points and 350$ fine. 

Should I fight this ticket? I'm afraid that if I try to fight this ticket and lose, the offense my go back to 'stunt' driving and would suspend my license in return.

"Stepdad stole my inheritance My mother died in 2015 without a will. When her retirement paid out, my stepfather took it and put it in a savings account to be split three ways between me and my two siblings ""for the future"" meaning to be used for a house down payment, schooling costs, etc. Verbal agreement only. Recently he has decided to cut ties with us, and I've found out that he's spent all the money in the account. Currently I do not know who the listed beneficiaries on the retirement account were - I will obviously be getting this information before making any kind of decision on moving forward. Obviously if my siblings and I were not named as the beneficiaries, there is nothing to pursue here and it's just good riddance to bad rubbish having this guy out of my life. Also he's changed his story as to my mother's wishes, and he's now claimed that she told him to cut me out.

In the event that my siblings and I were the named beneficiaries, I would like to be made whole. However I know that he would not be able to make repayment (short of selling the house that he and my mother bought together that he currently lives in). He is not very good about reliably holding down a job, either. The amount is right at the cut-off amount for small claims court in the state where he lives - I assume this matter would be best handled in small claims court, or is it a criminal matter? What is the likelihood of me/us actually getting made whole if he has no assets and no savings other than the house and its contents? He lives in Texas.

"What should I discuss during consultation Just wanting to start getting realistic when I see a divorce attorney for consultation. I currently live in Louisiana with my husband but plan to move back to Alabama. I plan on divorcing my husband of 5 years (together for 8) within 6 months due to multiple times he has cheated (proof of all times cheated with me). No kids but we are doing a debt consolidation and in the middle of paying all that off and my car that is in both of our names but is a “gift” to me several years ago that is paid off. 
He has always made great money as a welder working outside of the state while I was at home working jobs making just above minimum wage due to helping my parents with my disabled brother. So I have almost always relied on his help for essentials. 
He has cheated on me twice this year (if you don’t count the dating profile he made two years ago that I found with the other stuff from the beginning of the year). First towards the beginning of the year and the second time three days before our fifth year anniversary. I have all of the proof in a separate email that he doesn’t know about. 
He has opened credit cards in my name without me knowing and maxxed it out. Then wouldn’t pay it. But I don’t have proof that he was the one who did it because he applied for them online. That’s what the debt consolidation was for. 
I’m about to take a job that makes twice what I used to so that should help me out. I have a separate bank account from way before we met each other that he has never even deposited in, let alone made joint. But I want to make sure that I have my other ducks in a row before I get a uhaul and get my stuff. 
I will be “lawyer shopping” later this month and want to use my “free consultation” wisely. I know I have one time to talk to them and after that it costs money. So what should I bring to the consultation? What should I bring up that would be relevant to the divorce? How low are my odds of getting alimony even for a year? What should I ask them? What should I see as a red flag for a lawyer? How many lawyers should I talk to before picking one? What other advice do you have for me??

"Does landlord have the right to evict for using garage outlet to charge EV? For starters, my girlfriend and I both live in southern California, you can start to see here how ubiquitous EVs are starting to become but some areas still have little to no access to public areas. One of our deal breakers when we went apartment hunting was the inability to charge her  car. We read the entire terms of agreement on our lease and know it makes no explicit statement about use of the private garage outlets. We even asked our landlord if it was OK to use it for EV charging and was verbally given the go ahead so we of course signed in. A year passes and our lease is due for renewal, they do their required inspection of the apartment and garage to which they find everything within agreement until they noticed the little basic 120v slow charger plugged in. We were shocked to hear from the report that the charger should be removed and that we are due to another reinsepection. She relies on that station to arrive to and from work everyday since there aren't any reasonably placed public charger near us to take advantage from. Are they within and should we find a new place?

"Boss wants to deduct money shortage from my pay in Florida Okay, so I'm a shift lead at a pizza shop in the state of Florida. Last night, I was closing manager,  and while counting out money  and closing the system I came out with cash over what the system said we should have had. I counted it thrice. 

Okay, so I just took part of it and threw that in the bank bag we use for instore tips, that we divide amongst the managers and instore employees every week. The other part I just left in the deposit so it said we were about 40 bucks over. 

This morning my boss sends me a pic of the printed daily operating report. Under the cash over for the day part, it says ""Team member shortage $148"" and then below that, it says ""Total Cash Short $106"" 

Now, maybe this was a fuck up where a driver's money owed to the store wasn't saved when they clocked out, I don't know, honestly, I clocked out the majority of the drivers, and I saved payments, what they owed the store at the end of their shift, like we have to do, but the opening manager may have clocked out a driver as well and took their money owed. We also had another instore employee, whose been training to be a shift lead, and all 3 of us all well as some of the drivers used the till to cash out carryout orders. So pretty much every Tom, Dick, and Harry had access to all of the money, and could have screwed up somewhere when cashing out orders. 


I'm sorry if this is kind of jumbled, I'm hella confused myself and I apologize for not making this coherent from the get go. 

This store already doesn't have the best money practices. The safe is not used at all. We only have one working till/cash register, and all of the store cash is kept in that drawer. At the end of the night the deposit is just put into a bank bag and into a cabinet in the office that has a lock on it, but the lock is very rarely, if ever, used. 

When I was counting the deposit out and counting store cash and driver banks (the money delivery drivers start their shift with), I did not see the team member shortage or the total cash short numbers. 

I only saw the cash over bit, because that's the part I have to copy down in the book we use every day to record that, total net sales, labor cost, food cost, plus out the door times, and customer service compliance numbers. 

I just woke up to the texts my GM sent and a voicemail with her saying ""I didn't work yesterday, I'm not paying for this, this is on you, opening manager, and instore employee."" 

So my question is, will it be legal for my employer to dock our pay for this amount we are apparently short by? I've googled this question, and I think for FL it says as long as it doesn't knock the employee down to below minimum wage, they can, whether we sign an agreement for it or not. Is this true? 


I'm also really confused as to how one number is saying we were over, but this other number is saying it's short.

She see's the neighbors girlfriend coming outside so she tries to have a civil conversation to smooth things over. GF is as agro as the BF.

I'm watching all of this from our landing above. Agro BF comes outside. Personal space becomes an issue very quickly, before I can fully understand what's going on, Agro BF is saying my wife pepper sprayed him.

Obviously after that both parties called the cops. I tell my wife, when stuff like this happens someone usually ends up in cuffs, good chance its going to be you, just be chill about it.

"Car towed due to employers mistake, what now? Hi everyone, I’m having one hell of a time trying to figure out my next steps.

Background: 

I work for a small local coffee/tea shop in Arizona that does not have much parking around our building. When I was hired about a month ago (and all other employees were told this) I was told to park about 2 blocks away in a shopping centers parking lot. The owner of the entire company, all of my coworkers, and myself all park there for every shift. Some of the girls I work with have received flack from the property manager for parking there because there is a high school adjacent to the parking area, and he thought they were high schoolers parking there. Other than that, there hasn’t been any issues. The owner of the company had even said that if we ever run into any issues with the property manager, to call her directly and that she would sort it out herself. 

Thursday I went in for my shift at 7:30am and parked in my usual spot. I got off at 1pm and my car was gone. I immediately knew it had been towed. I called my manager and explained the situation and sent her a photo of where I had parked, and also contacted the towing company. I get a call back from my boss saying that the area we had all been parking in was not correct, and that everyone had been “assuming the risk” by parking there. Management said that it would be MY responsibility to pay for the tow, even though every other employee that works there (including the owner) parks there. The cost is $117 and I know they can afford to pay it, but are choosing not to. My coworkers are all on my side and are very upset for me. I make minimum wage and I’m only scheduled 1 day a week, there’s no way in hell I can pay for this, and that was even mentioned to management by a seasoned employee. 

I emailed management yesterday asking about reconciliation and how I could be reimbursed for this since my car is STILL impounded. No response. I even offered to have the amount garnished over a few paychecks.

My question is, how do I proceed? Do I get an attorney involved? Do I go to the police? Quite frankly, I’m at a complete loss on what to do next. I can not afford this at all, cannot take out a loan, and do not have anyone I know that would help me out. I’m considering quitting at this point because I feel like I’m being made into an example and that my employer is trying to wipe their hands of the situation. However, I don’t have another source of income at the moment. I absolutely hate confrontation and this whole situation has been a nightmare for me.

"Tenant wont admit to damages and is threatening to take me to court if I repair with security deposit Hi guys, in need of advice here. From Hawaii, I have a duplex with a garage parking for rent and my tenants just moved out. The garage is shared between the two floors, the first floor tenants have the left side of the garage while the upstairs tenants have the right side of the garage. I noticed after the move out inspection that there was damage to my first floor tenants side of the garage door (left side) that could have only appeared from their car running into it. I sent them a detailed message regarding it and said i'll be using the deposit to pay for the damages and they'll get the remainder if there is any. They replied and claimed that it might be my neighbors that hit my garage door since they use my driveway to back out. They also said that they'll take me to court if I use their deposit for repairs. I'm not sure what to do as I've never been in this situation before. 

*I have pictures of my property from before move in date and def shows no damage

*I have a text from him admitting to scratches inside the garage but not hitting the garage door itself

*My lease prior to move in date has all prior damage listed, just nothing about the garage (didnt think this would happen)

*I had no idea that the security deposit from tenant had to be in a separate bank account so its in my personal bank account, will this affect me negatively?

What can I do in this situation? I can't 100% prove that it was them who damaged my garage door as the garage is shared. Although the damage was on their side of the garage. Also im worried that I didn't have a separate account for the security deposit. Should I just return the security deposit and eat the cost of the repair? Or am i entitled to the security deposit for the repair. Please help, am a bit lost

Back in May a college friend of mine had to return to China for a family ""thing"" that he wouldn't elaborate on. I agreed to store his car for the summer as until he returned for the Fall semester.

"Reclaiming Excess Fees Paid to ""Public Officials"" from Used Vehicle Purchase I purchased my first car yesterday, a used vehicle, in Los Angeles County.

This was separate from a small emissions and a documentation fee. I have reason to believe that this 'estimate' was a much higher fee than what was actually necessary.

"PA - Next door neighbor's tree fell down on another neighbors shed, do I have any liability? We and our next door neighbors share a privacy fence along the rear of our properties. About 1-2 feet inside their property line, there was an old tall Douglass Fir that was dead and rotting for awhile. They recently had a tree company in to repair another tree on their property, but the company told them the fir was ""stable"". Turns out that wasn't quite true.

Last week we had crazy high winds. The tree fell down on the privacy fence, and on to another neighbor's shed.

That shed owning neighbor paid my wife and I a visit yesterday to see if we knew whose tree it was. We have a surveyor's map from 2007 showing the tree is on our next door neighbor's property, but just barely. The map was from when the previous homeowners were having a carport added to what is now our home. So we showed them the map we had. They asked for a copy and told us that their insurance company would still be contacting us and the neighbors on Monday since the agent wasn't sure where the property boundary was.

We are going to run off copies of the map on monday to provide them.

My only concern here - are we potentially responsible for any branches that hung over the property line on to our property? I've attached part of the map to show what I mean. There really weren't any branches left but I am just trying to understand if there is any way this could be twisted into putting some liability on us.

My big concern is that there's a good chance that the next door neighbor's insurance wont cover it if the tree was rotting, so I could see this becoming a nasty issue very quickly and people grabbing for straws to find money.

Edit:
Here is the section of the surveyor's map in question.

"Own a home and let my freeloading friend stay with me until they get back on their feet. Refused to pay rent for almost a year and has been an overall nuisance, how do I go about evicting? I live in Pennsylvania and my friend was in a bad situation and needed to get back on their feet. I own a home and have a spare room so I offered for them to stay with me until they get back in their feet. We had agreed on 200$ a month but didn't put it in writing (I know it was stupid, hindsight is 20/20). Right before moving in, they quit their job. The first couple months they said they couldn't pay so we told them to do what they could for the time being. Apparently that was nothing, in fact, we (my husband and I) had to even pay for their groceries. I did this because we had an almost 10 year friendship and they were coming out of a bad situation. 

I ended up helping them get a job where I work and rent still never came for 11 months. There was a constant back and forth about just paying something because we needed to cover the increase in utilities. Nothing came of it. During this time, they were rude to my husband and I, would not do their dishes, would not take out their trash, and treated my home like a hotel with a maid service. I was expected to wake them up when they were late, and take their trash out because ""it's all going to the same place anyway."" I realize I should have evicted them then but I didn't want them out on their asses in the middle of winter. 

They finally started paying rent last January. It wasn't the full amount but it was something. Fast forward to last July, we told them we need them to move out in the near future because we would be starting to move on with our lives and wanted to start a family. They said they would need until the end of August to get some money together and look at places. We agreed.

 They quit their job in the beginning of August and said they needed until the end of September because they would be starting a new job. They got the job and are now FINALLY paying full rent. However mid September came and went and they said they were going to be out by mid October. It's now mid October. Last week, my husband asked which day they were planning on moving multiple times. They ignoring him until Thursday when they said they weren't planning on leaving. We tried to set a date for this weekend and made clear we want this to end amicably.

"Stuck in Lease Extension So I’m a tenant in NYC who just purchased a new place with my wife. The process was arduous and took 6 weeks longer than our original lease. I discussed options with my landlord, and he said we needed to sign for an additional year but gave us a rider that would allow us to terminate one month late. At the time, we had cleared our interview with the co-op and expected to close one week into the new month. What we didn’t anticipate was the seller holding off until the very last day our offer was good for before closing. The one month extension we were given is now essentially worthless, but I recognize the situation.

The landlord will not give any additional months saying it is more difficult to rent after October and the only way out of the lease is if someone else begins renting. I get his view and it seems fair. We have made ample efforts to ensure the apartment is presentable and needs almost no work done to transition over.

Last year when we got into this apartment, the broker claimed that the landlord would work with us if we were planning to buy and arrange month to month, but don’t expect to see it in the lease contract (yeah... I feel stupid for missing the red flag). When I looked online, I only saw the apartment listed on one property app and nowhere else. Last month I also checked and saw it on multiple locations, meaning some were deliberately taken down. We feel the broker isn’t making enough effort to bring new people in and want to help, but we aren’t allowed to list anywhere.

It wouldn’t make sense for the broker to not help since he isn’t making money off of sitting on it, but he is very close with this landlord, and something feels off. We have done everything we can to make a seamless transition, but the landlord doesn’t mind since he is getting paid regardless.

"Want to take custody of my nephew. Need help/advice! I made a throwaway because I don't want anyone I know IRL to potentially see this.

I live in PA with my fiance, my mom lives in Ohio. She has raised my nephew since he was a baby. He's more like a little brother to me than my nephew. The problem is, the man she's married to (my step dad) is a toxic, abusive, oppressive POS, and he shares custody with my mom. They've been married for over 15 years.

I've been trying for years to facilitate a divorce between them, but the nature of abusive relationships and abusers makes that very difficult. It includes holding my nephew over my mom's head, and the threat that she can't leave without losing him. He doesn't deserve that. My stepdad has literally never said ""I love you"" to this kid, but wants to use him as a bargaining chip to force my mom to stay. Or for a tax break.

I want to get him out of there so he can salvage at least somewhat of a healthy childhood. My stepdad curses him out on a daily basis, constantly compares him to the father he's never known (my brother, and he is not like him), and has now convinced him he is bipolar and mentally ill. Trust me when I say this is classic projection. My stepdad is tragically the only father he's had.

He's 14. I've looked it up and his preference will be considered in a legal setting, but won't make the final decision. My mom is willing to consent to granting me custody, but think it will be a fight with my step-dad. 

Is there anyone who might be able to point me in the right direction?

I've never done something like this before, and don't even know where to start. Is it going to be a pricy, lengthy process? Will I need to do anything in particular to ""prove"" I will be a responsible guardian? Is there actually anything my stepdad could do to deny me custody, even though he's abusive? 

One more concern I have: I didn't have a great childhood either. And I almost got lost in the foster system when my own dad tried to force taking custody. I don't want that to happen to my nephew. I want to do this the right way.

"Can I do anything about being disinherited? It is a long story on unequal distribution. My Dad is a self-made man who became a CEO of a major Fortune 500 company. He is now in his 90s. I was raised in wealth but always treated differently, and even as a child there were many times he told me he didn't like me. I felt like an unwanted foster child.

I decided to take some time off from college when he cut me off. Five years later struggling to pay bills and put myself through college I contacted the family. My mother had died and my Dad remarried a much younger woman and they had 2 children. He agreed to help me with living expenses but not my tuition. I was grateful and it helped a lot. Fast forward to the time when I wanted to go the graduate school: he would not help. Nevertheless, over the years, he has helped me out from time to time and helped me buy a car.

I am on disability now and recently ran into some financial trouble when the owner of my apartment building sold the building and we all have to move. Rents are skyrocketing in my area. I approached my Dad and he said he would not help. He also said ""I am not a rich man.""

I turned to the internet and found out recently more about his assets. He owns 2 homes paid in full, one worth $1.6 million and last year sold a vacation condo for 3 million cash. Two weeks after the sale of the condo one of my step sisters who has no visible resources bought as 700,000k home. He has at least 1 mil in a stock portfolio and in retirement gets over 100k a year. His total net worth is well above 6 million.

My Dad made it clear to me upon his death everything will go to his second wife who I haven't spoken with in 10 years. The sale of the condo and the extra house shows up as an assset for my other step sister. He also fully funded their private school college tuitions including master's degrees at colleges where the tuition is $50,000.00 a year.

It hurts. I know I was always disliked, and least favoured. But I always thought he would provide some token amount for me. He is aware of my situation and that it is desperate. He just doesn't care. When I tried to talk to him about the whole situation, he became verbally abusive.

So about a week ago I came into work and it was pretty slow at the front desk. My direct supervisor was there, she really likes to gossip and get into people's business, very nosy. Supervisor says ""Omg OP, did you hear about what happened with daycare lady?!"" I said no and my supervisor proceeded to tell me that the daycare lady just found out her toddler son has pinworms. If you don't know what those are, look them up. In short they are parasitical little worms that once you ingest the eggs they hatch and live in your intestine/colon area. They take a couple weeks to grow and once they do they  start to um.. crawl out of places. (Just look it up if you want to know more) They apparently spread fairly easily, especially with kids. Anyways, so day care lady's son has grown pinworms. Then supervisor tells me that the pinworms spread to daycare lady and her daughter.

 I obviously was freaking out because ew, but here is where I need legal advice. Our bosses (there's two) asked everyone if any of us could work in day care. They didn't mention the pinworms and after I talked to the rest of the staff in the building, I realized no one else knew about it at all. My supervisor said the bosses considered saying something to everyone and posting a notice on the door for customers to see when they walked in so everyone would be aware but they decided against it because they didn't want to scare everyone off. Is that legal? Are they allowed to offer a day care service and not inform paying customers who are parents with small children about a pinworm outbreak? Are they allowed to trick staff into working day care without telling us that there was pinworms?

They found out about it on a Friday, I heard about it the next Monday evening and by that point no one had cleaned the room yet. No one volunteered to cover the day care shift and they were pretty mad about it.

tldr: Coworker who works daycare and her kids got pinworms, it's likely they've contaminated the workplace. Management is trying to keep it a secret from customers and staff and they are trying to get me and other staff to work daycare without informing anyone of the pinworms.",legaladvice,t3_dkkc8c
"Massage membership cancellation: my location closed suddenly, can another franchisee charge my card? I’ve had a monthly membership with a massage franchise for a while, and I’m a member in good standin. A couple of weeks ago I received an email that the location was closed effective that day. Apparently the owners went bankrupt and closed shop suddenly. 

The email gave the contact of another location (different owner) who would be handling memberships and appointments going forward. I don’t want to continue my membership, so I’ve contacted them about canceling. They said they can’t process my cancellation right now because they’re still waiting for the transfer of member information from the closed location. They also said I will have to pay my upcoming charge with their cancellation policies. 

Normally I’d be fine with this, but it seems wrong to pay a cancellation fee when the entity I’d authorized my credit card either and had a membership with no longer exists.

"A company gave my business data to a client without consent. Can I sue? I run a marketing consulting agency based in Texas that purchases ad inventory from another ad agency based in the US. I then resell this inventory to my consulting clients based in Sweden.

One of my clients contacted the ad agency that my consultancy uses (they figured out who I used) and requested data from my business account relating to their website. The ad agency gave them impression data and the financial costs that my company incurred for those impressions. This was done without my consent.

I previously wrote to them by email that nobody should be able to access my account except myself and my company. I was told no one would be able to access my account except myself under any circumstance. Also from their privacy and data policy on their website this is made clear as well that data will never be given to third-parties. My client is not a part of my company and the account is under my own company name. However my clients website name is listed in my clients section of my account. Secondly, I had requested over 2 weeks ago, before the data was sent to my customer, that my account be deleted and this was never done, however by email they confirmed it would be done. The reason for deletion is because I was moving to another agency.

After my client received the data including the costs I incurred (I mark up the prices) they decided to terminate their relationship with my company and purchase direct from the ad agency. This was a client for over 5 years, my largest client, and has ruined my company.

Am I able to sue the ad agency and reach a financial settlement of some kind? I'm not sure if there is a type of lawyer who takes these kind of cases on a pro bono basis and keeps a percent of the settlement.

Their actions have ruined my business financially and I'm not sure what will happen with me personally because of this. My company will be forced to close. Further, is what they have done illegal? Perhaps against US or GDPR data laws? I am a US company and they sent the data to Europe.

"Halloween Hypothetical We live in a HOA community that attracts hundreds of children on Halloween. We have private security, road closures and such to make this a safe place for children, as a lot of neighborhoods around here aren’t great (gun crime). We take it seriously and usually have 300 trick or treaters.

I have two questions:

1. If a person is standing on the front sidewalk, which is on HOA property, but scared by one of the ‘jump scares’ on our property and fall, are we partially liable for any injury? 

2. We have a small sidewalk that leads to a porch with steps. On the porch will be an animatronic decoration, which a lot of people over the years like to take selfies with (corpse bride that talks to you). Along the path are jump scares (skeleton that crawls out of a bush, for example). If someone is on our property, startled by a ‘jump scare’ and falls, do we have liability? Can this be limited by a small sign or verbal warning about things jumping out at them?

"Are retired drug dogs legal? So I am living in an apartment complex in Texas and I smoke weed, that's the basis of this story. So as you would expect when you smoke in an apartment you have to be very careful. Well for quite a while I wasn't as careful as I should be I suppose. I would smoke out on the porch and Ash on the sidewalk. So the penalty of this is, a neighbor who himself is a retired police officer, owns a retired drug dog. He walks this dog by often and one day the dog sits and won't move this being the signal for drugs. We thing the dog is just being stubborn but the neighbor says this and says someone must have dropped something there. He then says he's not gonna say anything that's he's cool and won't tell on us, admitting he knows it's me and my buddy. Well we feel some relief but still shook and not believing him totally. A week later we then get a letter from management saying a drug dog in the complex has sniffed an illicit substance coming from the patio.

"My Dad Just Barely Got SSI ￼So I know this is sort of a long shot. But here goes. 

My father (51M) is completely disabled, physically as in he cant walk properly most of the time, cant sit for too long and cant stand for too long. He also has a variety of mental health issues, such as SEVERE anxiety and depression (he's attempted suicide twice) and he cant even go into a grocery store that he's not used to without a panic attack. He's been fighting for SSI since 2011, he has been rejected several times, and lived with me for about two years until financially I could no longer care for him. He also has COPD and has been hospitalized a few times for this and pneumonia along with MRSA a couple times. The MRSA has cleared up btw. 

Moving on, he has been approved for SSI as of last year. They granted him a small back pay portion of $2500 USD, and $408 per month. He was supposed to get further back pay of about $19,000 give or take. The state, (Oregon) is taking $6,000 for back child support for my older sister (aged 33) and the rest is going to restitution for the state based on an assault charge that my dad had in 2005 or so (if it matters, the next door neighbor was creepy and my dad confronted him and then he tried to fight my dad. Neighbor got the worst of it so they arrested my dad). They have also decided that they will be taking the $408 per month that my dad gets for SSI. This is his only source of income. 

Currently he is living at my younger sister's ex boyfriend's mom's house (yeah. I know, kind of hard to comprehend) in a janky little trailer that doesnt hold heat well. He hates being there and I wish I had the means to take care of him, but I am struggling to stay afloat myself, for my 6 year old daughter. 

My question is, is there anything legally that we can do for him? I know others around the same age that are getting almost $800 per month for less, such as ankle injuries.

"[NC USA] Will accepting a position at another company impact my EEOC case? I opened an EEOC inquiry against my employer regarding a failure to accommodate a disability.  The claim I have submitted is that the accommodation has been unreasonably denied through inaction.  The employer is a large company with over 1000 employees, so there are dedicated HR avenues.

History (intentionally vague to not identify employer):

I have worked at company since May 2017.  I was diagnosed with a mental disorder in Sept 2018, and began treatment.  This diagnosis did not severely affect my job at the time treatment did improve my work.  I quickly got noticed, and was selected for a test run of a new position in Feb 2019, with the understanding that if the CBA of the position didn’t work out, I’d go back to my old position.  I was provided with a “loaner” laptop from our IT department and a work table (roughly 2.5’x4’) on the production floor.

By March 2019, I realized my diagnosis had the potential to impact the new position, though it had not done so yet.  I decided to disclose my diagnosis to HR, so that it was on record should it ever become a problem.

The CBA was well worth it, and I was chosen to fulfill the position full-time in April 2019.  My duties started to shift as we refined what needed to be done and defined the process.  As the process got streamlined, additional duties got added on.  The position started as 85/15 split between physical activity/administrative work. It slowly progressed, and is now roughly 50/50 between the two.

The physical work is easy to do, and needs no refinement or accommodation.  However, the administrative work requires additional time and mental labor, as I am now evaluating data and refining processes outside of my personal area in order to fulfill the position duty of “prevent unnecessary loss”.

With my mental disorder, organization is extremely important for stress management and combating executive dysfunction.  The work table and loner I was assigned quickly proved to be insufficient for me.  I disclosed my disorder to my boss in June 2019, and requested that my work table be moved off of the production floor.  This request was well within reason for the size of my employer, and would not impact my assigned duties job in a negative sense or impose undue burden.

I continued to follow up with my boss in our 1-on-1 bi-weekly meetings (as I was not in the communication loop), and was constantly told that he was “working on it”.  I received an upgraded laptop (mainly software updates were needed for my administrative work), from a separate request, and was dated temporarily by that as I implemented a few organization techniques that were not able to be done on the old laptop.

In August 2019, I grew impatient.  I followed up, once more, on the desk and reminded my boss that it was an ADA request, and asked if he had spoken with HR, as they may have access to resources he did not.  He informed me at this time he was unaware it was ADA related (despite my specifically explaining my disorder, diagnosis, and that the accommodation would be for that).  He instructed me to go to HR to fulfill proper channels.

No problem, I promptly did so.  They gave me a form to have my doctor fax, along with a letter from the doctor explaining the need and benefit for the accommodation.  I had requested that the workstation be off of the production floor, as parts of the production floor are varying levels of clean room, and as such can’t have certain materials down there that are common in office/organizational supplies.  There are empty desks/workstations in other parts of the buildings that I work in, that are also more central located (my physical work is across several departments in multiple buildings).

My doctor sent it in, I followed up with HR in early September 2019, and received confirmation that was received and was not given a denial.  I had informed HR my boss was already aware, they followed up with him, and told me he “working on it”.

In early October 2019 I followed up with my boss in our meeting and he told me that he had not gotten a reply from Jane (fake name), who is the person who does administrative assignments (such as basic office equipment, desk assignments, etc).  I had also reached out to Jane on my own separately in May 2019, and she directed me to my boss, whom I did speak to when it became a problem.

I have lost my patience.  There are empty desks, there are desks assigned to people who voluntarily left the company months ago that still have things on them, and I have not gotten any actual communication.  I went to the ADA to find out how to file a complaint, the website directed me that ADA employment issues fall under EEOC.  Went and filed with EEOC, did my interview, and EEOC rep determined there was enough to file a charge.

I dove into this job headfirst.  I’ve always had a hard time making work happen, which was answered by my diagnosis.  Once I started treatment, I was determined to turn this new position into a career (it has career prospects in logistics/industrial engineering), and wanted to become the absolute best I could be at it.  The months and months of perceived inaction and perceived procrastination have destroyed that, and before I filed for EEOC, I was looking for other jobs.


Here’s the actual question:  Would accepting a job offer from another employer impact this EEOC charge, and if so, how?  Obviously I won’t need the accommodation if I leave the company, but I feel that the company should be held accountable for mistreatment of those with a mental disability.  If this is how I’ve been handled after being specifically chosen for a role, I can’t imagine how the average employer at my former level is treated with mental disability/disorder.",legaladvice,t3_dkqzgu

"Currently Being Committed Against My Will to Psychiatric Care after Visiting Campus Clincian about Anxiety Medication. Currently in ER, Soon to be Transferred to Inpatient Care where My Phone will be Taken From Me. The last 12 hours have been surreal. I am a college student in Boston, Massachusetts. I have been struggling with general anxiety and depressive symptoms since coming to college. I have taken and continue taking variety of measures including biweekly meeting with an on-campus counselor, group therapy, and self-care tools. 

With midterms, I found my anxiety and depression interfering with my work more I could handle. I have been asking my on campus counselor for a consulation on medication for weeks, but because of how disgustingly overflooded system, she told me I would only be able to see someone in early November (this is when I asked in late September). I ask other resources for help and I am told that seeing an urgent care counselor on campus and expaining how immediately I need to get help with medication can help expediate this process.

Come this Friday afternoon at 5PM, I check-in at urgent care. It takes an hour for the on-call clinician to arrive, and by that time the nurse tells me that another 3-5 people have checked in to see someone.

The urgent care counselor spends no more than 10-15 minutes with me. During this short time, I try to explain literally 2 years of mental health history as well as the nuance of what I was experiencing most recently. When asked if I have ever had suicidal ideation, I tell them I actually do have intrusive thoughts on occasion, but it is usually very easy for me to brush off. I described however that last night I felt compelled to look into reddit threads on r/suicidewatch and r/suicidebereavement. When he asked me to explain more in depth what I had read, I mentioned a thread about a student who had hung themselves with a electrical cord and the perspective of their friends who found them. Reading stories like that help me rationalize how violent and terrible the reality of suicide actually is and makes it a lot easier to see these thoughts as the irrational momentary escapist fantasies they are. I know in my deepest core that while I entertain these suicidal thoughts, I know truly that I would never seriously kill myself.

Unfortunately, this is where things start to completely spiral out of control. This urgent care counselor leaves the room and disappears 
for 20 minutes. When he gets back he informs me he is going to have me take an ambulance to a nearby hospital for emergency evaluation and possible admittance. I tell him this is not something I am comfortable and that it was an extremely unnecessary escalation. (I was also worried since I don’t know how the finances of this works out for me as I am a low income student) He says I have no choice as he is placing me under “Section 12”. After some wait where nothing more is explained to me about Section 12 (I had to google it to actually understand what its meant to do), I am escorted from my campus hospital in an  ambulance with an actual brigade of 5-6 emergency responders and police.

HERE IS MY BIGGEST POINT OF CONCERN. On the way to the hospital for emergency evaluation, I am taking to one of the ER responders trying to just stay composed and take in everything that was happening, she says “Just so this goes easier for my report later. We were told that the campus clinic recieved a call from your dorm last night (meaning Thursday night) where they were informed about you threatening to commit suicide. They mentioned something about the use of electrocution.” I immediately stop her there, I said no that is absolutely not what is happening nor was that what I told my urgent care provider. There was no phone call from my dorm about an attempted suicide. There was no attempted suicide or threat to commit suicide. I cannot understand where this idea of electrocution came from, besides the counselor misconstruing the example with the electrical cord from earlier.

I since have arrived at a local emergency care and spoken to an registration facilitator, ER nurse, and the psychiatrist on duty at this hospital I was transferred to. I tried to explain in more detail the context of everything I had told the counselor who placed me under Section 12. I tell them this initial report about a late night call and electrocution is just completely untrue. She says she will check, continues to ask more questions and eventually tells me I am being placed into impatient psychiatric care, with or without my consent as extension through Section 12.

I ask her more into what this means. I will be in involuntary care from 3 up to 7 days. I will be in a “secured” area with someone checking in on me every 10–5 minutes. My phone will be taken to limited access, but I can write down numbers and make phone calls through a provided phone. Limited visitation hours. I will be given daily counseling with a psychiatrist and medication from there.

It is definitely true that I have issues with anxiety and depression that needs professional help. Help which I have personally sought out and understand is in my best interest. I know how serious and how insidious mental health issues can be, and I feel educated to understand my level of risk where I would know if I needed to voluntarily commit myself for example. I feel I am being made to feel crazy. I cannot comprehend how I am being asked to stay for up to 7 days without consent.

I am at a loss for words how within 6 hours, I have gone from a student needing medication consultation to being stripped of my freedom, my clothes, and contact with the outside world at the word of a counselor who spoke to me for 10 minutes.

I have been contacting my family (who are overseas and cannot help directly) and furiously googling to understand my situation. This passage from Massachusetts Law Section 12 looks relevant.

“Upon admission of a person under the provisions of this subsection, the facility shall inform the person that it shall, upon such person's request, notify the committee for public counsel services of the name and location of the person admitted. Said committee for public counsel services shall forthwith appoint an attorney who shall meet with the person. If the appointed attorney determines that the person voluntarily and knowingly waives the right to be represented, or is presently represented or will be represented by another attorney, the appointed attorney shall so notify said committee for public counsel services, which shall withdraw the appointment.

Any person admitted under the provisions of this subsection, who has reason to believe that such admission is the result of an abuse or misuse of the provisions of this subsection, may request, or request through counsel an emergency hearing in the district court in whose jurisdiction the facility is located, and unless a delay is requested by the person or through counsel, the district court shall hold such hearing on the day the request is filed with the court or not later than the next business day.”

I was not told about my right to attorney. I was not offered chance to defend my ability to refuse admittance.

I am currnetly sitting in ER wing of a local hospital still. I am waiting for a bed at another facility so I may be transferred and begin treatment.

My questions are the following:

How long are they actually allows to keep me for? I have been in emegency care for 8 hours already. I overheard a nurse mention how beds may not even open up till Monday. Will I be waiting this entire weekend through to next week in an ER room with people genuinely screaming and yelling down the hall?

How do I talk to someone about what is going on  with this application of Section 12? I am completely  shocked that this is how little they need to put me in a room with security guards paroling me. By this standard, half the rest of my school and more than half of reddit should be admitted against their will.

"Can you get a restraining order for someone who is harassing your family about you? In short, I'm in North Carolina, and currently there is a lawsuit between my father and his ex. The contents of the lawsuit are detailed and long, but in short, my father is the plantiff and the ex is the defendant. Through a long complicated situation involving my dad's health, my father was eventually forced out of his own house and is now living with me, approximately 2.5 hours away from the original location. Further details on how this had occurred [can be found right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bx9sug/exgirlfriend_trying_to_evict_my_father_who_has/) for those who are curious. There are still further details on this, but that should give enough context to cover the situation.

After these occurrences, multiple things have happened: 

1. She had told my father multiple times that she wants 'beat me up' and fight me, especially because I was gay, and the only thing holding her back is her going to jail. I have at least one instance of this on recording.
2. She has made me the pivot point for her defense. She's effectively claiming that I'm manipulating my dad so I get all of his things. I have proof that she was the one manipulating him originally. My father's first will had about 90% of all he owned going to this ex.
3. She's also decided that she wanted to practice this story with other members of my family, calling at least one family member with this story, lying about both me and my father to try to get her hostile to my family. 
4. She has been trying to use my sister as a way to find my dad's location, whereabouts and such. She is expecting that my father should be dying soon as he was diagnosed with 3-6 months to live in April. However he's recently been told that he may live up to 5 more years

"[VA] My building is currently under construction, converting from radiators to central heat/AC. The construction has been ongoing for about a month and we still don’t have heat. Temperatures have hit 35°F some mornings. Is there anything we can do as tenants? I’m a college student. This is my first time living off campus. My roommate and I live in a 102 year old house that has been converted into 6 apartments. Previously, the apartments used radiators in the winter and window AC units in the summer to moderate temperatures. Apparently, the radiators just got too old and the landlord was told they wouldn’t be able to start up again this winter, so for weeks we’ve been enduring construction (landlord’s handling of which could be a whole other post) to install a central AC system in each apartment. My terminology is probably off here, I know nothing about HVAC or what is really going on in the apartment. 

The important part is, the radiators have been removed but the new heating system still isn’t up and running, meaning we have no heat in our apartment. I don’t want to buy a space heater because I have 2 stupid cats who will probably start a fire, plus they’re expensive and gnarly on the electric bill, but I’m getting tempted due to how cold it’s been lately. The temperature around here dropped pretty starkly from 80s to 60s, with mornings being 35-50°F. It’s chilly. I’ve been wearing gloves while I play video games. My cats have been tucking themselves in to my blankets to keep warm, and one of them still managed to get a cold. I’m sure there’s some VA law that requires landlords to make sure our apartments CAN be heated, but given that she’s installing the system now, is she in the wrong? Is there anything we can do? 

Our landlord also has a history of ignoring us when we raise complaints. She pretty universally sucks.

"I received an anonymous email with incriminating information about a local campaign. Ohio. I was anonymously sent two files, one is a copy of a letter sent by a citizen. The citizen was emailed by the spouse of a local candidate who works at our high school. He used school time and his school email to contact multiple people and ask them to vote for his wife as well as asking if he could place a yard sign in their yard.  He also emailed out his wife’s political Facebook page, discussed dropping off political literature, and discussed campaign strategy regarding knocking on doors and having fundraisers.

It also says they mixed school and personal campaign purchasing by ordering school merchandise and inquiring about the candidates merchandise at the same time.

I have the letter and a copy of the email.

The person who received and reported this copied the school board, superintendent, two town news reporters, two other local reporters, and a state auditor. 

The person who sent it to me said they are afraid it is being buried and asked me to put it on my local political social media page. 

I am afraid to do this because a newspaper has protection and I don’t. Honestly I’m even afraid to ask what to do about it. But I do not want this covered up and there are only two weeks left til the election.

I have had a very difficult time trying to see if it is legal for me to share this. My political social media page is not anonymous.

"Who will get the house I'm currently 19, living with my grandma because I wanted some Independence from my parents even though they're right down the road. My grandpa passed a few years back, so it's just me and her in the house, along with her two dogs. 

The problem is, my family has fallen apart after my grandpa passed. And the debate of who should get the house arose. It's down to me, and my uncle. Everyone thinks he should get it, but he'll turn this place into a chop shop and caused my grandma hell when he did live here, before being sent to jail. He, of course, is no longer allowed to live here because of past issues such as illegally buying and selling cars, and owning a lot of guns with shady people coming around. 

Since before my grandpa passed, I was told I'd be getting the house since no one else is interested on actually keeping it in the family. After he passed, I was told grandma signed the house under my name so it will be mine after she's gone. But I've found out that she hasn't done so, and is debating on not leaving a Will at all because it's ""too much work and will lead to more conflict"". I'm worried that if she doesn't situate everything herself now, there will be lawsuits after she passes since most of the family only wants to take everything she has now. 

I've almost been living here for a year, and plan on staying until she does pass at least, since she suffers with major depression and she just refuses to take care of the house. If she doesn't create a Will or hasn't actually signed the house to me, will me living here for an extended period of time mean that the house becomes mine by default? What can I do to prevent lawsuits and more conflict in my family? What will happen to everything if no Will is left behind?

I live in Washington State, and am sure that she has at least 20 years, maybe more since she does take care of herself.

"Estranged grandmother died, left us to a mess This is in Indiana.
Four days ago, my grandmother passed away. My father and I have not talked to her in over 10 years, she cut us off after many arguments about my biracial relationship and children...she was incredibly racist and did not approve, enough to move away and tell us to never speak to her again.

Anyways, she lived in a small apartment by herself that she rented and hoarded herself to death in. She had very little (if any) assets of value and no life insurance policies that we know of. No 401k or pensions, I believe she lived off of social security and a part time job.

We discovered her death from the landlord, who said my grandmother had listed my father as the emergency contact. He let us know that we absolutely needed to come to her town (100 miles away) and get her apartment cleaned out so that he can get it rented out again. He also let us know that we would be responsible for all damages that my grandmother had caused. From what he stated, my grandmother's body is located at the county morgue, awaiting family.

My question is, can we just ignore this entire situation and go on with our lives as if this never happened? My grandmother means nothing to our small family, and frankly, none of us really have the time or extra funds to deal with any of this. My father was an only child, and my brother feels the same as us, wants nothing to do with it. Can we be sued by the landlord (or the county holding her body) if we don't do anything?

"Bill for a streaming site I haven't used. Info about the location: I'm Swiss but the site is German.

So, my brother and I wanted to watch Pearl Harbor since he needed to write a summary about it for school.

Since we didn't have the movie and didn't find it on Netflix, we said fuck it and went to online streams.

Many sites didn't work until we found one that did. But they required an account for using fullscreen.

I thought ""Well, I'll just use a wrong username and my trash email."" Then they asked for a mobile phone number and I googled fake numbers since I was too tired to search for a new site at this point. Then they required to open an SMS they sent to... the fake number which obviously doesn't work. So I quit the process.

I searched for a new site which took some time but we could watch the movie succesfully.

Today I got an email saying ""Your free trial of our service has ended and thus we renewed your subscription for one year. A payment of 395€ is due in 3 days.""

I think I should ignore it, because:

1.) I never made an account. I left the site before that happened.

2.) Is a 3-day payment with automatic subscription even legal even if it's supposedly written in the terms of service?

3.) Would a streaming site with questionable legal status really ask authorities for the real adress like they said when they only have an IP adress?

4.) They gave the ""supposed coordinates of my device"" and that wasn't at all where I live.

5.) A big ""pay now Button"" and an ominous link to ""cancel something"" in an email seem really unprofessional.

"girlfriend's parents had her sign a power of attorney document - should i be worried My girlfriend (19) has less than stellar parents. Generally just very controlling people. We are both on break from uni right now and her parents told her she had to do a document signing. It was a document solidifying their power of attorney. First in line is her dad, then her mom and uncle. 

My understanding is though that next of kin automatical have power of attorney unless a spouse is involved. So why sign a document to solidify something that is already automatic? Also is it normal to sign that for a child ASAP? Also apparently she felt very rushed. Her mother was like ""we already told you what it was, why do you need to read it?"" There was a lawyer there of course who confirmed that it was for POA but also didn't encourage her to read it. I just generally don't trust her parents and am... worried. 

Another thing I am considering though: This document would take precedent once she is married, so her spouse would not be able to make decisions unless this is changed. My girlfriend and I are lesbians and her parents aren't too keen on that. I'm worried that they're counting on us or any future partner she has not overturning this POA document because they don't quite approve of the whole lesbian thing.

"Misdemeanor charge at a park after closing Colorado. Looks like the voice recorder didn’t hear me say it for the title. Sorry! Still a Reddit novice, and not too great with the smartphone I was given yet either.

I was charging my electronic devices under a picnic shelter since the library was already closed when my charge block died, and my phone threatened to follow. (I’m a car-dweller with a nonfunctioning charger port / cigarette lighter in my car, and depression that ranges from “I screw everything up” to “if I could stand the pain, this knife would go much deeper” depending on the day).

Google said the park was open 24/7, and being new to Colorado at the time, I just figured they were awesome like that with some public parks always open. I was desperate in any case since I rely on my GPS for every turn I make, or near enough. There were a lot of people there when I arrived, and I admit, I managed to fall asleep while my stuff was charging. I’m frankly shocked I wasn’t robbed blind.

The police showed up after I had already packed my stuff into my car. I was getting ready to deal with a feminine hygiene concern in my passenger seat when they arrived. Five units. After a very tense, humiliating hour of questioning and so on, I was given this piece of paper that says it is a misdemeanor I am facing.

—What is the worst that might happen on (and resulting from) my assigned court day, bearing in mind I am a day laborer, officially considered homeless, and don’t have a bank account since I have no home address where I could receive a card?
—Is there any chance I may have to show up more than once in there?
—What do they do to people that don’t get legal representation, and what happens if they can’t make it to court on that day?

"Landlord hasn't stopped neighbors from smoking inside building I rent 1 unit in a multi-apartment building in Pittsburgh, PA.  At least one of my neighbors regularly smokes cigarettes inside the building, and the smoke smell comes through the heating vents and fills my apartment and disgusts me.  At one point I saw one of my neighbors smoking in the hallway.  My lease (and, I am guessing though I don't know for sure, all of the other tenants' leases also) prohibits ""careless"" smoking as well as smoking that causes harm to others, and states that anyone who does so will be held accountable for violation.

I left a polite note out on the front door asking fellow tenants to please not smoke inside the building, but my note was partially burned (presumably by a cigarette or cigarette lighter) and left on the porch.  I called the landlord several times after this, and after one of my calls he went as far as to put up a sign in the hallway telling tenants not to smoke in the halls....but there is still smoke regularly coming through the heating vents weeks later.  So, obviously my neighbor(s) will not listen to me, and my landlord either gave me a different lease than he gave the others or he is simply not enforcing the terms.  I have not been able to get a hold of him directly, only his receptionist, and the receptionist said that he would call me but he has not called me.  On one past occasion when he called me regarding a different matter, the caller ID and number were hidden.

I cannot afford fees for an attorney.  Is there any way that I can more forcefully persuade my landlord and/or my neighbor(s) to address this issue, apart from simply leaving more notes, trying to have a conversation, or leaving more messages with the landlord's receptionist saying the same thing that I've already said?",legaladvice,t3_dkorep
"[OH] I think an ex may be trying to pass off my newborn as someone else's Baby was born in early October.

She dissappears mid February. Doesn't reappear until May. Says she's pregnant but there's no way it's mine bc she had two periods after me. It's that boyfriends I mentioned earlier who I guess came back and said he was lying about cheating so she took him back? (That doesn't make sense unless that baby is seriously premature.)

"Wife had affair with contractor, what can I legally do to him? Hired him for a month long project on a rental.  Wife and I were working on it as well, she during the day along side him while I worked.  
Affair started end of July. She told me she wanted a divorce a month later.  A month after that I found out about the affair.  15000+ text messages, 25 hours of calls.  Texted almost every waking hour (I made a pivot table. It is revolting to look at.)  She admitted to going on dates, going to his house, etc.

Anyways, divorce pending.  I just found out about a sizable inheritence.  This is going to separate accounts so I wont have to share.

I don't want to do anything to jeopardize anything in the divorce, including inheritence.  Also dont want to do anything illegal regarding him.

My wife has the blame, she was the married one.  However, I believe people should know about this man's lack of integrity before inviting him into their house and possibly having a similar experience.  And I want revenge.  This POS shook my hand, looked me in the eye and told me I could trust him.

Can I do any of the following:

Tell our real estate agent about what happened so she doesn't recommend him to others?

Post negative reviews about him online?  I don't know that I want to publically state my wife had an affair yet.  Can I just say something like: ""He lacks integrity.  Avoid.  If you do hire him, protect yourself by ensuring you have cameras installed in the worksite.""   If I do decide to publically share the affair, can I post that?

"Is this illegal? \[United States - NEW YORK\]

Hi everyone,

I just have a quick legal question regarding something I did years ago. Around 3-4 years ago, I was interested in nudism and the nudist culture, so I decided to do some research on it. I watched some videos about it on YouTube although I was concerned about one video. This one video I looked into that was a preview/trailer, although the link in the bio (which brought you to another website with this one video) was the full video. The full video had fully-nude minors who were running around. There was nothing sexual about it, and I don't think it was the illegal stuff. I vividly remember that the website had a section asking if the video was legal, and the website said yes as it was non-sexual and even gave an example on how if every parent who posted an image of there child in the bath would be arrested if it was illegal. I visited the page twice in the span of one week.

I'm still a teenager, and I'm going to be graduating soon. I don't want to have the thought in the back of the head that my life will be ruined because of this. I'm a good person, not interested in pedophelia or any of that stuff. I'm very disgusted by that type of stuff and have NO interest in it. I'm very worried that my actions from when I was younger in the past will come back and haunt me. My question is did I do anything illegal? Will I get arrested and charged? What are the chances that I'll get in trouble?

Fairly standard non-disparagement, no poaching of customers/employees, no suing in the future, etc, in exchange for $18K.

"My car was stolen, striped down, and now the tow company wants me to pay them for the tow and storage fee's. [California] Hello Reddit Legal, 

First time poster and I will try my best to include all details and not break any rules. Sorry in advance if my writing sucks. 

As the title says, my car was stolen a few weeks ago in San Francisco and I was notified yesterday (10/18) by SFPD that they found my car in Oakland. I had filed a Police report at the time of thief in SF and filed an insurance claim. Insurance basically told me that they could not help since I only had liability courage and not comprehensive. They closed the case. Fast forward to yesterday, I get a call from SFPD that they found my car in Oakland. Per their instructions, I went to the closest SFPD station and signed a ""vehicle release form"". I called Oakland PD afterwards and was instructed to take this form to the Towing Company located in Oakland. I get there, hand them my ID and form and request to see my car. The thief(s) had literally taken everything, wheels, bumper, seats, engine/tranny, even my workout shoes were gone. It was just scrap metals sitting in their lot. I am really sad at this point and I head back to their office. I ask the employees working the front desk what are my options here and they present 1) Pay $685 for amnesty (they explained it as basically the car will be their problem now) or 2) Pay ~$880 to take it home (obviously I was not interested in this option or was it physically possible). 

I asked for a breakdown of the $685 charges and from what I remember it was $385 (tow fees) + $300 (100/day for storage) = $685. I tried to explain that I was notified about the car's whereabouts hours ago and asked them to waive the storage fee's. Their response to that was I can pay the full amount now and battle the charges later. They said that they will continue to charge $100/per day it sits in their lot and after a certain amount of time (I think the lady said ~6weeks) they will place a lein on the car and send it over to collections. 

I am at a crossroad here and really feel like the whole situation is terrible and unfair. I really don't want to pay the fee's but if I don't have a strong case here, I may just have to. It is A LOT of money. 

Please note: I still have a copy of the police report I filed weeks ago, vehicle release form and a voicemail from the office dated 10/18. I also took pictures of the car at the lot.

"I fell and injured myself in June. Has it been too long to consider pursuing damages? I'm in Pennsylvania. On June 19, I slipped on an wooden outdoor staircase, and the fall aggravated an old back injury. I didn't seek medical care because my dad is a retired doctor and I mostly defer to him for my aches and plains. But since the fall I haven't been able to sleep comfortably, exercise, and I've generally been pretty uncomfortable and miserable.

If it's relevant, the staircase is part of the building where my boyfriend lives, and where I also lived for many years. The building is a restaurant with apartments above. The landlord owns the building and runs the restaurant.

Since I know the property owner and have always been on good terms with him, I haven't really felt comfortable with the idea of a lawsuit. But it's been four months and the pain hasn't gone away. The steps have always been a hazard (it's not the first time I've fallen down them) because when they're wet they get super slippery and often have algae growing on them.

I ended up reporting it to my coach after a training trip to Myrtle Beach for the week. Some of the things that happened over the semester were sexual harassment, bullying, cyberbullying, forcing me to drink (I was 18), and making me sign a contract to get drunk with the members of my event group for 4 nights while on the trip (the consequences were making me eat an edible). My coach initially tried to have me meet with the two girls who instigated most of it, which I told her I was very uncomfortable with and and alluded to possibly quitting the team. She then reported it to the head coach, he talked to me about it, I told him most of what was going on, and the he said that he would have to report it to the AD. The AD reported it to campus police, they interviewed me and other team members, and then made a report (I have a copy). The situation then went to Student Conduct and they conducted their own investigation and interviews.

 She had the baby in Jan and stayed there up until July because she said it wasn't good for her mental health and that my aunt's house had too many rules. (No smoking in their car, get a job within so many days, etc ..)

This happened several times and I never attempted to make physical contact with him. Eventually the RLC came and I came clean and said I just was trying to not get in trouble. The cops showed up because the campus security officer claimed I “assaulted” him despite the fact that he was the one getting in front of me. I was arrested and charged with possession of alcohol by a minor and simple assault (both simple misdemeanors). I spent the night in jail but was given a court date and released this morning.

I elected for a court appointed attorney because I don’t have the funds for a private one but I might be able to get one if I absolutely had to.

I figure I’m pretty much fucked about the minor in possession since there was alcohol in the room and I was drunk but how do I handle this assault charge? How serious is something like this? Does what I did actually constitute assault?

I also am on deferred disposition in my native Texas for a speeding ticket so that it will not go on my permanent record. Can this offense compromise my eligibility for that given it’s in a different state?

Okay, so I work at a food place as a lowest tier employee, and one of the managers is constantly bullying staff and talking sh*t behind their backs. I tried to find the HR Phone number, but the only one posted is not in service, just wondering what I could do in that situation?

Question 2, same manager as above revealed to me in casual conversation that she has two different food stamps and WIC, however she lied on all the paperwork in order to get it, since she makes more money than I do, and I don’t even qualify... then offered to pose as my mom and push an application through while lying on it “for me”... she also told me she doesn’t report her income at all, and claims that there is no record of it (she has direct deposit)...

"My mom threatened to kill me with a knife. Sorry if this doesn't fit into this thread, but I don't really know anywhere else I can put this in. I am currently 16 years old and live in California. My family consists of a single mother (got divorced when I was in 3rd grade) and a brother and me. Our family is relatively unstable, as my mom got trauma from my dad years ago, and my mom continues to worry about me becoming like my dad. Since then though, my mom and I decided to vow never to physically attack each other. Sometimes though, she has her hormones and I have my grumpy days, so we can get some pretty huge fights during the weekend. I usually cope with this with either distraction or Christianity. Anyways, this weekend, I wasted a lot of her time by asking for rides and later on got grumpy in the morning, so she ended up kicking boxes onto me. Me, being as stupid as I was, decided to also kick boxes onto the wall. She then decided to throw stuff at the door, so I did too. She finally snapped. She grabbed the knife, then tapped the sharp point onto my neck. After minutes of struggling, I got her to get into a room and locked her inside. That was a brief explanation of what happened. What can I do legally? I'm pretty sure as a teenager I don't have much of a choice, but I don't want to continue living like we don't ever have these problems and ignore this. Since I have a little brother, I'm worried that this might ruin his life, and I really don't know what the best option for me is right now. My mom once instilled the idea that whenever I call child abuse, they'll just send me to a foster home and make my life horrible. Is this true? Should I talk to my school counselor/church pastor?

"I got T-boned but I don't think it's my fault, who's to blame and what can I do? So I (18m) was at a gas station and had just filled up half a tank, and decided to pull out via left turn into a 4 lane road which was at a standstill with the lights being red 25 feet to the right. I see a gap in between two cars and assume I can go since it's big enough, but as I pull out the light changes and all the cars start going very slowly of course. The guy (33m) who hit me was just following the one car in front of him (about 9-12 feet ahead) but was also looking at his phone. And I'm almost through when he hits the rear end of my car, dislocating the rear bumper on one side and only really messing up his front license plate. His bumper on the front only needs a buffing it looks like, but I'm afraid he's gonna ask me to replace his bumper, and ideally I don't wanna pay anything and would rather have insurance do it, but only just today did my step dad put me on the insurance plan (perfect timing?) but I've been driving for the past year now. Also, I don't wanna screw my rates for the future since I planned on buying my own car very soon instead of using my parents (saved up over $1,000 so far). If you need more info I'm more than happy to oblige. 

What do I do? Pay his bumper? Have insurance do it? Negotiate just paying him $100 and buffing it for him? He hasn't messaged me and hopefully he just forgets about it.

"Officer lost dash cam footage, can that be used against them in a speeding ticket? Sorry if this isn't proper for this thread but felt like it was the best one to post in.

So an officer pulled me over last month on the 15th and is stating that she radar gunned me (50 mph) on a turn that has a speed change from 45 to 35. She wrote me up for a 50 in a 35. I wanted to use the footage to provide a plausible possibility that they could have radar gunned me in the 45 zone in order lower my ticket from a 15 over to a 5 over. The only thing is that I left a voicemail the day offer getting pulled over (16th), sent an email requesting the dash cam on the 20th but was denied and told I had to fill out a discovery form to obtain the footage after setting up a court date which I did on the 30th, then sent a follow up email on the 11th since I had not heard any information on the request just to make sure it went through. I got a call on the 14th from another officer that said that the officer didn't retrieve the footage in time and let it get overwritten.
 Is this something that could possibly be used against the officer to get the case thrown out? Not sure if obstruction of Justice is the term this may fall under but something along the lines of where I wanted the information but the officer let it get destroyed even with my clear intentions of wanting it from the start.

They told us that they have reason to believe that a child abuse video were uploaded to Instagram months before. They gave email address that we’ve never seen before and sure had nothing to do with us.

So we gave them all of our passwords and they took our laptops and hard drives and phones. They said they will have the phones back after few weeks but laptops will take nearly two years. So we all got our phones back, thank god, and police said there was nothing and it’s all clear but the rest will still take two years.

"After purchasing plot of land, how are the restrictive covenants enforceable? State:  Kentucky

I'm currently looking at an acre or so of land in an older subdivision in order to build a house on.  I had a plan to buy the land now, pay it off over the next couple of years, then start looking into house plans.  However, when I received the restrictive covenants, which were drafted in 1986, one of the first items among many is that ""construction must be commenced with twelve (12) months of delivery of deed to original purchaser"".

The realtor has already told me that there is not an HOA currently present and that the developer/owner likely wouldn't care to give an extension on this.

My question is...how is this enforceable?  If I purchase the land, it's mine to do with what I please (EDIT:  I mean I can build my house when I want, since it seemingly wasn't clear that I only want to build a house).

"(CA / WA) Company is threatening to fire me for reporting Discrimination I have a really unusual situation. Our company is headquartered in WA, but I live and run an outside sales team in CA. The company has three owners, one of which I report to directly, I will refer to him as Chad (not his real name, but fitting). About 6 months ago, Chad decided to hire his wife (I will refer to her as Becky, also not her real name, but also fitting) to recruit and manage a team of lead generators that support my sales team. I don't believe the position that Becky was hired for was posted publicly, and Becky does not have any relevant work experience to do this job. The employees that Becky hires work at retail locations and local events, and their job is to schedule appointments for the outside sales reps that report to me.

Chad and Becky decided that it would be a good idea for Becky to hire a ""Team of Models"". The idea to only hire young, pretty women for this role was mostly Chad's, but Becky thinks it's brilliant. Becky has repeatedly passed on well-qualified applicants strictly based on their sex and / or age. The most recent example was an African American man who had recently graduated college with a relevant degree, and who has recent experience doing the same role in the same industry with a different company while he was in college. Becky referred him to me, asking if I would consider hiring him directly to my team, and said that she, ""just can't see a man doing well in this position."" I have tried to mention my concerns softly several times to both Becky and Chad, but it seems to fall on deaf ears. 

I finally decided put my concerns in writing to all three owners, because Chad is suddenly threatening to fire me for having a, ""negative attitude."" After writing an email with my concerns about their hiring practices, I got a call from one of the other owners. He started by trying to intimidate me, and then shifted to offering me a small severance if I would agree to, ""leave amicably."" I told him I would think about it. 

I then got a call from Chad. Chad asked if I wanted to work things out, and I said that I was open to it but that my trust is broken. He again offered me a small severance if I would agree to leave quietly, which I declined. He then told me that if I would write an email stating that my previous email was a ""misunderstanding"" that we can start with a ""clean slate"". He even had what sounded like a script that he wanted me to use to write the email. I told him that I needed some time to think about it. After thinking about it and consulting with my family, I'm definitely not writing that email. I would be lying to say that I do not believe that their hiring practices are discriminatory. If I write the email that he wants me to write, not only would I be lying to protect him, but I assume that he would then turn around fire me with cause. Chad says that if I don't write the email rescinding my previous email, that he will not be able to work with me anymore and will have to let me go.

"Can my wife's insurance rates be impacted if I identify her as the driver of my speeding car? Apologies if this isn't the right place to ask this question. I thought about posting it in r/RhodeIsland because it's very state-specific but thought I might get more accurate responses here.

I live in Rhode Island, where the state's largest city, Providence, has installed speed cameras in school zones. About a year ago, I received a ticket after getting caught by one of these cameras, and I went to court to contest it. I believe *all* tickets received in this particular school zone are illegitimate, and during my hearing, the judge told me he thought I had a case -- the reasons why aren't relevant to this query, so I won't bother to explain. I ended up just paying the fine because I would have had to hire a babysitter to go to court again, which would have cost just as much. The important point is that while I was in court, I learned from the judge that receiving a speed-camera ticket cannot affect your insurance rates, as they can't prove it was *you*, the owner, operating the vehicle.

Recently my wife got exactly the same ticket in the exact same school zone. While the car she was driving is ""her"" car, I am its legal owner, so I received the ticket. We want to challenge this ticket for the same reasons I had the first time. But she was driving, and I can't go to court on her behalf. The summons includes a form to designate someone else as the driver; it must be notarized and mailed in, and that person can then appear in court. However, my concern is that *this identifies her as the driver,* and therefore the rationale for the ticket not affecting our insurance rates will be moot in the event that she's found guilty.

I'm not sure if state-specific knowledge is necessary to answer this question, but can anyone weigh in on whether it might be worth it just to pay the ticket instead of incriminating my wife and sending her to court?",legaladvice,t3_dku0s3
"My dad was forced to live alone post brain surgery. My dad has lived 4 years with stage 4 lung cancer.  In the past 4 years he has been healthy and capable.  Then things turned downward, he could barely stand, and a tumor was found in his brain.  We were told he could have surgery and the inflammation would alleviate the spinal cord fluid and he would walk better and be okay.  Now, weeks after surgery, he was dropped from rehab and he lives alone. 
One, they never called me to pick him up.  His friend went to visit and called me to tell me he was discharged.  The nurses all believed he lived with family because he was confused and told them that was the case, but I've been on my own for over ten years, my sister is in MA (this is in PA), my mom divorced him over 12 years ago... So he has lived alone for 7 years at the very least.  The math is weird but my mom and him stayed in a house together for a while til things were worked out.  
My dad is a Latino American with a lot of pride and now, confusion.  He refused to move in with me and I really don't have the room.  He cannot afford a nursing home and he refused to leave.  I had to pick him up and take him home to his house which for a moment he didn't remember.  He thought for a second he lived in our childhood home as I drove him to his house.  
He has no memory of bills, mortgage, struggles to use the bathroom, medication, etc.  They discharged him early and I think they were wrong, but they didn't listen to me when I said it wasn't right.  I didn't know what to do so I just took him home.  I tried to make his 2 story house effective as a 1 story, and due to work I'm stuck not being able to be there all the time.  He is tech illiterate, so using a PC or phone is difficult pre-surgery, and he has never had a cell phone.  He is filled with Latino pride and refuses to leave now.  Do I have options?  Is there a way to prove he isn't capable of living alone?  Do I have a means of putting him in a place of care that doesn't bankrupt him?  He doesn't have much money.  I am coming from a place of desperation.  I can go along with him and leave him on his own, which could leave a corpse for me, or I can try to request help?

"My friend has various mental problems and disorders but her abusive mom refuses to get her any medical help. VA If there is a better sub for this issue, please tell me because r/legaladvice was the only one I could think of. 

My friend is fifteen, we are both high school freshmen. Obviously I don't know much about VA law. Basically, she grew up in foster care; it traumatized her and was the cause of a lot of mental problems/disorders. These include ADHD, anxiety, insomnia, and night terrors. She also has an eating problem where she refuses to eat more than 2000 calories a day and will not eat the following day if she does.

My friend was adopted by a woman who refuses to acknowledge that any of her disorders exist. She has physically and emotionally abused my friend. Friend has gone to a counselor to talk about her sleep issues/other issues and asked the counselor not to tell her mom, but she did anyway. This just made her situation worse. I'm not sure how long ago it was.

She admitted all of this to me yesterday but has begged me not to tell my parents. She says that if I do, they will be legally obligated to go to the police or call CPS. (I'm not sure if this is true.) The reason why she doesn't want police/CPS to be involved is because she doesn't want to go back to foster care. It was awful  for her and she doesn't want to be separated from us (me and two of our other friends whom she also trusts). I understand this, I don't think it would be good for her mentally. She has been borderline suicidal before and I don't want her to fall into depression again. But I also know that her home life isn't going to get any better.

Her plan is to make it through the rest of high school and then get all the help she needs when she is in college. This seems like a terrible plan to me because everything could get so much worse in just four years. She needs to get help immediately but without her mom's cooperation she really can't do anything about it.

I shot back that the checkout process did not show any warnings about this, let alone stop me from completing the transaction. As far as I know, our contract is now legally binding and they must send the vinyls for the price that I've paid, and absorb the cost of their mistake. Is this correct?

For some reason 1 hops into a car with Ex with a bunch of her friends and just 1 by himself without 2. So this is the part that the story isn't as clearcut, as 1 was drunk and doesn't remember. Anyway, 1 is found on the sidewalk by cops and is taken home. When he gets home his sisters try to help him out because he got bear maced at some point with the EX and got maced enough that he can't see. A few hours later cops come by and take 1, saying he's being charged with assault. He's currently in a correction facility and is waiting for court Monday.

A few details:

\- at some point, that night 2 calls sister(my GF) telling her about that night. He said that he saw the Ex talking about how she's gonna ruin 1's life on snapchat. 2 said that he recorded some snaps but I personally haven't seen them or know what they're about. 2 also says that she's psycho and is obsessive and she's been like that since they split.

\- Another thing that my Gf said was that she saw the Ex's snaps and that her face looked fine. I say this because Ex said to cops that 1 bear maced himself in the car with everyone in it. 

\- There was a supposed witness that said that she saw 1 beating one of the girls. but the witness knows Ex...

So that's all the info that I have for now. I was just wondering what your guys advice would be for this situation. 1 is not one to look for trouble, but does have a tendency to hang with people that do. The family and I believe he's innocent and that this Ex is actually crazy.

"Father withholding property that I own from me. Cops got involved. Texas. What should I do? Hello! First time posting here so apologies if something isn't right.

For added context, I'm a 22 year old male in Texas.

About two months ago, I voluntarily gave my expensive computer and  computer equipment to my father to let him hold on to so that I could focus on my college, worth a total of about $1100 - $1300.  I bought all the equipment with my own money.  It has been about two months since then and I have done very well in my studies, so I decided that I would talk to my father and tell him that I will be taking my property back.  After all, paid and built it myself.  Once I sat down and told him at the family house, he became extremely angry.   He then physically prevented me from retrieving my property by grabbing it himself and physically ramming me of the way, claiming that he was going to break it or hide it.  

After he rammed me, I tried to defend myself and my property.  It got physical.  My girlfriend called the cops and they came and put me in handcuffs and detained me inside a cop car. My father, who physically touched me first, was not.  Was talked to by the cop about how 'teens are too attached to their electronics' and that I was lucky that I had a cop like him.  I told the cop that I bought all the computer equipment myself, and even built it myself.  Cop said he 'couldn't prove who owned it' so I 'wasn't allowed to retrieve it'.

Long story short my father and I were both only ticketed for ""Assault C FV"" and my girlfriend was free to go inside the house and grab my phone and wallet but not my computer stuff. I wasn't allowed inside. Cop told me that if my father and I come to an agreement the judge might throw out the charges, or I can take my father to small claims court.  So as of right now, my father will not let me retrieve my property.  My girlfriend managed to record audio of most of the argument/ensuring scuffle, so I have that if that helps.

I just want my things back.  From the very beginning.  How should I go about doing this?  Small claims court?  Stolen property?  Does the cops getting involved mean I can't go and retrieve it myself now?  What should I even do in the court if we don't come to an agreement?",legaladvice,t3_dkbfqt

"Help: Security deposit witheld for 4 months and under former roommate's name Edit: I am in Illinois.

Hello, I need help getting my security deposit back as it is still ""processing"" 4 months later and signed to a roommate that moved out. (Note: we are due the refund back according to managment so it is not simply that we did not qualify to receive it).I will try to keep this short. 

The former roommate moved out less than a year into the lease. He moved for the military and I confirmed that he did inform the office and go through the move out procedure at the time. We renewed the lease with just my partner and I on it for another year a few months later. We confirmed this person was off the lease. My husband and I have since moved out ourselves.

Managment, however, signed the deposit check to him (I found this out by calling them, we have not recieved any check from them). They now say that they have since changed the paperwork needed and that WE have to get the new paperwork to him ourselves or they can't change it. Additionally they cannot fix the problem until we recieve the incorrect check. They did assure me that it would be sent to our forwarding address and not to him directly. The paperwork shows that the security deposit was paid 100% from my partner and I's accounts. None was from the roommate. We even had to cover his rent the last month he was a resident because he decided not to pay. I do not want to contact this man as both he and his partner have threatened violence against us and I do not feel safe. I also don't understand how that was not taken care of and how it is our responsibility as they have been aware of it for well over a year and a half. 

We have not recieved even the incorrect check yet and it has been over 4 months but they have not sent anything. I called for the first 2 months and was just told it was processing. I do have a lawyer who I can get involved but would like to talk with them first as it would be expensive.

Please help. I would really appreciate any advice.

"(Canada) I was informally hired by a friend to perform somewhere, but after I did the gig he wants me to invoice the organization that was running the event for half my rate and accept the other half from him. Should I do it? More details in text. So my friend plays this weekly gig for $50 each session and when he asked me to fill in I said no because my rate is $100 for that kind of gig. He said (via texting) ""I could pay 100,"" and I accepted the gig. He emailed me and the organizer of the event saying that I would fill in and he said ""I will pay him 100 for this, as is his rate per hour."" The organizer made no contact with me until I emailed them to confirm the venue the night before, but I worked with my friend to prepare for the gig.

After I finished the performance the organizer said that she wouldn't be able to pay me $100 and that I should invoice the organization for $50 so that their grant officer wouldn't see anything fishy happening on her budget, and that she would get in touch with my friend to figure out how I would get the other $50. I told her that I would just invoice my friend since that was what I had expected. By now they've both told me that they think the only solution is for me to split the invoice two ways. I've never done this before and felt like they were trying to pressure me into something I wasn't comfortable doing, so now they're waiting and hoping that I cancel the $100 invoice I sent my friend and replace it with two other invoices.

I'm not happy about having to deal with this unexpected change in payment, which I think is part of the reason I'm hesitant to split the invoice.

So I suppose I have a few questions:

* Is splitting invoices normal?
* Should I just accept their change in payment method? Maybe I'm going too far with this? I feel like that would be misleading their grant officer and I feel like their budget should reflect the fact that my rate was $100, but maybe that's up to them and I should just accept their fishy two-pronged payment method?
* Is there any chance that I could get in legal trouble for not invoicing as they suggest?
* (I have no plans to take this to court, I would rather just not get paid this time and in future use contracts or at least be very clear with payment methods for future gigs, but) are my friend's text and email any kind of binding contract? Or did I just do this gig in good faith that I would get paid?

"NYC: Security deposit claim Hi guys, my small claims case for my security deposit is coming up and I'm hoping to get some advice on how to win it.

1. I split a 2 bedroom apartment with my sister and her boyfriend
2. They lived there for about 2 years and I moved in for the last 8 months or so
3. Month by month lease

To be clear, we moved in to a dump. My landlady offered my sister $200 just to clean it up when she moved in. We did not take pictures of the apartment before we moved in, only after we cleaned up and moved out. Here is my landlady's argument (she just emailed me it)

&amp;#x200B;

1. harboring a cat into the apartment leading to contamination with cat hair and bad odor.
2. keeping the apartment and surrendering it back to me in an awfully dirty condition which lead to extra expenses. 
3. allowing the water in the toilet to run for your whole tenancy leading  to higher than needed water bills. That eventually also lead the toilet  cabinet falling apart and leakage into the apartment below which needed  to be repaired.

She also says she has evidence of all of this.

We did have a cat, but this court case is only for me and my portion of the security deposit. The cat was my sisters and I'm pretty sure I can claim I had nothing to do with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably important:

1. She never sent us an itemized list of deductions from our security deposit. This email was the first I've heard from her since our vacancy. From what I've read, if we had rented after July 2019 (it's a month by month lease, does this still apply?), if she didn't send us a list of deductions within 14 days of our vacancy we pretty much just win the case. Am I right?
2. No where in the lease does it state that breaking the lease results in the withholding of our security deposit.
3. The apartment was spotless when we moved out, except for the extremely old appliances that we inherited when we moved in. I have pictures of the apartment - there is no way the mess is worth the whole security deposit - there is no mess.",legaladvice,t3_dkkwxh

"Wife tried to kill me and I want a divorce Hello all, I thought I'd ask you all for some advice. First off, I'd like to state that this is about my parents. I'm in my mid-20s, as is my sister, so we're not really worried about custody or anything like that.

I think the best way to start off is to tell you the facts: my parents have been (were?) Married for 25 years. Over the years, they've had separations and even one previous divorce they later annulled. Things have always been rocky and earlier this year they decided to get Therapy. Part of the therapy was to give each other a letter asking for forgiveness for everything they can remember doing to each other that might've hurt them. It turns out they had both been unfaithful at different times. Both incidents were prior to 2002, and happened while they were separated.

My mother had mentioned this to my father years ago, but my father had not. Last week, he finally told her as part of the therapy. It did not go over well...

For about a week, she basically lived in what used to be my sister's room and they had zero contact. Last Sunday, he went back to ask for forgiveness one final time and she lost it. It got bad enough that she verbally threatened to kill him and threw a knife at him (and tried to pick it up to continue but by then he had left the house and was on the phone with 9/11). The police were called, she confessed on camera, and promptly went to jail for 2 days until I bailed her out. She has a felony charge for assault with a deadly weapon. My father didn't not wish to press charges and really only wants to move on from this nightmare.

The final hearing isn't until next month, and she's not living at home. My father is understand shaken by the event and does not wish to stay married. His main concern is her taking half of his assets, including an inherited beach front property.

Lawyers on reddit: how probable is it that my mother takes half of his assets? Is there a way the felony charge could figure into the divorce?

My ex partner is a manipulative and abusive person. Alot happened while we were together that made me dread waking up every day I just didn't want to be here here any more because of his behaviours. Finally I managed to part ways from him without him threatening to kill me which was his usual you will stay tactic. Managed to convince him to part amicably as we have a child. So did my best to make sure their relationship didn't suffer despite my own relationship with him. Skip forward a few months he decides he wants me back there's alot of emotions and black mailing threatening to kill himself all that bollocks but I stand strong and don't want to get back into that world. I told him straight no. I'm done. He's drunk one night banging the hell out of my door and because I refuse to let him in to speak about things breaks in and attempted to kill me. I stopped contact between him and my son. Few months later I slowly allow him to have contact again but only because he bullied me into it. He came to collect some things from the house a while later but I wouldn't let him in without a witness. So he takes what he is taking for that day then comes back in locking out the person that was with him. Starts again with we need to get back together blah blah by this time I'm with someone new ( this is months down the line) someone who's really lovely an dive known my whole life and truly do love and cherish that relationship. My ex starts about how my partner doesn't really know me like he does and all that bull. Anyway I told him it's not happening I'm happy and even if I wasn't with my partner I wouldn't get back with him. He exploded kicking off again and I'm trapped in my own home pleading with him to leave. He snatched my son away and when he came back a few days later he's covered in scratches and cuts. I contacted my support worker and the school and we all report it to social services. There was a long drawn out process but when it was over they said that he's not deemed as a threat and he's saught help for his issues so he should be allowed supervised contact. So that went on for a little bit and I got a summons to court for a custody hearing. I of course got custody but bar the 2 main things there I've mentioned and a harassment case just after,   nothing from the relationship was recorded with police. So he got to have the typical every other weekend with my child. I wasn't happy but as long as he wasn't hurt again there was nothing I could do. Now he's got a new job and he's basically messaging me telling me that I need to throw away the court order because it doesn't suit him and I need to bend to his will or he's going to take me back to court.

"Student Loans: Is it legal to send employment contract to Student Loans Company, given the contract is confidential? Hello, thank you for taking the time to read.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, as the title states, what is the legality behind Student Loans Company (UK) asking for payslips and a copy/scan of the employment contact I currently have, in Bulgaria? 

The contract itself is strictly confidential, but the SLC openly asks for it as a way to prove my overall income per each year.

The problem is, my last 3 payslips (which are considered proof) include referral bonuses, and when I last sent them these bonuses were, of course, calculated as part of my yearly income, but in reality they are one-time things which will not occur again during next year, artificially inflating my income on paper.

I've talked to SLC and they assured me I can send the employment contract on its own, which only includes my normal salary, and it will be used for re-calculation, significantly lowering the monthly payments I would need to do over the next year.

Can I get in trouble if I send them the contract, is it a good idea at all? I am curious why they even ask for it if it's illegal to share it with anyone due to confidentiality. I don't want to risk legal action taken against me from the company I work with.

"Update to eviction notice over $6.00 utility bill For context, this is in Michigan. One if my roommates has lived here for years, myself I’m newer here but I was only late on rent once. 

I posted sometime last week about an eviction notice my roommates and I received. I was told that I must pay $6.00 for utilities or I would be evicted. I thought this was a bit over dramatic, surely no one would actually go through the eviction process over a meager $6. Right? In my last post it was suggested that it was just an automated email and something was being miscommunicated. 

For more context, they do not accept cash, and to pay online, they would charge a $20 fee. None of us are very excited to pay this small sum on its own. 

I went to the office and they said “utility bills do not accrue late fees”, “I do not need to pay it before next rent is due”, and that the purpose of the email (a small detail that was not included in any of the emails themselves) is that we need to put our utilities in our names. They also told me that once the utilities are in our names, the $6 will be dropped from our account. 

So I proceeded to not worry about it. I was told they weren’t going to evict us, and we didn’t need to pay until the end of the month. 

Until today, someone from the office left a paper document saying we have 7 days to pay this $6 or we will go to court and be evicted. This was not just an automated system, this was signed in pen.

We are paid by the hour, and our manager only pays us for the time we are at the event. So if an event if 2 hours long, we get paid for 2 hours that day and do not get paid hourly for the 1-2 hours of travel time that day. Our manager did say that she would reimburse mileage but that’s it.

"Need abortion legal advice after pregnancy resulting from potentially illicit sexual contact Hi I cannot say too much about my situation because I have already been arrested and lost my job as a result of sexual contact with a student. I got pregnant by him as he is apparently fertile.

I am currently on bail after being charged and I am considering obtaining an abortion but I received unsolicited advice from the family of my former partner’s family insisting that I would be destroying evidence if I did.

Question - they have no say, right? Even if the baby is evidence of a supposed crime, I can still get an abortion because it is my body right? My lawyer says I am within my legal rights but I cannot afford a second opinion so that is why I am asking here.

Edit: if I have an abortion this prohibits the court from introducing my pregnancy as evidence, correct? Because it is my personal medical info and also because it cannot be proven whose it is?

"Being sued for small medical bill that was paid on time and before it was sent off to collections I am being sued by a collection agency for a medical bill that was paid on time to the creditor, but the payment seems to not have been properly applied.  The account was transferred to collections 1-2 months after it was PIF.  When the collection agency called the 1st time I kindly informed them it had been paid, gave them the approximate date of payment and last 4 of the CC I used, and to contact the creditor to check where the payment went.  

When they called again demanding payment and following their script over the phone I was more irate but told them the same.  The collection agency has now filed suit, I called them and gave them the date of the credit card transaction and their tone changed from script followers to sympathetic (mistake?)

"My SO was charged $1200 for an initial outpatient consult lasting 15 min with a specialist Illinois.

So my SO was referred to this specialist and whatever medical complaint they initially had to necessitate this visit had mostly subsided at this point with 2/10  lingering pain. They said the doctor was with them 15 minutes with very focused assessment and the final medical decision being “don’t bend over as much” and a list of possible physical therapists just in case. 

We got bills in the mail: $400 from the physician and $800 from the hospital clinic where the visit physically took place. I know facility fees exist but $800 is wow. We called and asked for an itemization for the facility fee. It arrived today and it basically had one line like “yep initial consult that’ll be $800 please.” 

The HCPCS code they billed was 99205. I don’t know much about medical coding and billing, so I googled it and what it described wasn’t how my SO described the visit. Using this as a reference (https://www.cgsmedicare.com/partb/mr/pdf/99205.pdf), I feel like the visit should be a 99201 or 99202. I’m not sure if that would change the final bill at all.

"Smart home device stolen by one of the contractors, I think I might have proof. What should I do? Edit:

Location is \[GA\]

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

Throw back about a month ago, I had some contract work done at home. There were various contractors over throughout the day. I was home most of the time but I wasn't around the work site or keeping an eye on them the entire time. At the center of the work site, I had a smart device (about $100 value) set up. I rarely use this device so it's only until today that I realized this device is no longer there. This alarmed me because no one else has entered my home since.

I went search in my email and found that on the evening after the contract work, I received an email telling me someone was requesting permission to join my home device. That email had someone's first and last name in it. A couple days later, a new email tried to access it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my thoughts/questions:

\-Where should I start to take legal actions?

\-I can likely identify the contractor using the name in the email address but I won't directly contact anyone from the contract company

\-I can probably claim my loss with my homeowner insurance, but I guess I will have to file a police report?

\-Is this theft value too small for the police to investigate?

\-I fear for my safety  if I take any action that leads to this person being punished/ fired, because this person knows my address and household situation.

"I’m realizing I might have been sexually assaulted Edit: don’t know why this is labeled and finance and business and don’t know how to remove that. Sorry. 

When I was a senior in high school and into my freshman year of college I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. There were a few “incidences” that have haunted me over the years as I’ve looked back on them. One in particular I wanted to ask about. I went on a family trip with the boyfriend to Ohio with his parents. We stayed in a hotel and his parents got me my own room and put it under my name. Right before the trip I got a horrible cold and was terribly sick but went anyway. After a family event one evening, I went back to the hotel with his parents and went to bed while the boyfriend went and partied with his cousins. I went to the hotel, took NyQuil and passed out, deliriously sick.  At some point late at night or early in the morning, he got back to the hotel (I found out later he was high on cocaine) and talked the front into giving him a key to my room, saying he was staying with his “Aunt ****”. Basically he came in and had sex with me. I remember being so sick, 99% asleep and delirious from the fever and medication that I couldn’t think straight enough to “care” but definitely didn’t participate. I was asleep through most of it. 

 I don’t remember if I had turned 18 at the time of the event. He was three years older. This was about 15 years ago. I don’t know what I said if anything at all in terms of consent but I don’t think i was really in a place to consent consider how sick and medicated I was. 

I don’t know what this qualifies as from a legal perspective. From a personal perspective I’m realizing over the last few years how it has affected me. Sometimes when I’m sick and have weird  dreams, as I think many people do, I dream I’m being sexually attacked. I don’t sleep well at hotels when I’m alone and frequently prop something up on the door as a makeshift alarm if someone were to open the door. 

Would be interested in the legal perspective. Thanks.",legaladvice,t3_dknsse
"Possible Estate Negligence About a month ago, my two sisters and I became aware of our grandmother’s passing. We were not informed or told by any family, but we found out through the obituaries. At the funeral, our great uncle Jimmy told our mother that we were in the will and we were to get everything. 

Not sure if this was true or not, I called the county clerk to see if the will had been given to the courts. Luckily, they had just been filed and the clerk gave me a copy. It does indeed state that we are to get everything (of course what’s left over after all her debts and taxes are paid). 

My sisters and I do not want to sell the home, but the Personal Representative, our great uncle, states that we absolutely have to sell the home and liquidize everything. 

We setup a meeting with him to talk about some details and get some questions answered. He was less than forthcoming with information and refused to answer any questions that had to do with how much we were dealing with in terms of money. He also refused to give us his attorney’s name. We asked why and he just simply said “I’m not going to”.

After going to my grandmother’s home, the entirety of it had been picked through and several things were gone. We found out that my great uncle and great aunt had an estate sale last weekend without telling us. The listing for the sale is on garage sale sites online. 

Long story short, he lied to us several times during our meeting and kept contradicting himself. So, my question, what do we do? There are several more details that I didn’t add in, but ultimately shouldn’t he be working with us instead of keeping us in the dark and if we all agree about the house, why does it need to be sold? The will doesn’t specify her assets have to be liquidized.

"MA/Federal law regarding breaking lease for health/safety My partner and I are in the middle of leaving our current apartment because of smoking that is going on in and around the building, even though it is prohibited per the lease. I'm a 100% P&amp;T veteran and my partner has chronic asthma controlled by medication so we definitely can't just brush off the secondhand smoke looming into our apartment. I'm sort of new to MA but I come from FL where there is a tenant right to break a lease if the landlord does not fix or cure safety/health issues within 7 days of notification. 

Technically, our lease states we must give a 60 day notice to vacate and pay the lease break fee but the landlord has already broken the lease agreement by not acting on the multiple written notices from us stating there is smoke coming into our apartment. We provided them with multiple pictures of people actively smoking and they refused to take appropriate action laid out in the lease agreement. We have already given them a 30 day notice to vacate, which seemed reasonable to me being that they are not cooperating in fixing these issues - IMO 30 days is better than a 7 day notice. They responded saying we need to provide a 60 day notice and also pay the ridiculous $14k+ fee to move out - both of which I don't think we should be responsible for being that their negligence is the reason we're moving. We have even tried getting them to transfer us to another unit away from balconies but they weren't treating it as a medical accommodation - they still require about $9000 in fees to even transfer to the new unit. It's honestly ridiculous. 

Our lease does not state a specific notice we must give if we're vacating due to landlord breach of contract or because of health/safety/inhabitability/etc. We fully intend on the apartment filing for eviction (for ""abandoning"" the unit) or sending us a bill for everything they're demanding after leaving which we will definitely get an attorney for.

"Help abused animal. What do I do? Some back story before we get to the animal abuse part so you can understand what I'm dealing with here...

So about a year ago my sister's ex broke things off with her. She was dating an emotionally abusive man with a religious cult-like family who is extremely secretive. Looks pretty on the outside but on the inside the family are all brainwashed and abused. The mother of her bf is entitled and takes all their paychecks for herself then rules the family with an iron fist. There are 12-13 of them all living in one house. We tried really hard to stay in contact with her but as we didn't know where they lived/she would ignore our texts/phone calls and I had to go to her work to even speak with her. He prevented her from most contact with us and would read her phone and Snoop to anything we said to her. I personally cussed him out multiple times and he hated me especially because I wasn't falling for his bullshit. Finally recently she has seen the light and admits he is probably a sociopath. 

Fast forward to current times.
The family moved to a new house and has been using the neighbors facilities as apparently there are rats in their well. Gross. Also said ex boyfriend has a new girlfriend with a child and she has a dog. Now I'm guessing he is implementing the same emotional abuse in his new relationship as he was with my sister. My boss is friends with the neighbor and she came into my work the other day and notified my boss that she saw two of the boys in their family holding the dog on a leash and beating it. There are four brothers and they look similar from a distance so she couldn't say exactly who beat the dog but she stated she was thinking about not letting them use her bathroom any longer because of what she saw. I mentioned it to my sister and she tearfully admitted that while she was living there she had a hedgehog and didn't notice it had stopped eating its food. She found it dead in it's cage one day and thought it had just passed on. Later on he ex told her he had broken it's leg on purpose because he hated it and that it couldn't reach it's food bowl because of it. It had starved to death. She also admitted that he confessed when he was younger he abused his brothers dog and hung it repeatedly in their barn over a beam with a moose until it almost passed out multiple times. She was terrified of this man and so didn't say anything to us or anyone else. I can't stand the thought of him doing this to that girl's dog. I don't know what her full name is but I don't think saying anything to her specifically will help as a husband of one of the exs sisters has already tried to talk to her and tell her he's scared for the dog and she brushes it off! Someday I believe his abuse will escalate towards her and possibly even her daughter. There is no evidence except word of mouth right now unless I go steal the dog idk what I can do as far as legal wise trying to get it safe. Everyone in town thinks their family is so amazing because they do alot of volunteer work and they fake nice very well. Are there any options anyone knows of other than calling the police with no evidence except an eye witness? I can't bear the thought of this dog dying and being tortured but I don't know what to do at this point their family is crafty and all about appearances so they don't make mistakes like this often.

"School Suspension--Wondering if Charter applies Hello. Two days I got suspended for a short film I shot outside of School that was deemed offensive. The film was called (n-words) on the beach by a friend but I referred to it as Kidz on the beach. The Vice Principal had informed me that I had actually referred to it using a racial slur and had targeted kids who were mentally inefficient to join a short film I was part of. At the time I had not known they were mentally inefficient because of the interactions between them but nevertheless, I was accused of targeting them to join the film. I never gave details of the film unless I was outside of the School during home hours (After 3:05 since that is when School ends). All this put together is a reason I was suspended for two reasons. The other reason I was suspended was that the Vice Principal assumed I had created an account that parodies another student while involving other students in text-based story's. I caught wind of the account and had not brought my phone on Friday due to the daily activity of the account during School hours however despite the activity of the account and the absence of my phone, the Vice Principal accused me of using another person's phone to become active on the account. I mentioned to the Principal that I knew who it was and mentioned some other things. I mentioned that before the account was created, the friend who I knew owned the account told me the account was going to be basically, ""I dropped my pencil today but my friend (NAME OF FRIEND) picked up the pencil and saved my life"" but the account then got turned into talking about students and teachers inappropriately after they received the pictures. The VP had told me that he assumes I own the account and even if he were to go with my story, I contributed images to the account which makes me a co-owner of the account. He then goes on to tell me that he had found my Private account and noticed that 2 accounts I own (A meme page account and a private page account) mean that I am breaking Instagram's ToS of not being able to own more than one account and demanded that I delete the account which I do not want to own immediately. Another thing to note is that last year when I had gotten in trouble for saying hello to a student I did not know in the hallway which was viewed as mocking them (I said hello to everybody in the hallway) he informed me that he would be harder on me next year (in reference to this year). All this aside I am wondering if he can be affected by the charter like the right to remain innocent until proven guilty, a fair and unbiased trial, the right to not be unreasonably searched (He had searched through my phone after taking it from my hands and had gone through other peoples phones looking for the phone number of the other student (friend) who doesn't attend the school anymore) and possibly any other sections. If I am not protected from the charter, can I do anything? Currently, I am suspended from School with no date given of returning back and told by the VP, ""and that's if you even do come back"".

"How is property handled that is still in the name of the deceased owners but is lived in by one of their children? So I have a friend who's grandparents passed away some years ago. His father now occupies the house that they lived in. His father has two siblings, both of whom I assume would have claim to the house. As it stands, the house is still in the name of the deceased parents. If his father dies, since my friend is also living there with his wife and children, how is this handled? Can he just assume ownership? Would his uncles have to get the house deeded to them and pay inheritance tax on the value of the house? Can they do nothing and as long as the taxes are paid the county won't care?

"Lawyer engaging in predatory proselytizing (US-CA) This is in California.

I have a very successful criminal defense lawyer who is putting a lot of pressure on me to convert to their religion, under the general assumption that it's already my religion and I just don't know it yet. Even my relatives who are of the same general faith are uncomfortable with how this lawyer will hold forth, but are also astonished at my audacity to complain in my situation. The fact that I'm in a very weak position to complain is what makes me feel so violated. I categorically have a problem with how this lawyer takes advantage of their clients' vulnerability in order to swell the ranks of their faith. I suppose I'd rather be a fake convert than a prison inmate, but it wouldn't take much digging on social media to raise doubts in court about my sincerity. I've read that it's not always easy for attorneys to quit, and can be ordered to stay on the job. If my lawyer sabotages my case it lowers their success rating and leaves them vulnerable to a malpractice suit by me. Or so I speculate, but clearly I'm here because IANAL. I don't want to dismiss my lawyer, I just want them to stop being so heavy-handed because it's making me extremely uncomfortable.

In my position would you bite your tongue, dismiss your attorney in favor of another, or frankly tell your lawyer how uncomfortable their approach is making you? This lawyer attends six services a week and has ZERO room for doubt about their faith, and will assert it as concrete fact that my reticence (not to mention my legal trouble) is a symptom of my rebellion against the divine.

"Best route in breaking a lease due to secondhand smoke (Boston, MA) For background, my boyfriend and I have lived in this ""luxury"" apartment building for about 4 months. It is a 100% ""smoke-free"" building and every tenant is required to sign a no-smoking addendum in their lease. Secondhand smoke is a huge problem for us here, I'm a 100% P&amp;T disabled vet while my boyfriend is a chronic asthmatic requiring multiple medications to control symptoms. While the secondhand smoke aggravates most of my conditions, there is no direct evidence I can show in court proving such harm has been done - and same for my boyfriend, he just has asthma medication prescriptions he takes. There are 0 ""no-smoking"" signs in the entire complex - including the elevators. The building is staffed and there are employees present most hours of the day. I have taken pictures of people actively smoking on their balconies and submitted it to management twice - they apparently ""talked"" to them about it but they continue to smoke. Management promised the first time we wrote them that they would send out an email and post signs; they even acknowledged the photo of our neighbor actively smoking and did nothing. A month later and there was no change. Matter of fact, a dude across the courtyard is ripping on his bong as I write this.

Last week, I submitted a 30 day intent to vacate due to the landlord's negligence in curing these issues; it's all just a big health hazard. Not to mention, the landlord is not conducive in fixing the problem even though they advertise the building as ""smoke-free"". The building manager replied and told us we can't break our lease and that if we leave we'd be responsible for the remaining lease. Instead of handling this himself, the manager passed the issue to his assistant manager, who then had us meet with a leasing agent, which made no sense but we figured they'd allow us to transfer to another unit away from balconies. We met with them this morning and they told us they'd be happy to transfer us to another unit but we would have to pay back concessions ($8600) and pay the transfer fee (\~$5000). They even explained how we'd be responsible for the remainder of the lease (\~9 mo x $4400/mo) if we chose to just leave. MA has no statewide law prohibiting smoking but the City of Boston does, I just can't find the exact law. We are desperately trying to get out of this apartment without having to pay through the nose in ridiculous charges, not to mention the possibility of an eviction being filed if we ""abandon"" the unit.

"Inundated in Automated Speeding Tickets - What to Do? My wife and I  moved to the DC area a few months ago. We recently started to receiving almost daily automated speeding camera tickets for $200-400 a pop from violations back in in August. My wife is not an aggressive driver (quite the opposite), and most are for minimal amounts over (12 MPH). She is a teacher, and apparently there is a camera on her route to school, as the tickets are all from the same location on her commute. She has obviously stopped speeding (read: she now drives slower than the normal flow of traffic), but we are already about $2000 in on speeding tickets, and she has been driving this route for months. 

We are worried we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg here. The tickets took a long time to get to us because we have mail forwarding set up from the address the car was registered in to our new DC address and things take a while to process through the forwarding system. So the fear is we could end up 10-20k in the hole by the time the tickets catch up to us. I feel like we are caught in some odd glitch of the system and there must be a way to handle all of these violations in a more holistic manner. My feeling is that though persistent, the violations are not egregious. I don't think our local gov't is intending to bankrupt normal citizens with their traffic cameras? Would there be some sort of way to go in front of a judge or go through some sort of appeals process to deal with this?

 I think the argument would go like: Yes, she was speeding, and she should pay a fine. When she learned she was speeding, she stopped. But the system was set up in such a way that the time between her getting fined for speeding and learning about her speeding was so long that she unknowingly racked up 4-5 figures of speeding tickets. We wouldn't be contesting any one of these tickets, but making an appeal to be relieved from an excessive and unusual situation. We are pretty desperate at this point - I would love any advice or experience here.",legaladvice,t3_dkoj59

"[MI] Was ""Banned"" From An Arcade for 'Winning Too Many Tickets'. Did NOTHING Illegal. Won't Give Me My Money Back or Item Which I Redeemed For. I had been going to a certain arcade consistently for about 16 months. They have been offering prizes for a set amount of tickets. There have been several games in which I am skilled at and can win jackpots enough to get those prizes. 

The fiasco of this was the fact that their card system began to have problems, and showed me different card values for the three locations. I usually check to see how many tickets I have from each location. Normally a proper card system would be able to show me all of the tickets for that company total for all of the locations. This specific arcade did NOT. I, along with a friend, found out that the card did not link up, and that there were different ticket values at all of the locations which had a card system. Either way, I found out that I had different ticket amounts in the three locations.

On Thursday, September 19, 2019, I went to the first location (will called it Location A) and turned in many card sets to give me 8,000 tickets. In addition, I played my favorite game - Bean Bag Toss - and won a considerable amount there, so I left Canton with 92,000 tickets. I went to a second location (Location B), and played a few games of Quik Drop. I checked my card and saw that I had 61,000 tickets, so I was a little elated. I instantly redeemed 50,000 of the 61,000 tickets for a Nintendo Switch. They took down my phone number, and I was on my way. I went back to Location A and saw that my 92,000 tickets were still there. Which meant that I had won different ticket amounts at different locations. (In all honesty, I had been to BOTH locations and I - along with my friend - asked why they were all different ticket amounts at different locations, and they said they would deal with it - yet that was MONTHS before all of this even happen, probably around May or June of 2019, so I went with the different ticket amounts at different locations). Nonetheless, I went back to Location A and redeemed for a PS4 Pro.

Everything was fine, until September 26 happened. I go to a third location (Location C) and was about to load $100 on my card to play again. Suddenly the employee said that my card was locked. I wondered how. And even the employee saw that I had 63,000 tickets on my card. Think about it. There were STILL 63,000 and I redeemed for a Switch AND a PS4 Pro? So I blew it off and thought maybe there was some type of error that happened. So I get another card and put $100 on it. Everything was fine.

I called the corporate office on September 27, asking about the issue about that specific card. They said they would give me a week. All good. Good thing I got the other card. I took a break from that company and went to the other arcades.

On Thursday, October 3, I go back to Location C. The employee saw me again, asking me if I got my card straightened out from Corporate. I said no, and he told me that I would usually hear from them on a Friday. So I was hoping to get back in action. So I go to my main game - Bean Bag Toss - whoa. they changed the settings from 750 of a jackpot to 500? They raised the score up, and you only get 19 seconds instead of 22? I played, got a few jackpots, and the left IMMEDIATELY. I got to Location A an hour later, and what do you know… the jackpot got changed from 500 to 400?! Well… this was different. I had a feeling like… well, I know why they changed it. They must have tracked my history and figured it out, and did that to those two locations. 

Then comes the day of infamy - Friday, October 4. I get a call and they tell me, “We want you not to come to our facilities anymore”. We get into a long chat about why and such. It was 15 minutes each session. But nonetheless, I was literally devastated.

There were some things which should NOT have come out of their mouths. Yes, I got the Switches, but did it matter what I did with them? They claim that the arcade is a “place to have fun and not just for people to get prizes and sell them”. Well to be honest what right do you have to ban people because they win prizes? As a paying customer I should have been respected to win the prizes. I could have respected just the lowering of the jackpots on the games and all but the outright ban? That said something. I did not tamper with any of the machines or games to win the tickets, nor did I ‘exploit’ the system. That’s not something I do. There was an error on the system which was given light to the managers - not just by me - but by my friend - MONTHS beforehand, and nothing was done. That’s their fault, and their card company.

The card company supposedly did this investigation while my card is locked, yet why did the employee at Location C tell me that I still have 63,000 tickets left on the card on September 26? It did not make sense at all. 

I was told that they were “not going to press charges”.... come again? First off, charges of what? Fraud? If they even thought of that, they would have a massive lawsuit on their hands. It took them months to fix an already disorganized system, and all of a sudden they “suspected fraudulent activity”? If their card system was fixed in JUNE this would not have happened.

This next one infuriated me. They told me they were not going to tell the other places that I “abused their system”. First off, I don’t think they don’t have a right to. If they did, I hope the others blow them off. I had only focused on their arcades because it was fun to me and that I could win there. I guess after their decision I guess I never have to see a certain area again.

Lastly, their “Zero Tolerance” Policy is poppycock. Yeah, sure, I know what they really have a zero tolerance for… people who can win a lot of tickets. It was clear on their mind when they talked about ‘their arcade is for fun and not for selling stuff’, and seeing when I saw the jackpots lowered on October 3. I know what their “zero tolerance” REALLY is for. 

What I believe is that this was a discriminatory practice done by this place, and since they made their decision, I will make my own. I will be making charge-backs for ALL of the money I have spent from July until September. If I can’t use the unused credits I have, I want ALL of my money back. Plain and simple. I may also pull forward into telling other people about this place and such, which will be told on all of my social media networks. I have zero tolerance for persecuting what I do with my tickets. I do not heed to predatory actions like that. I know I will not head to their locations again (and will start referring that NO ONE goes there anymore).

One of my charge-backs was denied. I still have not got any of my money back yet. I feel like they may also have cancelled the ordering of the Nintendo Switch which I redeemed for at Location B on September 19. I am pondering my next course of action. What should I do since I feel they probably cancelled my prize redemption, and that my charge-backs were denied? Am I still entitled to the prize? Should I take action against this company?",legaladvice,t3_dk0df7

"How does child support work? Edit: I live in Phoenix, Arizona, USA



I honestly have no idea what the flair for my post would be, but my father is a douche and that is what led to this. 

A few years ago, my father cheated on my mother with her best friend(she was also my best friends mother) and left us. He stopped paying bills and stopped supporting us for about a year and a half. He then wanted to start a relationship with us but we refused because he hasn’t even apologized about what happened(to this day) and occasionally says good morning or something dumb like that. My mom has been having a ton of trouble with bills lately and wants to take him to court for child support. My father is a douche(refer to flair) and I don’t want a relationship with him(neither does my twin sister). We are both 15, turning 16 in February, and I’m afraid if we take him to court and he can request we start spending time with him. I’d like to think our opinion in this matters but I know that depends on the judge. If we do take him to court for child support, CAN he request that we start spending time with him or is it just he pays and we don’t have to speak to him. 

Again, I’m sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit or if it’s the wrong flair, I just had no idea what to do and the reddit community doesn’t fail me as much as real people.",legaladvice,t3_dkf340
"Received a ticket for failure to stop at a stop sign. Though I did come to a complete stop, I'm not sure if I may have made some other mistake though. Hoboken, NJ (39:4–144) I was stopped at a stop sign at a 4 way, looking at my phone for navigation. GPS had me turning left, but the dot was in the middle of the block so I couldn't tell if it was that left or the next. I decided I should turn here, and began to move forward. Then I saw a cop car coming from the right, and briefly tapped my brake thinking I would stop and let them go first, but immediately thinking better of stopping in the crosswalk/intersection, I continued on. When I was already about halfway across, the cop car also pulled into the intersection, approaching the side of my car. Neither one of us were going very fast and they stopped several feet away, so no injury/damage.

But, they ended up, pulling me over, and gave me a ticket for failure to stop at a stop sign. I was for sure stopped for several seconds while checking navigation, but I think they may have seen the quick brake tap as a half-assed stop, not realizing that I had already stopped before that. I'm not sure why they entered the intersection when I was already crossing though. So I'm going to go to court and plead my case, knowing that I may very well lose in a ""your word against mine"" situation, but I have to at least try.

Questions:

1. Did I break any laws by checking my phone while the car was stopped? (It was on the center console, and I was just looking at it, trying to match road names with street signs, not doing anything else)?
2. Did I break any laws by tapping the brake while entering the intersection?

I want to point these out as explanations of what happened, but I don't want to accidentally end up creating any additional issues for myself. Any other insight/experience into how to plead this case would also be appreciated.

"Is it legal to take from someone's paycheck over bags of ice? And to be working 6+ hour shifts with no breaks? Background: I've been working at a convenience store/gas station for over 10 months now. My boss is a butthole and I am really hating him at this point. For months, him and his wife (his co-owner of their small chain of gas stations) have been taking money from my pay for tiny mistakes (the most had been over $80 because someone drove off without paying for gas). While a coworker of mine, whose been with him for 8 to 9 years, has had the same thing done to her. To the point where she's made sure everything she does is perfect. They haven't sought out for legal advice for what he's doing.

To right now. Yesterday, the ice people came to fill up our ice box and the cooler inside. One of their employees left the ice box outside unlocked. Now, my mistake for trusting them. And within the night, 10 ice bags have been stolen. I wasn't informed of their sizes since 10 lbs is cheaper than 20 lbs of ice.

I had walked into work for my boss to be here. (He's gone as I'm typing this up.) He informs me that I ""owe him"" 10 bags of ice.

"Who to contact to sue county government, law enforcement, employer, and other administrative agencies? As the title says, who to contact?

Anytime I've contacted attorneys and share my story, they tell me I don't have enough evidence or that they simply don't want to touch my case.

Long story short, I believe I have been wrongfully arrested, wrongfully terminated, and have proof of administrative negligence from the courts, clerks, and other agencies in several instances involving this case.

I recently received a copy of a document from the courts I requested months ago which they didn't send and months after taking hours out of my day to contact the clerks and get a hold of the document, I believe they have sent me a forged document to make it seem as if they sent it months ago.

To be more specific, the document has a fresh seal on it with a date from several months ago. Why would it be fresh ink, but backdated to several months ago? It surely wasn't the original as they said they claimed they sent it out months ago but I never received. So something is clearly off about it being back dated but with fresh ink.

So...who to contact? What to do? How much could I expect it to cost? Considering the circumstances would any attorney take the case pro bono or on a contingency basis? I believe this has left me unemployed since 2016 so there are definitely damages that can potentially be recovered.

"NYC Sublet no longer coming/willing to pay. I’m not in the country I had to move for three months to another country on somewhat short notice. Because it was so stressful I wasn’t terribly focused on finding a sublet for my room in NYC. I was just going to eat the cost instead of adding the stress of interviewing a parade of weirdos on top. Well it happened that my agency (who arranged for this travel) had a person looking to move to NYC and they wanted to take over the room for the whole time, perfect right?

Stupidly I didn't do my usual mountain of paperwork getting a deposit, background check, etc. because I figured the contracting agency owner and I are so close this gives the subletor accountability. 

Well now it’s more than a month into the trip, the sublet kept delaying the date, has not moved in, not paid a cent, is in another state, and now won’t move in at all or pay (honestly not sure she can). She will come back to this state eventually though. 

The wrinkle is I only have texts, and her actual tour of the apartment where I verbally told her the rent numbers, when I’d be leaving, her saying she’d be staying until the end etc. as proof of our contract. The other wrinkle is she’s in my agency, it may reflect negatively on me to go to war with someone in the contracting agency that I sometimes have to interact with. 

On September 27 she delayed until October 15. On October 9th she said she wouldn’t come until a week after October 27.

"Should I report the owners daughter? Is this considered a hostile work environment and am I a victim of retaliation? &amp;#x200B;

I was recently moved from salary-exempt to hourly at my full-time job. I was told I would receive the equivalent of my annual salary if I worked 40 hours a week; however, there is a discrepancy with that I am literally just not smart enough to figure out. (Will go into further detail later) 

I live in TN which is a right to work state, so I am aware that they can let me go. I believe I am about to be let go or fired from my current job, so much so that I am having obsessive thoughts and am very stressed out about it, enough to make this post to occupy my time until I can call the FLSA on Monday.

\- Moving On Up

I've worked there for a year, and when I started, I was a part-time salesmen, then moved to the back as a full-time employee. At this time my responsibilities were that of a stockman/warehouse employee, and I took it upon myself to do social media during a time our marketing person was preoccupied with other responsibilities. Although I was encouraged to clock in when I did anything for social media, I never considered it part of my job description. Just before an event being held during the weekend (after my 40 hours), I was moved to a salary position. I worked like this for approximately 8 months. 

\- Broken Promises

During this time, the operations manager came in to my workspace and said, ""You're pretty much our inventory manager."" Eventually I was told by the owner of the company we would soon expand and afterwards I would train my replacement and be promoted to marketing. After expanding into the new warehouse, another employee was promoted to my same position. It was never explicitly stated that I would be training him, but that he was to shadow me. Although, I was showing up early and doing what I considered 'above and beyond', keeping up with their social media, the new employee was abusing his salary position, to the point that the operations manager even states to me, ""If the new employee keeps this up, we're going to move him to hourly.""

\- Poor Communication &amp; Mistrust

During a delivery, my associate received a call while I was driving. I didn't know this at the time but it was our supervisor asking if the both of us would work that coming Saturday, outside of our schedule. I am never asked, and I only hear my associate decline. Upon returning to the warehouse, our supervisor says, ""Forget about the weekend thing, but we've been thinking about moving you guys from salary to hourly."" Over the weekend, I receive an invitation from the owner's daughter, whom at the time I believed to be HR, to download a scheduling app with no explanation. I call would-be HR and asked if I could schedule a meeting for the following Monday morning, but was then informed that she is no longer HR and that our operations manager is now also HR. She did agree, however, to still be present for the meeting. I got the operations manager and my direct supervisor to agree as well. Only after contacting my operations manager was I told about the change in my pay from salary to hourly. He said that my pay rate would stay the same and that I had only worked, verbatim, ""38-ish hours"" the previous week. I do not believe this approximation is accurate. 

\- First Meeting

Trying to be sensitive to us having paid meetings, I created an itinerary, and a copy can be provided if needed, but it included an me for a raise, questions about what was going on, why, etc. I genuinely wanted to open a dialogue between all of my supervisors and myself. The meeting was professional and friendly, however, unproductive. During the meeting, it was established:  
 \- How I was being paid did not change because of a demotion  
 \- May have been because of an associate's work habit but I would be the only one to benefit because I generally like to come in early  
 \- I was told there would be no restrictions on when I could clock in.  
 \- They explained why I did not currently qualify for a salary position, which I understand, although I feel I am understandably upset about what happened and how it was carried out.

\- Confusion &amp; Compromise

I do not know if it's relevant, but after the switch we were encouraged to cut corners on things they previously praised our diligence on, such as stocking the inventory we dropped off. These were not the only changes. At some point, the operations manager and the owner's daughter come into the room with me, my associate, and my then supervisor (owner's son) and informs us that the owner's daughter will be helping my supervisor 'use his time more efficiently' and that our finance person would be helping out in the warehouse (price tagging, picking orders, etc.). I am correct in my assumption that she is there to review how my associate and I operate, but I have no problem with this because I am proud of the way I conduct myself.   
 About 2 weeks ago, I was asked by the owner if I would be interested in some overtime, taking some on-location video and photography for the stores over the weekend, to which I agreed. Perhaps I should've mentioned this earlier, but I had already been acquiring overtime, coming in early/staying late. 

Once on location, the scheduling app notified me that I could now only clock in 30 minutes prior to a scheduled shift. I sent a message to Operations/HR this time that ""it was a shame that I could only clock in 30 minutes before a scheduled shift,"" told them my terms if they wanted to hire me as a private contractor, and asked how they wanted to proceed, but did not receive a reply. Not wanting to disappoint the owner, I still carried out the work. I created an invoice with a very competitive price, because I didn't feel right charging them without first negotiating.   
  Upon returning to work the following week, they paid the invoice I had drawn up, work goes along as usual. On a delivery, I receive a series of emails from the scheduling app that the hours I worked for the previous week had been corrected. While on the road, I call my operations manager, but to my surprise am greeted by the owner's daughter. I'm still not sure what her explanation meant, something to do with our pay period being split up into two weeks and one week, although i've always been paid on the 1st and the 15th. I am afraid to ask for clarification because during this conversation I was snapped at. The next day I am informed by the financial person/warehouse helper that she is now my supervisor (though I respect and like this person, she has little warehouse experience, and I have had to delegate tasks to her), and that they've noticed I'm 'upset' or 'agitated' with the change and if I could come up with a compromise. I told her that I'd like a promotion to work towards, I had some ideas of what that may look like, and that I could write them down, to which she said that'd be a great idea. I spent the following night drafting a job description to be the basis for a discussion, and subject to negotiation.

\- Ambush Meeting!

The next day, my new supervisor asks if I've made something to show her, and I email her my draft. After a short time, she returns and informs me the owner's daughter is on her way and wants to have a meeting. Upon entering the room, the owner's daughter raises her voice in what I believe to be a hostile way. The first time she raised her voice, it was in response to me making this proposition that I was more or less asked to do by my direct supervisor. Without me instigating, the owner's daughter brought up the phone conversation in which I asked about how my schedule was changing. I felt like I was being baited into quitting my job by remarks like, ""Why would you work at a company that you do not trust?"" and ""Why do you want to work here?"" I was responded to with baiting and hostility when expressing that I want to trust them. Initially I was told this was not a demotion, but now was being told it did qualify because they were taking away 'social media responsibilities', but as I stated above, to me, that was never part of my job description. At the beginning of the meeting, she implied that there would not be a promotion available to me ever, and later implied something different, but I still believe her initial response to be both the truth and baiting me to quit. She tried to discipline me on my “attitude”, though I believe a more apt description of my behavior is “visibly upset”. If it had really been a problem, I should have received a formal warning of some kind but never did. When I asked to be provided with an example of my attitude, the only example she could give seemed to be only of her opinion, happened weeks prior, and was never addressed until that moment.

\- 'Tis the Season

He will not be giving the name of the site, or the seller.   I understand the motive behind this, and I do think it could spread awareness to people who lack trust in federal warnings about this topic. However, there is no way he can publish this without legal repercussions, right? He would be telling the world that he illegally purchased drugs online! I am hoping your responses will convince him to think twice.

"Found a turtle skull on a Florida beach. My friend (who doesn't have a reddit account) is in Florida right now in the wake of tropical storm Nestor. She went for a casual walk on the beach this morning and came across [this insane turtle skull](https://imgur.com/a/dvqSOOQ). Obviously she's pretty stoked about this, but is worried about taking it back to her home state through airport security. She wants to donate it to our school, but we both figure that trying to take a skull ~~of such endangered animals~~ is probably begging to be questioned by the TSA. We were both totally unable to find anything through google searches that applied to this specific situation, though. Everything we saw that was remotely relevant only applied to either live sea turtles or already dead sea shells. We both know it would be hard to prove she didn't get it on the black market or poachers, but would they give the dictionary definition of a nuclear family the benefit of the doubt in that scenario? ~~They're extremely endangered~~, so do special restrictions apply to them even if they died of natural causes?

TL;DR: Will a sea turtle skull go through airport security?

"Arrested because of a Clerical error In 2011, a friend received a speeding ticket.  There was a family emergency the day of court, and my friend missed their court date. A warrant was issued, but everything was resolved without incident the following day and the warrant was lifted.

Now, a few weeks ago, my friend is pulled over and told that there is a warrant out for their arrest for the speeding ticket that was resolved in 2011.  They were handcuffed, processed, and spent half the day in jail.  Upon posting bail, they went to court the following day. They demonstrated that everything was paid, and the courts admitted it was a clerical error and profusely apologized.

However, the court of public opinion doesn’t forget. My friend is well regarded in the community, and now this is a blemish on their outstanding record. 

One item that is troubling to me is that my friend has had multiple background checks in the years following 2011 for work and never once did this appear. They’ve also been pulled over in the years since with no issue. While the courts acknowledge they were wrong, there is no reason as to why it happened now.

Is there any case here? I don’t think a court clerk maliciously made the mistake.  However, the humiliation of having your mugshot plastered all over the news in a small town is just that, humiliating.

"New dog in condo building bite mine - Philadelphia, PA I own a condo in a 12 unit apartment building and I’d say it’s probably %75 owner occupied. I have lived in this building for 2 years now and we do have a private management company/HOA and board.

My dog is a 11 year old lab mix, very goofy but extremely well behaved...large, but pretty old/can’t jump up/etc. I keep him leashed at all times in the building and on the property like in our gated lot. 

Recently, a boyfriend of one of the units (a woman who’s living in her parent’s owned condo) brought a dog into the picture. Very obvious pit mix as well. The
dog is simply out of control. The first time our dogs met it was in the gated lot and he asked if they could meet - at first I hesitated knowing my dog is not great meeting on leash (was a stray as a puppy and still has some socialization issues). I expressed my concern but he is wanted to try anyways...needless to say his dog became aggressive and lunged at mine, to which he immediately apologized and yelled at his dog. Since then, I haven’t crossed paths much thankfully while walking mine..though there have been plenty of times I have been coming or going from the apartment and he’s had it off leash on property. The dog is huge, jumps, it’s just not appropriate. 

This past week I had left for a business trip while my fiancé, who’s cared for my dog for almost 5 years now, took over dog duties. That same night I leave, she takes the dog out for the last walk of the day and runs into the tenant, her boyfriend, and the dog. My fiancé was friendly but kept her distance while the tenant tried to coax the dogs to say hi. Immediately the other dog lunged at mine, scared it so much he popped out of his collar and almost bolted. The woman laughed about it and said “there’s no blood, it’s fine” while the boyfriend yet again apologized for his dog.

The following afternoon, my dog walker took out my dog during the afternoon. As he was exiting the gated lot, the woman was coming in with the dog. My walker said the other dog got loose and bolted to mine and attacked it. He was able to get the dog off mine, but was extremely shaken by the incident and called me immediately after. My dog only suffered minor bite marks..but enough where we were concerned if he needed stitches. My fiancé left work to go home and make sure everything was ok..determined he was good for the night after speaking with the vet and planned to take him in first thing in the morning to get evaluated.

Knowing this could be extremely delicate of a situation - I emailed the tenant with pictures explaining the situation, that it was already reported to the management company and our board, and that I will be taking my dog to the vet. I kept it as factual as possible, really being conscientious not to appear emotional/etc even though I so badly wanted to tear into her. Of course 24 hours later, she emailed back at first a bit combative saying dogs just being dogs and it was friendly fire but towards the end, claims fault and offers to pay the vet bill.

Fast forward the next morning - my dog receives a ~$300 vet visit including rabies shots, etc. puncture wounds all cleaned up..it honestly looks a lot worse than it is..but he’s on antiobiotics, pain meds, and eating and sleeping normally according to my fiancé.

The positive thing about this situation is that the building is small, and my Fiancé is actually on the board. The president loves us and my dog, including everyone else in the building as he’s literally just a sweet old man dog and is very well behaved, doesn’t bark, etc.

My question is, where do I go from here? We’re making internal moves to report everything to our board and management company as well as the we are having an owner’s meeting this week (that she for sure won’t be at bc she never has come to any). I have never been in this situation before and want to make sure I am taking all necessary steps to further protect my dog and my family from these people and their dog.

Thank you in advance!

"Is it possible to file harassment charges with my ex-wife who I have kids with? WI My ex wife is abusive on every level. We divorced several years ago but we have kids together and have joint custody where we kinda decide when we want the kids. I want to amend this custody order and cut contact with her. 

Every single day she calls me and starts screaming at me, calling me a piece of shit. She texts me and verbally abuses me every single day. I tell her to leave me alone and block her number. She downloads a texting app and keeps texting me there, by passing her blocking.  I've changed my phone number but she just takes the kids phone and steals it from them. 

She takes the kids phone who are both 14 years old and then calls me and harasses me from their phone numbers. I cant block my kids. She will pretend to be my kids and say very hurtful things to me but I know it's her. She refuses to leave me alone and be a normal person. 

I've been disabled for a couple years and recently got a job and now she says shes taking the kids away from me because I'll be at work and never see them. I've repeatedly told her to stop contacting me, I'm amending our custody order and I can communicate with my kids without her. 

She messages me from about 5 different numbers a day. Calls me upwards of 30 times in a row, insults me through text messages. I finally told her that if she does not stop, I will file harassment charges on her. 

Her response: Lmao.

Then proceeds to message me 30 times in a row insulting me, calling me a horrible dad because I dont make that much money. I block her. She makes a new number. It continues. It never stops. 

I cant afford a lawyer but I feel like this is excessive and i cant do this anymore. I feel trapped. I want to go to the police and am wondering if they will be able to do anything.

"I bought a stolen item online and the police officer on the case stopped responding Backstory...in June I purchase a Mac for a great deal online via OfferUp and it was shipped to me. After wiping the Mac, Mac OS warned me it still had admin controls installed and that it was to a school district in California. With me living in a other state (Arizona to be infact) I called them up and asked them to remove the admin controls. The next day a police officer calls me and informs me by great deal was actually stolen from the school.

After giving him details of the return address, the OfferUp listing and images of the item he informs me that he would contact me in about a week or so to figure out how to fairly return the item since I would lose money by having to ship it. (I did receive a full refund including shipping via OfferUp customer support but I'm a student living on my own so money is kinda tight.)

However, I never hear back from the Officer on the case. Fast forward 3 months later to September, I emailed him as a reminder that I still had possession of the Mac and what exactly he wanted me to do with it. 

It's now been over a month since then, with a total of 4 months since the initial purchase, and I have still yet to hear back.

So my question is, legally do I follow Arizona or California law on this matter? And secondly, what exactly would that law require me to do? Am I to continue to hold onto it until I hear back or after a certain period of time does it automatically become mine?

Edit: Police Officer resides in California in the same city as the school district. He specifically told me over the phone to wait to hear back from him before I sent back the Mac, which has yet to happen.",legaladvice,t3_djzdap

"Landlord entered apartment with absolutely not notice as well as a lease copy availability question. Hello from Indiana.
So I currently rent an apartment right next to my college campus but it is not owned by the school. I was out of town for the weekend so this is according to my roommate who doesn't seem to care too much about the situation. 
So my roommate left the apartment for about an hour and when he came back there was a note and some novel items left on our counter in our kitchen. The note was signed buy the office workers (Only about 4 people) so we know it was left by them. So the problem is that they most likely knocked, didn't hear a reply, and just used the master key (fob style key) to enter. I have looked over and over again in my emails, texts, and on my account with them. They gave no notice and I don't like people who I don't know well in my apartment when I'm not there unless of course my roommate is there. Not doing anything wrong, just don't like it. So what do I do here?

"My girlfriend's family is trying to take her house given to her away Okay lotta backstory here. So I'm (22m) and my girlfriend is 19. I'm in the United States (don't wanna post state if I don't have to) We met two years ago and it's been amazing ever since then. I was in college far from the same hometown we grew up in and met at when we did start dating but I moved home after a hard year that left me worn. Moving forward tho I started a business that did incredible and we don't see it slowing down but instead picking up. And that's all that is really bad about our hometown. so we decided this year we'd stay and work on the business. 

Well I have been at my parents big farm house with me and my girlfriend for a year. She used to live at the home she grew up in. She has a broken family that I have to explain for this story. Her mom had two marriages. The first one wasn't my girls dad. So my girl has three half siblings that are 22, 24, and 25. Then she has a whole sibling who's 12. Her mom and dad are divorced. Her mom and also her sister who's 22, and little brother live at the house that my girl grew up in with her dad and mom. I thought when her dad and mom split around ten years ago he left the house to her mom. That's what they all said to me. Well I saw the taxes notice because it was late for over two years😑 and the deed says to my girlfriend and her little brother. So I went and showed that to my girl and she didn't know that the house was hers. We talked with her dad and he said ""yeah I set it up so you and your brother would have a place to live."" 

Ooh man this made things interesting. So now it's been like a year since we found out. Her mom has been trying to say that house was hers for a loooong time. And her mom was awful to her dad in the divorce. He hates her. So that house wasn't meant for her. And Reddit they've been awful to this house and land. It's just a flop house for them.

"Being sued for car accident after 2 years... and one day Hey guys,

Short story: I rear-ended someone the evening of October 13, 2017, and provided my contact and insurance information at the time.  I'd completely forgotten about it until a couple months ago, when I received a call from an insurance adjuster (at my insurer, Nationwide), saying that the victim had taken no action as of yet and it was likely to simply go away due to the 2-year statute of limitations in Texas.

This morning, I received a certified letter notifying me I was being sued for ""no less than $150,000.00, and no more than $1,000.000.00"" (the typo in the 2nd number is exactly what was in the filed case, so I figured I'd include it), and the victim was requesting a jury trial.  Odd thing is, though, it explicitly states the accident date of October 13, 2017, but also states the filing was accepted on October 14, 2017.

I'll be contacting my insurance company on Monday no matter what, and have numerous options for legal representation if needed, so I'm not terribly concerned... but I do have a couple nit-picking questions:

1. Can the typo stated above (""$1,000.000.00"") in any way be enforced?  If so, I'll just write the bastard a $1,000 check and call it a day.  I can be a bit pedantic... but I'm not sure if the ""no less than $150,000.00"" stipulation would supersede an obvious typographical error.
2. Given that the statute of limitations is 2 years, and they filed it 2 years and 1 day after the accident, am I generally in the clear?  Or is there an unwritten ""or the next business day"" type rule that allowed them an extra day since the 2-year mark fell on a Sunday?

I can't do anything about  it,  the school has a class where you are supposed to write a paper with suggestions to the school, this is a common topic every year, and it is never resolved, i am fairly sure that there was a grant for going smoke free if only nominally. but i found that the butts are a major problem, the get in to the playground all the time, and the results are really bad if a kid eats one. so i wanted to just leave one of those smokers stations with a sign saying something like ""ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING, LEAVE THEM HERE"" then a copy of the schools smoking policy.

"Oil Change Ruined Engine - Contact my insurance or work with repair shop directly? [CA] I recently had my oil changes at a medium-sized, non-chain repair shop for a \~$15k \~20 year old car. They have been around at least 10 years and I have been going to them for \~4 years with no issues. 

Timeline of incident:

* I left the shop, drove home a few miles, then did some errands later that night, and about 10 miles after my oil change my car started shaking. 
* I pulled over asap, assuming it was related to the oil change. I checked the oil and the dipstick was dry, so called a friend to bring me some oil. I recorded myself checking the oil and it being low (time stamped 4 hours or so after the oil change).
* I poured \~3-4 quarts in (car takes \~5 total) and still didnt have any oil on the dipstick.
* I left it there at this point and waited for it to get brighter in the morning.
* I headed back to my car to check again in the daylight the next morning, now the dipstick was covered in oil... maybe it settled? (This worries me a bit now, since I tampered with the evidence I guess...) but I still left it there and haven't moved it.

The shop is only open on weekdays, so I was going to wait till Monday to call them, then have it towed. But, after reading about the situation, it seems like there are a few options for addressing this situation:

1. **Work with the original repair shop directly -** Ask them to cover if there are any issues, record the call, and if they offer to have their insurance cover it, I should be good. **Concerns** \- I do like the relationship with them so far, but I can't guarantee they won't be difficult. I'm not sure if they would cover a car rental, and I worry that they could tamper with an actual evaluation of the car and later say it was not their fault.
2. **Camp 2 says I should absolutely not take it to the original shop**, but instead should take it to another reputable shop, get an estimate of damages, then speak to the first shop to see if they offer to go through their own insurance. If not, then sue them in small claims and hope to win. **Concerns -** This would be safer, but I still need to rent a car on my own, pay for the inspection, etc, and worry I won't get compensated for these costs, could possibly lose in court, and sever my relationship with the shop.
3. **Work with my insurance company directly -** Contact them (AAA) immediately and have them do all the leg work. They would recommend a 3rd party to inspect it, then they would follow up with the original shop. **Concerns -** I get a car rental this way, but I imagine this will cost me my $1k deductible and I worry this might not lead anywhere. My dad had a similar issue, but his insurance was never able to prove fault and he did not get compensated for anything (which I admit could have just been due to his lack of follow up, bad insurance or something else). This would also make my relationship with the repair shop awkward.

**Is there any best way to handle a situation like this?** I have spoken to a few car people I know (1 being a mechanic), but they all give different advice. Mainly saying to just complain to the original repair shop and demand they fix it. I have a somewhat unique car and have a feeling the engine will be expensive to replace, so I want to handle this as best as possible.",legaladvice,t3_dkfpmo

"How do i get started with filing a restraining order and eventually sole custody? North Carolina. **Separation and Custody Details:**

Marine husband and I are separated since Sep 2019.
We have joint custody, I have primary. 
He pays child support per military BAH.
He has visitation- every other weekend, half the holidays, as reasonable, etc.
I live 15 mins from his work, 45 mins from his place of residence.
We are in North Carolina.
He is a recruiter. We’re 3 hours away from the closest base.

**Background Info:**

He has been psychologically torturing me the whole marriage and I’m finally tired of it. He does things like cornering me and yelling at me until I have a panic attack.

The past two years we’ve been entertaining divorce. He called the divorce off previously but it’s for real this time. I’m now realizing that during the past two years he had a pattern of screaming at me, recording it, and then threatening to have me committed. He never did, but always had his phone out as if to call. Maybe he just never had the courage to go through with it.

During these moments he’d record me and loudly say, “see how crazy she is? She is so crazy.”

In an attempt to save my marriage, I’ve been medicated and in therapy. I’m diagnosed with PTSD, schizoaffective bipolar, and BPD. My therapist and psychiatrist have both said they’d vouch for my ability to parent and be reasonable, in court. 

In total, I’ve called the police on my husband once out of fear. 3 times because he didn’t come home and I was worried  - “I’ll be home at 9pm” Doesn’t show up until 3am.

We are now separated and I thought I got out and everything will settle. He didn’t check up on the kids once and never tried to see them until last weekend.

Last weekend, he did the lack of communication again. I texted to ask what time I should expect the kids and he turned his phone off. I have a record I’ve tried calling from 9am to 9pm the day of return, on several phones. Straight to voice mail. I ended up calling the police to do a wellness check at his place though he arrived 30 mins later before the sheriff got a chance to check. 

He knows lack of communication bothers me, especially when it comes to the children so he deliberately never gives me solid times. “Might come back morning, afternoon, I don’t know” (at time of pickup) I think it’s reasonable that by 9pm after no response it’s time to make the call.

An hour later, he texts me that our son tried to grab his penis repeatedly and said “If I find out you and your boyfriend are molesting him, you’re done!” My son has NEVER done this with his brother or my boyfriend!! 

**Why I want a restraining order and eventually, sole custody:**

My ex husband gives me a lot of psychological distress. 

He’s done things like phone people and tell them in schizophrenic. He called my current boyfriend to tell him that. I yelled at him to give my phone back and he laughed, said to my boyfriend “Do you hear how crazy she is?”

The suddenly showing up after a month and a half of him not being around for the kids, and then accusing me of molestation. I called the cops. My ex then accused me of coaching my son. 

My kids also couldn’t get their story straight on what exactly they did when they hung out with their father. He has no bed so they claimed they slept on the floor, but then a bed, but then in their car seats all night. They said they did “nothing” then “people came to his house” and then when I asked who they said “no one.” They’re 6 and 4.

I want him to leave me and the kids alone. I’m honestly terrified. He has a shotgun he doesn’t lock up (I have a recording of him saying he doesn’t care if the then 3 year old got it and he allows the kids to shoot it - I have no issues with guns, I take issue with just shooting and no concept of gun safety.)

His house has no electricity and no furniture. I’m worried about what is happening to the children when they’re there. It’s in a trailer in the middle of the woods. I’m assuming there’s no water cause my ex bathes in gas stations. 

He’s also still a marine so he gets really buddy buddy with cops.

**My question:** Do I have enough to file a restraining order? What costs or issues should I be looking at? Is this something I should do through the military (they said they only work with physical assault issues not psychological so I imagine I shouldn’t bother there) or just with a civilian judge? What are the chances I can even get sole custody without physical abuse?

"NY Real Estate: Don't think the seller's agent submitted our full asking price offer to the seller Yesterday my bf and I decided to put an offer in on a house; by the time we sat down with our real estate agent, she told us the seller's agent told her  that another offer had been submitted just that morning. We really want the house, so we offered full asking price with an escalation of a few extra grand over asking price.

Today the seller's agent (who is also the nephew of the seller and doesn't appear to do really any other real estate) told our agent the seller accepted a verbal offer instead of ours (which was the real deal, with paperwork, deposit, ect), and the seller's agent wants us to wait until Tuesday to see if ""she [the other potential buyer?] can come up""... (come up what? In price? Is that legal?) and then he'll get back to us. Then the seller's agent ducked our realtor's calls and didn't respond to any of her texts for the rest of the day. In the paperwork of our offer, we had it written in the offer expired at midnight today. (Yesterday now, writing this at 1am.)

I don't think the seller's agent told the buyer/his uncle about the offer, because who in their right mind would turn down full asking price in writing for a verbal offer with no paperwork?

"[AZ] Obtaining Court Records for an Ongoing Trial My friend recently started dating a girl who is currently facing Child/Vul Adult Abuse-Intent charges in Arizona. She is clearly lying to him about the nature of the trial, which became obvious after looking it up on Arizona's Public Access Case Lookup tool. (Luckily, she's dumb as fuck so it was pretty obvious that she was lying.) I have a few questions.

What would be the best method to obtain more information about the trial? Case minutes are not available on the lookup tool. Would calling the court house and requesting information result in anything? Specifically, I am interested in the outcome of a plea deal, which I believe was denied. I am also interested in the degree of the felony she is facing. 

There is a codefendant, but charges do not appear under his name in the lookup tool. Does this mean that only she is facing charges? If the title of the case is State of Arizona vs. Her Name, does this imply that she is more ""at fault"" than her codefendant? 

Does the ""intent"" in the title of the charge imply that child abuse was intended, but not committed?

"Internet store prohibiting me from reselling their game codes (Europe) I've been making some money from purchasing and reselling game keys from a few game stores. One has closed my account, saying that reselling game keys is strictly against their terms of service.

Stating this in their terms of service is strictly against EU legislation. As is prohibiting resale, as they have exhausted their rights to the product the moment they sold the copy in EU.

I'm wondering about a few things here. Are they allowed to prevent sales to me for this reason? I've tried reading through some of EU's competition laws, and it seems like they are not allowed to prohibit sales for the sake of keeping a monopoly. They're trying to tell me that people can only buy the codes through their site, and not through other people, and that they still hold the rights to do anything they wish to do with these codes, even after I have purchased them.

"Landlord Living in Garage (Utah) I signed a six month lease for a duplex in a house. It's a house that the landlord split into two apartments, one in back and one in front. Imagine the back part of a house, that's the ""apartment"" he created, which I moved into. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we first signed the lease, I specifically asked him if he was going to live in the garage. I just got a feeling, maybe from something he said, that he would be. He at least said he'd be there a lot working on the garage, to create a new unit. From my own research, it seems that a garage isn't a legally livable space anyway, zoning laws. His response was ""oh no, I'll be fixing it up, but I'll be staying somewhere else."" something along those lines. sigh of relief, signed the lease, happy girl. Until I noticed he was staying here, like for real. He also has a van that I sometimes saw he lived in for the first few weeks, then started living in the garage more frequently. He does other things like blowing up large mountain biking tires (very loud), sawing, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted about this before, but now it's actually bugging me. We have a laundry room attached to the house, that goes to a door attached to our unit and not the front unit. The landlord is not only living in the garage (I see him everyday or hear his dogs barking in there) but he's also using the laundry room, on a Saturday, when he has four tenants living in the house, paying him rent. Another thing that bugs me about this is our front door is a large window-door, and the door to the detached garage is 10 feet from our front door. There's little privacy. He almost saw me in my undies yesterday when I was sick and off work. 

&amp;#x200B;

The perks are: he allows pets. He's pretty chill and fixes things for us, and he's nice. All our utilities and internet are included in our rent. Between me and my partner, we pay $400 a month each. So that's pretty awesome. He lets us smoke (cigarettes, outside on the porch) which many other tenants wouldn't allow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of just being open and talking to him. Like hey, Landlord, I've had this on my mind for awhile and we really appreciate how awesome you've been, but I'm curious how the next few months will be for both of us, if you're a tenant here as well.

"Car was stolen/taken from dealership. What can I do? Location: Florida.

I dropped my car off at a dealership Tuesday morning for a problem it was having.  Thursday I got a call from the maintenance liaison describing what they found wrong, what they were going to do and that parts were being ordered. I gave them the okay for the repairs and I assume they ordered the parts. Since I own a very nice car, I have a device in my car that alerts me when the car starts and is parked, where it is, the route taken during trips, fuel efficiency, etc.  

Friday night I got a notification saying it was started. I thought it was weird since it was 7:30 p.m. and the dealership closes at 8.  Half an hour later, I get the notification that it is parked more than half an hour away from the dealership I left it at. A quick google search showed that it was a house.  I assumed it was a technician that took it home for the night because he didn't think anyone would notice it.  

I called the dealership to see why it was at a house and not the dealership; however, because it was so close to closing, I got a someone from the sales department and after not being able to find my car he said that they would be figuring it out tomorrow.  I told them that I was going to call the police and report it as stolen, as I did not give anyone at the dealership permission to take it home.  While I was getting things figured out with the police, the general manager called and tried to explain that sometimes a car needs to be taken home to diagnose it.  I explained to him that it had already been diagnosed and the last update that my liaison gave me was that they were waiting on parts.  He realized that the technician had taken it home without permission and a little less than an hour later my car had arrived back at the dealership.  

Is this theft? What type of precautions can or should I take to make sure nothing happened with my car while it was stolen by the technician?  How do I make sure that nothing goes unnoticed now that could become worse for the long term health of the car?  Do I have any real damages from the theft/unauthorized use of my car?

"Neighbor has missed 8 of 12 monthly payment for a loan I gave him. I had a travel trailer on my property near Dallas, tx.  He offered to buy it for $2000 in payments.  The agreement was to make $200 a month payments interest free until he pays it off and I give him title.

About 6 months in he asks me for title so he can sell it or give to his brother in law or something. I told him I need collateral.  So he gives me his wife's car title, which is worth about $2300.  I have his wife sign a blank bill of sale and sign the title as well with the next owner being blank.

He keeps telling me he will pay me, but after only making 4 payments and missing 8 payments I am at the point where I need to sell his wife's car or do something.  Even his wife said she would pay me and  I see her as being more reliable.  She has not paid either now.

I was thinking about just going to those title loan places and just getting out a title loan or something and just not pay it.  Not sure how to proceed.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

"Emergency pooped in fast food restaurant parking lot [California] So I did something extremely embarrassing and I’m not sure if I’ll be in any trouble. I get the sense that I’m okay, but I just need to double check.

After a late evening out, I was driving home, very close to or even at midnight. Suddenly, I felt an urgent need to use the bathroom. More specifically, to poop. I pulled over and looked for a fast food joint that I thought would be open and have a restroom I could use. 

I found one: a fast food burger restaurant. However, the dining area was closed and the employees did not let me in.

I then ran to a 7-11 in hope that they’d let me use their restroom. I knew they’d say no, but I had to try. In the past, I’ve tried to pay the cashier $20 to let me use whatever restroom they use but they declined so I didn’t try this time.

Desperate, I looked for ANYTHING that might be open and have a restroom near me. A grocery store, a gas station, anything. I found nothing. I rushed back to my car to make it home. I’ve had moments where I’ve had to use the restroom but have always been able to hold it, with some effort. 

This was not one of those cases. With poop certainly on the way out, I scrambled for a plastic bag or container of some sort. Nothing. Finally, I made a desperate decision: I pulled down my pants and pooped right outside my car, in a [fast food burger joint] parking lot. 

I had a towel in my car and tried to clean it up from the ground very quickly but there was definitely some left. Without any toilet paper, I pulled up my pants and left hastily. 

So given that I was in such a desperate situation, a) how likely is it that I get caught? I’m sure there are cameras around. I don’t know if anyone noticed me but I have to imagine someone would’ve said something in the time between me dropping my pants and then wiping it up off the ground if they had; b) if I am caught, what do I do? and c) i doubt this will ever happen to me again for the next 20 years at least, but if I’m in a situation like this, what do I do differently?

I’ve read a past post about this and I think people mostly felt like it was silly to worry about that and no one was going to do anything except maybe laugh.

So I am a bather for a dog grooming business in Texas (possibly important for tax reasons? I’m not sure) and we have a grooming salon and two mobile grooming vans. I am the bather that bounces pretty much everywhere, whether that be the salon, van #1, or van #2. 

So I won’t go into much detail but my boss is awful. However, if I became a groomer it would be worth all of the misery as I don’t make much and I drive about and hour to work and an hour back every day.

The highlight of my job is my coworker, now to be called Sam. Sam runs van #1 and that’s honestly where I get most of my hours. However, she doesn’t use me in the van as much as she needs because of one big issue:

My boss takes my hours out of her pay. 

So if I worked ten hours one day in the van, that’s eighty dollars out of Sam’s check, not from the business. If I’m in the shop, my boss pays the eight an hour, but not the van.

"Landlord Security Deposit Questions (Tennesee) Background: I moved into a house with a roommate who was previously living there for 2 years and we both started a new lease with the landlord with both of our names on it. The landlord is out of state and my roommate and I have never met him the entire time we have lived there. When we notified him we are terminating our lease to move out, he came by for a preliminary inspection approximately a month before we had to move out and sent us a checklist of items that he wanted to be done. Upon moving out, we cleaned the entire house to his checklist and he scheduled a mutual move out inspection with us the last day of the lease. The landlord, however, did not come to the inspection and wanted us to facetime him instead. After the facetime inspection, he said the house looked in good condition.

A new tenant moved into the house and complained to the landlord that the carpets were dirty and the house smelt like urine and had to have the place professionally cleaned. I took many pictures and the house did not smell when we left but my roommate did have a dog. My landlord wanted us to pay for the cleaning fees (approx $500). My roommate already agreed he would pay for the entire cleaning fee since it was from him and his dog. 

I have another 10 days until it is within the 30-day window for him to return my portion of the security deposit and the landlord is starting to say we have to pay for additional damages. I looked through the TN Tenant Codes and it states after 7 days of a new tenant moving in, the landlord waives his right do charge the previous tenant for any damages. The landlord also never notified me in writing where my security deposit was located upon signing the lease but I don't know how much I can prove it was not in a separate account.

Do I have the right to retain my full security deposit because of these two provisions even though he is trying to get us to pay for additional damages 7 days after a new tenant moving in but within the 30-day window he can keep my deposit?

"KS: Car Was Hit While Parked. The Police Officer Said Their ""System Was Down"" and I Won't Know Anything About the Drivers Insurance Until Monday. Should I Tow the Car Now or Wait? Hello,
I was visiting a friend today and an old woman hit my parked car.  The car is undrivable on the side of the road.  A police officer took down my info and the woman's info, but said that their ""system"" was down and he wouldn't be able to give me an accident report number until early this upcoming week.  Unfortunately the other driver did not have her insurance card on her.  The officer told me he would get her insurance info and call me, but it might take a couple of days.  
My car was legally parked, but when she hit it she pushed it onto the curb and about 6 inches in front of my friend's neighbors driveway.   It's not really in the way, but their neighbor isn't home so I haven't been able to explain the situation to them and I am worried they might have the car towed.  My friend is leaving for a few days, so he won't be able to talk to them either.
  
Assuming they DO have insurance (their car was registered, so they at least had insurance when they registered it), will I be able to get their insurance company to pay to tow it twice (once to my house to get it out of the way, and later to wherever I want it taken since it probably isn't salvageable)?  Will they reimburse me no matter which towing company I call?  On another note, I am out of a car right now...will their insurance company reimburse me for the uber rides I am having to pay for?  I've never been involved in an accident before, so I don't really know how any of this works.
Thanks!  
  
**Edit:**  I talked to my insurance company and they said that they wouldn't pay to tow my car unless the other driver was uninsured...which I won't find out for a few days.",legaladvice,t3_dk9ukn

"Employment / Labor related in Wisconsin co-worker assaulted me

So a coworker put his hands on me, came up from behind a grabbed my neck, and the gut reaction was to say “if you put your hands on my again I’ll knock you out.” I didn’t get up and threaten him. I stayed in my seat. And he continued to be a smug ass about it. We were both written up, because he put his hands on me and I threatened him. Work policy is anyone who assaults or threatens will be terminated. That didn’t happen and now things are weird in the office and it’s pretty hostile. I don’t trust him, and now, two months later, I was written up for “being rude” to him. I’m contesting this write up with HR because I feel like he has made this place hostile and is looking for any reason he can to get me fired.

I’ve obviously been looking for a new job because this is a toxic environment, but now that I was written up, I can’t even move to a different department.

"Misdiagnosis and a medical bill First of all, I know that many people will think that my case this a not big deal ($215 bill), because it could be worse, etc. For me, it is a big expense considering other medical bills and the fact that I was growing up in the country where the insurance= full coverage. 

I've had a spine issue since I was a child. I was treated, had many medical exams. The last radiologic exam was 2 years ago and showed a few issues with my spine. Pilates exercises really helped me with the pain. After I moved to the US I was only doing exercises only from time to time. 

One day after free outdoor yoga classes I couldn't stand up from the bed. I thought this was only a sore muscle due to a break in exercises. Unfortunately, the pain wasn't gone for 2 weeks and I decided to visit the chiropractor for the first time in my life. He helped me and listed almost all diagnoses that I was sure about before. He was able to tell me what's wrong under his fingers. In addition to confirm his diagnosis, he directed me to the Radiology center. People working in chiropractic register convinced me to talking in Radiologic center that my pain is unbearable, otherwise, their exam may be not covered by the insurance. I have UnitedHealthCare insurance and the Radiology center, which I visited, is in-network. Before the examination, I wanted to make sure that it will be covered by the insurance. I gave them my card and they convinced me to do not worry because it will be covered. I didn't lie about my pain because it was real. 

I've just received a bill:  Insurance will cover only $ 30, my balance is $215. So I pay monthly for UnitedHealthcare insurance and their coverage is even less than a half?  Is this is normal? I know I have to call them but first I wanted to get some advice here. 

The second thing is I got an incorrect and not full diagnosis regarding my health. In the exam description, it is written that I almost don't have problems. I know what is true and my pain is real. The previous radiologic exam from my country showed a number of diagnoses and I'm able to prove it because I've got those reports. The chiropractor was able to confirm my issues just under his fingers, but the expensive and professional medical equipment wasn't able to do that... What should I think? Isn't that ridiculous? 

 So I feel like I've been charged for the examination just because, in their opinion, I don't have severe issues.  I started to read more about this and discover that misdiagnosis is a fraud. I don't want to pay this bill I feel I've been cheated. What to do?",legaladvice,t3_dkdsi4

When I confronted her about this, she threatened to post the same content to my employer's social media channels, along with a made up story about how I subjected her to sexual and emotional abuse. Her stated goal was to get me fired from my job.  I took screenshots where she discusses her plan.

Although it has been a year since we were last together, she initiated not one, but two relationships with me.  She wanted to get back together even though I was already in another relationship, which she insisted I end, because of ""how pure"" our first relationship was (there were no allegations of abuse).  I never treated her with anything but the utmost respect.  I have lots of old texts to back this up.

"Louisiana: Landlord refuses to fix several items listed in lease as needing to be fixed / will be fixed. Can we withhold rent? What are our other options? When my wife and I moved we needed to move into a place immediately.  We were offered a run down trailer that needed LOADS of repairs.  These repairs were included in both the writing of the lease and in verbal communication between myself, landlord, landlords boyfriend (repairman) and my wife.  

The items included:  

A skirt around the trailer, this reduces heating and air conditioning costs.  Comparing our electric use to those of our immediate neighbors we are paying approx $100 more per month to heat during the 
winter and cool all summer.

A completely broken and unusable bathtub that has leaked below itself and rotted the floor.

Rotten cabinets in EVERY room,  seriously we have zero cabinet space cause not on cabinet in the entire house is usable.

Broken water heater:  my mother in law fixed this herself and we were “allowed” to deduct the cost from our deposit.

Leaking water pipes:  after two separate “handymen” came out to fix this and failed (we were having to turn our water off at the street cause we got a $200 plus water bill) my mother in law found and fixed the problem.

Electrical “problems”:  half of our electric outlets can not be used because as soon as one is used the breakers start to trip.  The following lists outlets that we have vs outlets we can use.

Kitchen:  3 have / 1 use
Living room: 4 have / 2 use
Children’s room: 2 have / 1 use
Main bedroom: 4 have / 3 use

The electric problems and the cabinets have had estimates done by professionals but no work has been done because the landlord stated that they cost too much.

The landlords exact words when we were discussing moving in were as follows:  “I’m going to use the money you give me each month for rent to make the repairs bit by bit”. Since then she has collected $5000 and has made no additional repairs.

TL:DR:  Landlord promised repairs in writing and has failed to do so for over 10 months.",legaladvice,t3_dk7r6q

"My *foreign* boyfriend's dad asked me replace his water-damaged US bills at a US bank. Can I do this? Hi fellow redditors, I'm in a pickle.

My boyfriend is from Macedonia and his father had around $13,000 in a box in his basement that got flooded and the money is now damaged. Sometime recently my boyfriend's father asked me to bring this money to the US to be replaced and bring it back. He told me that damaged currency (at least US dollars) can only be replaced in the country of origin, i.e. USA (and my research thus far confirms it). Is this legal for me to do?

Couple things I'm aware of:- I can only bring up to $10,000 in cash to the states without declaring it, so the full amount I would have to declare (if declaring it would cause any issues, I could in theory travel twice to bring the money in)- The father claims that the currency is damaged but not mutilated so, based on my research, this should be replaceable at any bank.

Is it legal for me to do this for him? My main concern is that I am not the actual owner of the money. Do I need some type of notarized letter from him that gives me permission to do this?

**EDIT based on comments:**

I'm aware that many details about this might seem suspicious, I am 99% not going to do this, but I want to be educated on the situation. I want to be aware of all potential avenues this can lead to so that I can explain to my boyfriend and his father why this cannot be done this way.

I would like to know if we assume that 1) both my boyfriend and his father cannot travel to US, 2) money is perfectly legal and 3) I bring in less than 10,000$, am I legally allowed to exchange that money even though it's not mine?

Also I am a citizen of Macedonia too, not US (I just have a work visa here).

**EDIT 2:**

Also, are there options for him to exchange the money somehow without coming to US?  


**EDIT 3 (as per comments asking to elaborate more on the origins of the money and why my boyfriend can't do this):**

Traveling to US in general is very difficult, especially if you're not from a rich country. Getting a visa to the US is quite hard (and an expensive risk) for a citizen of a country like Macedonia. Affording the flight is \~2 months worth of salary. I happen to have the fortune of having a good job in the states and travel documents but most people can only usually dream of coming to US. I know my boyfriend and family for decades now (we grew up in the same neighborhood). The reason they have dollars is because this entire region was historically notorious for inflation and the money has been lying in a basement for a decade (hence how it got damaged). His dad also doesn't trust banks in Macedonia (he grew up anti-communist in a communist system, there's a lot of history to this sentiment).  


Just to explain my point here again, I do not plan on doing this at this time (it sounds like there are better ways). However, I would like to be properly educated on this to be able to communicate with my boyfriend and his father on the proper steps to take.

"Life deed and ""landlord"" [Virginia] To start: my grandfather passed away, and as a result, my grandmother sold our family farm to his brother under a life deed.

A year later, I was invited to move in. I was in a rough place, my grandmother needed help around the house, etc. I do not know if J (the brother) was told beforehand or not, I assume so. However, I do know he found out soon, everything went fine.

I have now lived here for two years in March. He has spoken to me on this property and on the phone, knowing I live here. He has increasingly changed rules about the property, and I have abided them as I could and money allowed. No damage to the house, etc.; just ordering big things sometimes takes a lot of money, so I had to save. I am working on getting disability, so I do not have a lot of income.

Recently, he has taken to showing up unannounced, and complaining about random stuff around the farm - stuff that was fine before. He has taken to threatening me with legal action, calling the law, so forth, and told me this Friday I had to be out by Monday. He states because I am not on a lease, he doesn't have to give me thirty days.

Is this accurate? Given it is a life deed, does he even have say of me staying here to help my grandmother? Is he allowed to show up unannounced if it is a life deed?

I have offered to buy the farm from him, as it was originally to go to me anyway, etc. and no luck. I'm unsure what to do now, but my health isn't the greatest and this constant stuff is wearing me down.

UPDATE:  I have confirmed it is a life estate deed (found records online; my  grandmother is older, and has the beginning of dementia, so taking her  word for it is sometimes not advised).I am going to a lawyer on Monday.

I would argue that this falls under the educational exemption of Fair Use as they are meant to illustrate a scene from a movie that is being discussed and you’re currently looking out the window at, etc. Also, I would argue that the clips and overall experience is promoting the entire work rather than causing any sort of damages to it. We would of course avoid showing any overtly “spoilery” content that would negate the point of seeing the movie in its entirety. 

There’s a great deal of info out there about using movie clips in the context of a YouTube video or other social media, but I haven’t come across much in the way of guided tours. Thanks in advance for anything that could point us in the right direction!",legaladvice,t3_dkcg01
"[Nashville, TN, USA] Employer failed to pay and possible breach of contract? I am an hourly employees (with 4 separate pay codes; my wage varies by what work I'm doing that day). My employer has failed to pay me overtime on the highest rate of pay because ""it's not my regular hourly rate"". How do I determine which rate is my regular hourly rate? It seems nebulous at best.

Additionally, I fulfilled a work order for the same company that is paid to me at a flat rate. They claimed the work order was a mistake after I had completed the work, and are attempting to not pay me for the work I've already done. As far as I can tell, this is completely illegal, but I'm not sure the best way to proceed.

I would like clarification to the hourly rate dispute above, and I'm also wondering whether I should attempt to deal with them directly before taking them to small claims court, or if that would somehow hurt my case.

The letters have matching information of the debt I 'owe'. They state that there was a claim made against me from January 10, 2019 in California (where I am from and currently live). The thing is, I was living abroad at the time of the claim. I was living abroad for nearly two years up until August of this year.

I did a bit of research, and learned that both of these debt collectors are legit. I'm wondering if I should contact the debt collectors or USAA directly. If so, I want to have record of my contact, and was thinking I should send correspondence by email.

Location: California

During this beautiful day in the California Valley, my father went for his motorcycle ride . As he rode down the country highway and came up on a white car he waited for a clearing and attempted to pass on the left. Upon seeing the motorcycle to his left the driver sped up as fast as he could, but he was too late and my dad had already passed. The driver was furious, chasing my father off the highway and down a side road until, BAM! He hit my fathers back tire and he slid out. My father calling 911 as he gets up sees the driver pulling over to exchange information. The cops arrive and my dad tells the what has happened, but they don't take the man into custody. my father is currently being checked out by the hospital and the driver is chilling at home.

-	our neighbors told us that they had put gravel at the bottom of our shared driveway  since their new Porsche is unable to drive across the dip
-	they told us the government will fix the dip and the gravel is temporary
-	it’s been 3 months and the government hasn’t fixed the dip
-	one of my family members has started to bike to work (because the workplace is nearby and exercise)
-	she recently started having trouble getting out due to the gravel as well as the neighbors garbage bins which are close to the driveway
-	we’ve asked them to move the trash bins farther from the driveway which they have but only for 2 weeks or so
-	a solution would be to buy a permanent cover which will replace the gravel and benefit both. 
-	said family member has come up with an ultimatum which which will be to tell the neighbors that either they deal with their car situation on their own and remove the gravel or she’ll remove the gravel herself for her safety

the question is are we legally allowed to shovel said gravel away or not?",legaladvice,t3_dkc5y7
"Work contract/Lease contract with shady termination clause. I am in desperate need of help reddit. My mother not too long ago (on the April of this year) signed what she believed to be an employment contract to work in a hairdressing salon as a cosmetologist while she is in school as a way to gain experience and apply what she has learned, and then eventually begin working full-time once she got her license.

Her Employer (we'll call her Sarah) was very welcoming in the beginning and told her she'll be working with a 40/60 split of commission where as 40% is my mother's pay and 60% is Sarah's. English not being my mother's first language and her being too trusty, she signed without carefully reading the agreement. The contract is for 4 years.

She's been working in Sarah's Salon on her off days from class alongside another employee (let's call her Jane). Sarah explains to my mother that all appointment customers belong to Jane or Sarah herself, and she can only take care of walk-in customers, also part of her responsibilities include cleaning up the place before leaving the salon.

Based on what my mother has described, she's working as a janitor without barely any walk-in customers, and Jane asserts that nearly all customers are 'appointments'. She wanted to end her contract, and after asking Sarah countless times for the copy of her contract, she finally was able to take pictures of Sarah's phone that had pictures of the contract.

There's an early termination clause which reads that my mother would be responsible to reimburse Sarah for $6,400 per the 80 hour training she received at a cost of $80. My mother has received a total of 3 to 4 hours of explanation of how things work there, and she is receiving her cosmetology training in her own school. In the past months, my mother have made a total of $400 from her commission and tips. I currently live with her as living with her was far cheaper than college dorms for me.

In this 'Lease' contract, there's a lot of grammar issues, inconsistencies and other deceptive and manipulative clauses that makes no sense so I am asking for your advice. Is this Lease agreement even legal? Would this hold true in case Sarah brings this to court? We are currently in VA state and I figured I reach out to you guys before trying to find a lawyer which I am not sure we can afford at the moment.

"Porch pirates keep stealing thousands of dollars.(Florida) So as the title implies I have a very reoccurring problem with porch pirates. I live in a very small town with little in the way of stores for shopping, so I tend to order things online. I work a job at night so I'm pretty much always home during the day when most of my packages come albeit sleeping or doing yardwork in my backyard. So usually the delivery guy puts my package on the porch and it only sits there for couple hours at most. Because this happens so frequently I did invest in a camera over my door which sends me alerts when it catches movement so whenever it goes off I am either greeted by the mailman with my packages or a random person who also has my packages. If it's the latter it almost always devolves into me chasing them around the block for a while yelling at them to give me my packages back in my gator print boxers in classic Florida man fashion,  getting my packages back by them dropping them or me catching up to them and then walking back home. I'm not a very fit person so having to do this almost 2-3 times a month is exhausting and it seems like my house has more pirates than south Africa. They are always different people too and a camera although sometimes catches a face doesnt bring me my packages back or catch whoever's got it. It's really just a glorified starting whistle at this point. I did recently purchase a firearm and hold a concealed carry license although I've never used it because I dont plan on shooting anyone over some electronic parts.

This evening he drove to our house (stayed off our property, but he's looking into our yard). My dad and fiance are outside working on my car. My dad says to him  ""go home, nosey"" the neighbors barks back ""you need to clean up your yard"" my dad says ""you need to go home before I punch you in the face"". My neighbor then pulls a gun on my dad and says ""I have the right to defend myself"" (he clearly knows the law and is careful to not break it. he waited for my dad to threaten him, stayed off our actual property, ect). The cops get called and 15 minutes later, we find out that our neighbor isn't going to jail because my dad threatened him first. The officer is leaving it in the prosecuting attorney's hands.

My question is to people who really KNOW the law... this isn't the first time this guy has initiated a fight with my father. The background is there as far as harrassment goes. We've had to call the police on him before.

Now I know that my dad threatened him but my neighbor clearly came to our house to initiate a fight. 

I'll be meeting with the prosecuting attorney Monday. My dad is getting a restraining order as well.

"Debt collection agency wants payment for broken lease, original creditors have no record of broken lease I broke a lease in June, and the money I owed got sent to a collections agency.

Fast-forward to today, I call the original creditor to inquire about one of the charges in the list of what I owed provided by the debt collector. The apartment complex tells me that they changed property management companies last month, and that **they have nothing on file about me breaking a lease or owing money.** At this point I don't know if I should contact the debt collector, try to verify or dispute the debt, or contact the property management company. My fear is that if I do the latter, a debt that otherwise would've slipped through the cracks would now be increased or enforced.

On the lease, and per the landlord, rent is to be paid in cash. I tried to Google stuff but it's been too complicated for me to find.

Does she legally have to provide a receipt? If I were to go to the store and buy those receipt papers, and ask her to start signing them for me, does she HAVE to comply even if it's for my own sake?

Also, could I get accused of not paying rent even though I have been paying because there's no proof? Other than me withdrawing the cash from my bank? Her lease specifically states that I pay her rent in cash, but nothing about a receipt.

"Overtime Hours- Is this Illegal? (United States) Hello everyone,

I am employed by a moving and storage company as a commercial vehicle driver (Non-CDL, Class C license). This company is small and independently owned, but is also an “agent” for a larger interstate and international relocation company (The largest of these companies include United Van Lines, Mayflower, Atlas, and Allied Van Lines). Being an “agent” for a larger moving company means that we also receive and deliver shipments of household goods that were packed and driven to our local warehouse by workers from other smaller “agents” or by the parent company itself. This larger “parent company” also books jobs for our smaller “agent” company that might be within our local range or just outside of it. 

So this means that sometimes I am either completing a job that was booked by the smaller “agent” company, or by our larger “parent” company. Most of the time, I am completing a job for the smaller “agent”, as I do not have a certification to transport household goods for the larger “parent” company.

Here is where the problem begins,

When I look at my paycheck, which is always signed and payed by the smaller “agent” company, my hours can be split into two categories, one as hours for the smaller company, and one as hours for the larger company. This results in me sometimes losing a significant amount of overtime sometimes, and my fellow coworkers have noticed the same thing. It is also sometimes unclear whether the job we are working on is for the smaller or larger company. Collectively, we are all also suspicious that sometimes are employer “moves hours around” so that they don’t have to pay as much overtime.

I hope this is clear enough to make any sense.

"Questions regarding salaried employment in Michigan My husband is a manager of small shop that's part of a much larger company (company has thousands of employees). He had 3 employees under him, but they have all since quit and the company is having trouble replacing them. (They quit back in June or July.) The location is supposed to have around 6-7 employees.

As a result, my husband is working 60-80 hours a week, 7 days a week with no coverage for lunch or breaks.

Originally he was hourly and getting overtime with a small quarterly bonus (~10% of his earnings every 3 months). But after his first paycheck the company made him salary instead, with a small raise (~4%). They also raised his quarterly bonus a bit (~16% of his earnings every 3 months). He makes just a bit over the minimum wage for salaried employees in Michigan without the bonuses.

The quarter came and went last month without a bonus. He's also had to cancel all his future time off because he's the only one working there.

Is there a limit to the number of hours a salaried employee is required to work?

How long can a company hold a bonus before playing it out? He's asked them about getting his bonus for weeks, and the only answer is that they are looking into it.

Can you be salaried and still receive overtime?

How long can a company work a salaried employee before giving them time off?

From what I've been able to research, it doesn't look like the company has to pay him the bonus, can work him as many hours as they want, doesn't need to give him time off, and doesn't have to pay him overtime.

"Is it against the law to ""distract from the pledge""? I'm a highschool student in the US (Alabama) here wondering if its really against the law to distract others from the pledge. Let me say in advance that I know my first amendment rights as far as being able to protest the pledge in school.

Friday morning I left class to get my laptop charger 5 minutes before the bell rang. The bell rang while I was walking back down the hallway that my classroom is in, which promptly started the pledge of allegiance. I kept walking because I didn't want to be too late since we were doing something important, and i was only about 5 or 6 feet away from my classroom. Its really important to note that this hallway was nearly empty: there was one girl a ways ahead of me and two teachers at the very end of the hallway. One of those teachers yelled at me to stop walking. I ignored her and kept walking, which I was right in front of my classroom now. She yelled at me again and I stopped and said ""you can't make me"". In the middle of saying this to her, the pledge stopped and the moment of silence was happening. I walked back into my class and sat down. What I did made this teacher really mad, so she barrelled down the hallway and into my class to yell at me. I'm not submissive by any means, so I was very angry and disrespectful towards her. 

She called an administrator (basically just the vice principal) and he came in and took me out of class. His reasoning for writing me up was that I basically just broke the law by distracting others from the moment of silence by quietly walking down a near empty hallway. He didn't think that this teacher distracted anyone during the moment of silence, only me.

The location may fall under the FLSA due to selling items on Amazon, though not all workers all involved with that portion of the business. It is well under 15 employees. They do pay at least minimum wage but no overtime. 

Is this an issue of labor law or an issue of false advertising on the website or both (or neither)?",legaladvice,t3_dkf8w3
"How to Gain Guardianship of Disabled Adult From Their Spouse Two years ago my wife's uncle had a massive cardiac arrest and as a result has severe brain damage and is disabled. His wife threw him in a nursing home and doesn't bother visiting him despite living a few minutes away. Multiple times he had to be sent to the ER from the nursing home and she can't even be bothered to show up, even to answer questions from the healthcare staff.

The last straw was last night when she called us at 10:30 wanting us to go to the hospital because he was sent to the ER again and said she was unable to get there. Today we find out the reason she couldn't be bothered to go see her husband was because she was at a haunted house with friends.

We don't think she should have custody of her husband anymore. My in-laws (wife's parents/sibling of uncle) want guardianship. How would we go about getting that done? We live in Missouri if that's a factor. Is it a matter of petitioning for guardianship in the court?
