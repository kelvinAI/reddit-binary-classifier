"(F18) Hit my head off a nail in the wall repeatedly while I was sleep walkingAge: 18
Sex: Female
Weight: 115 lbs
Height: 5’5

Back in 2016, I slept over at my friends house. In the middle of the night, I began sleep walking around the room. My friend told me I then proceeded to hit my head repeatedly off a spot on the wall where a nail was sticking out of. Anyways, I woke up that morning with a horrible bruise above my eyebrow and very dizzy. However, I never got it checked out or told my parents because I was young and silly.
The reason i’m concerned is because to this day, i still experience pain whenever i move my eyebrow or squint my eyes. I also have a noticeable gap above my eyebrow. Sometimes at night when i’m laying down, a bump will form around the gap, and it will inflamed .  I’m not sure if i should get this checked out. Any concerns?

"[29F] Fell on ribs a month ago, xray showed no breaks, extremely sore todayLast month, I tripped and fell on my torso over a toilet seat in the morning. My left side was in excruciating pain and I could not lie on my back that night; I slept in a chair. I went to an urgent care unit the next day and they took x-rays and found no break. This happened when I was at Universal Studios, so I toughed it out and went on some rides that day (every pain killer under the sun + ice).

One week later, bruising showed up on the other side of my body and my other rib started to hurt more.

For two weeks, I wasn't able to sleep on either side of my body. Even up until now, it hurts to sneeze or cough, or roll over on either side. 

Yesterday, I was sitting on the floor, leaning forward to clean out a cupboard. I felt a sudden pain on the left side of my torso. Not as bad as the day I fell, but as bad as ~ four days after the fall. More of my side hurts -- the pain goes further towards my back now than it did before. I put ice on it and took ibprofen then and had to stop cleaning. It still hurts a lot this morning. It hurts when I sneeze, cough, or breathe very deeply (but not normal breaths).

I am leaving my job at the end of this week, moving this weekend, and starting a new job on Monday. I really don't have time to go to my primary doctor right now.

**Questions**: 

Do you think my ribs are broken or just bruised? 

Do you think this could just be a muscle pull/strain? 

Besides ice and ibprofen, is there anything else I should be doing to recover? I have movers coming to help with the heavy lifting, but I still need to clean and pack.

It doesn't feel like the muscle is weak and it only hurts when stretching, twisting or holding a weight (any amount).

"(24M) A really bad reaction to Sertraline for anxiety - what's next?I have been suffering really badly with anxiety for about a year. While I've always been am anxious person, I had a major ""episode"" last December that resulted in about 4 months of daily struggling. I went to the doctors and was prescribed 2mg diazepam to take as and when things got really bad. Just knowing I had the diazepam there for emergencies actually settled my mind a lot, and around March of this year, things started to look up. I got a new job that I enjoyed and spent most of the summer anxiety free. 

Fast forward to around 2 weeks ago, and my contact with work came to an end. My mental health deteriorated and I started having intrusive thoughts and daily, debilitating anxiety. My only respite was evening times, when I was tired enough to fall asleep. My old job offered me a new position, and not wanting to start back in an unhealthy place, I went to back to the doctors and was prescribed 50mg of Sertraline (Zoloft) to help with the anxiety. Within two days of taking the sertraline, my anxiety increased tenfold. I was unable to rest, relax or sit still. I was so nauseous that I was throwing up and the worst symptom was that it felt like my entire nervous system was on fire - physically, it was one of the most uncomfortable sensations I have ever felt. I was twitchy and shaking and unable to relax or sleep. I ended up being taken to the hospital by my girlfriend and given more diazepam, which I have been taking (around 10mg a day) since then (which was around 4 days ago). It has taken 4 days for the physical symptoms to calm down, and while they are not totally gone, I can relax a little bit easier. At first, the diazepam did very little, but is now relaxing me. 

So, backstory out of the way, my question is this: what is my next step medication wise? My anxiety is worse than ever and now I'm afraid to try a different SSRI. While I understand that some people react to different types of SSRIs differently, I can't shake the feeling that the negative symptoms I had were related to my brain not agreeing with the method of action of the drug, rather than a reaction to sertraline specifically. If it makes any difference, I (stupidly) used to take a lot of drugs when i was younger, MDMA especially, and the physical symptoms I had were similar to those of a bad comedown. 

Sorry for the long post but I'm hoping someone here can offer some insight.

Duration of complaint 7 months

Location (Geographic and on body) GI? 

Any existing relevant medical issues (if any) Elevated LFTs and potassium, low albumin, neutropenia

Current medications (if any) N/A

This is long so I will try to condense it as much as possible...

Has had a chronic vomiting situation going on since approx 2 weeks old. 10+ episodes a day, no obvious triggers.

Tested for plyoric stenosis, delayed emptying, esophageal webbing,  had a cranial ultrasound, upper GI x-ray,  fatty oxidation disorders, upper endoscopy, and manometry study.

No trouble feeding.

At 12 weeks he had lost 6oz in 6 days and was put on concentrated Elecare. We then ended up in the ER because his vomiting episodes followed with bouts out lethargy. We were sent home because 'all babies puke' ended up back there the next day and they ran labs. All were unremarkable except his ALT was in the 800s , AST was in the 600s, and Albumin was 2.8. He was admitted to the hospital and tested for everything under the sun. Positive for EBV (assumed placental transfer) and positive for rhinovirus. His albumin continued to drop and his Potassium started to rise. They eventually ran an ng tube for 4 days until he started gaining weight and the LFTs decreased.  We were told that 'sometimes this just happens'

In July he had some kind of upper respiratory bug and had an instance of choking while vomiting. He had a color change so we were advised to head to the ER to check for aspiration. We asked for a CMP, ALT came back approx 65, but his ANC was .7.

Since then his ANC has fluctuated between .7 and 2.3. Hematology ran an antibody test to check for autoimmune neutropenia, it was negative.

Two weeks ago we noticed a rash on his stomach that we and his pediatrician attributed to his constant state of moisture. Over the next week and a half the rash spread and changed. Originally it looked almost like bug bites in size, then changed into small blackish red marks all over his legs the size of pin pricks. Had one instance of white stool, then changed to clay colored. 

He had a standing lab order for a CBC with differential and a CMP. ALT 207, AST 154, Potassium 5, ANC 1.1. The rash then spread to his arms and looked like red pen pricks. Spent the night in the ER where they couldn't give us any more than 'He's a mystery...it's likely something viral'. They ran another CBC and CMP...ANC increased to 1.3 and his LFTs came down a little bit.

He's seen a GI team and a hematology team. His pediatrician is wonderful but we're totally lost.

I recently had an outbreak of cold sores on my neck - a rather large patch of them. I then got more cold sores around my ear.
But what I'm asking about is why I'm getting cold sores in such odd places? Is it a perhaps different type of HSV1 to the ones you get around the mouth? (They look and act the same though)

Also why do I feel SO incredibly awful every time I have one?
It feels like I have the flu, I ache even more, I get pain in my left leg for some weird reason, I have more brain fog and it just generally makes all of my CFS symptoms incredibly worse.

Background: I've had cold sores since I was a baby (I had eczema herpeticum). I've had them around my lips and nose, on my fingers, near my eyes, around my ears, on my forehead, on my ears, they've even developed in patches of acne before too. They no longer respond to Acyclovir, and I take quite a high dose of Valaciclovir for it to really work (1g 3 times a day for 7 days). I get them frequently, often more than one in a row at a time.

Any other medical problems?- Iron def anemia and asthma.

Complaint?- flakes of blood in urine in the morning time
Duration of complaint- Started this Saturday.

Ok, so Saturday morning, I saw drops/flakes of blood in my urine. I was shocked and maybe thought my period was coming so I ignored it. No more blood came that day and I just that maybe a mishap inside my body happened. Next, on Sunday morning, I saw a tiny drop and ignored it again, thinking maybe another mishap happened. Finally though, today,  I saw two penny sized flakes/drops. I know a UTI can sometimes cause blood in urine, but this isn’t mixed in with my urine. My urine isn’t cloudy or extremely dark either. And this problem only happens in the morning, as far as I know. I haven’t seen it any other time of day. At first I thought that maybe it was ovulation bleeding but then I figured it wouldn’t be going on for this long. My period is also a few months late (I think I have PCOS) but I’m definitely not pregnant. I also definitely cannot have an STD/STI. I am paranoid about it being some sort of cancer (bladder, cervical etc) but I have no other symptoms other then the tiny amount of blood in the morning. No pain or anything. Anyway, if it doesn’t go away by Friday, I will ask my parents to take me to the doctors (unless it’s urgent) but could anyone tell me what this might be?

"[210[M] Increased GI Distress Vomiting Small AmountsHeight: 6'0""

Weight: 225lbs.

Race: White

Over the past few months, I've noticed two things: I've been burping more frequently, which I never used to do, and occasionally that will bring a bit of vomit to the back of my throat.  Furthermore, twice now, it has been strong enough to actually force a little bit of vomit out of my mouth randomly.  The first time this happened about 3 weeks ago, not long after bending over to get my shoes, but not immediately after bending over.  The second time was today, after bending over to wash my legs in the shower.  Both times were not long after exercising (running both times I think, approximately 2.5-3 miles).  The general increase in burping and the like has been going on for about 8 months now, but that's a \*very\* rough estimate because, until recently, I didn't pay much attention to it.

I don't really feel much GI distress otherwise (not too much bloating, no pain or soreness, no sore throat or sickness).  My appetite is normal as well. 

Existing medication: Zoloft, 150mg, daily, for anxiety.

I do not smoke.  I also don't usually drink in excess, though it's not unusual for me to have a glass of wine, maybe two, at night while watching TV or eating dinner.  I've never thrown up from a night of drinking.  I am also a vegetarian, and my dietary staples include roasted carrots, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts; ""healthy"" (though that's debatable) granola/cereal (Great Grains/Special K); and rice/bean dishes.  My biggest long-term vice is nighttime snacking.  In addition to a dinner and small dessert, I may also have a bowl of cereal and some popcorn later on.  Just carbs in general.  I try to limit it, but picture 700 calories of cereal/peanut butter/etc. on a pretty bad night.

My period just ended 2 days ago, and usually my breasts swell uniformly and both get tender at the beginning of my period, not after it. And i have never felt this large lump before.

Dr. Google says that it's probably a cyst because it hurts and usually cancerous lump wouldn't hurt.

"Are these hemorrhoid systems or something else? Condition has been pretty consecutive for about a year.Age: 33

Sex: M

Height: 5'6“

Weight: 156lbs

Race: Caucasian 

Duration of complaint: ~ 1 year

Location: Rectum/perinium 

Any existing relevant medical issues: None

Current medications: Hemorrhoid cream, hydrocortisone cream. 

At the risk of sharing TMI, I want to be thorough in what I'm experiencing. About a year ago my rectum has become very itchy and sore. At times, my perinium would become itchy as well. Hydrocortisone cream will usually take care of it, and if I apply it for a few days consecutively it'll make the problem go away for a week or so and then return. I don't think hemorrhoid cream has proven very helpful.

I don't see anything on the outside of my anus, but it seems like the itching and pain generally comes from just barely inside my rectum. After wiping from a bowel movement, I regularly have smears of bright red blood. Again, not to share TMI but I feel it may be relevant, when it's really bothering me those first couple of wipes feel *so* ridiculously good. It's like the ultimate scratch of that itch you've never got to in your life.

At times I'll get what I can only describe as small tears or cracks in the skin on my perinium, but this hasn't happened in months. It's very painful when it does, and I suspect this is from too vigorous wiping when my rectum is really itching/hurting.

Could it just be internal hemorrhoids, and if so, do they last that long consecutively? Like I said, I've been dealing with it nearly nonstop for about a year. It hasn't gotten worse or better in that time. I travel for work and so finding and getting in to see a GP is really difficult.

"Scaphoid fracture (non-displaced) - in cast - one week in - exercise and other advice (33M).I  sustained a scaphoid fracture a week ago when falling off my bike. I  had it seen that evening and then put in a splint, then went back the  following morning after the pain got worse. An x ray confirmed a  scaphoid fracture (to my eyes it looked on the X-ray as if a little  chunk was missing from the bone, rather than it being split in two or  fractured from one side to the other). I was put in a short arm plaster  cast and told to get it seen two weeks later to remove the cast, X-ray  again to check up on progress and apply a fiberglass cast for a further  four weeks.

I have been a bit down  about it since it was four days into a week long cycle tour and of  course it has screwed with a lot of the plans I had - and it hurts! I  know from the initial talks with the doctor and reading up on it that  complications can be  nasty so I want to make sure I do what I can to  heal well while trying to approach this with a positive mentality.

My  main doubt is how much exercise I should do and of what kind. This  definitely helps me stay on an even keel psychologically so it is  important. Also, I know that circulation can be an issue for this bone  so getting blood pumping must be a good thing. OTOH, I want to avoid  risking any more trauma to the injury. So what about running in the  park, for instance? Or strength training other parts of my body in the  gym (other arm / legs)?

Gastro doc didn't think my stomach pain was purely reflux. Scope showed that except for benign stomach polyps (from long-term ppi use), my stomach is fine and Barrett's is very small now, grade B esophagitis. Celiac was ruled out and ultrasound was done last year and this year, both showing a large growing 3cm gallstone. Ultrasound results say the stone is 3 cm in diameter (increased from 1 yr ago), calcified, and not mobile. Gallbladder wall thickness is upper limits of normal. Sludge in the fundus. Common bile duct is 2mm. Hypoechogenicity in proximal body of the gland, but variable and might be due to overlying shadow or mass.  

Met with surgeon and she said that the size of the gallstone is reason enough to remove my gallbladder, but it's up to me since my pain can't be definitively linked to my gallbladder. There's a risk the large stone will cause a fistula and travel to and obstruct my intestine (gallstone ileus), and also a higher risk of gallbladder cancer. I've never had an attack though and I'm used to the pain. Surgeon said it's up to me whether to get it removed.

"(21F) Am I normal and healthy? Circulation issues, bad cough, can't burp, etc.This post is a manifestation of my anxieties and I am aware that I am probably overthinking and being dramatic. Sorry. 

5'9"", 105lbs, white. I occasionally drink, I don't smoke cigarettes but do smoke weed and partake in psychedelic mushrooms. I occasionally take antibiotics for UTI's and allergy medicine. I also have an IUD. 

I'm constantly worried about my health, mostly because my mom had a stroke at a VERY young age and because I have such an odd collection of health issues. These fears are probably just because of my bad anxiety and I'm probably fine, and yes, I am seeing a therapist about my anxiety. I have panic attacks fairly regularly. 

Here's everything that's wrong with me:

* I can't burp. See r/noburp for more information. 
* I get colds multiple times a year, and they destroy my work and social life for close to a month sometimes. I think I've gotten more and more colds as I get older. When I'm sick Im constantly swallowing mucus and because I can't burp, it causes me lots of pain in my stomach and I end up needing to vomit air constantly. 
* I have bad seasonal allergies. Can allergies in the fall and spring increase my chances of contracting a cold? If I get some strong allergy medicine that I take every day do you think I'll get colds less frequently?
* I have asthma, so when I get a cold I get a persisting cough for months. After a coughing fit my hands go numb, twitch, and I have trouble moving them, and my eyes twitch. My visions will sometimes go dark around the edges. Is this from a lack of oxygen? My cough gets so bad I vomit very often just from triggering my gag reflex. I went to a doctor about this once and they gave me prescription cough medicine that didn't seem to help much. My coughing fits are getting so bad that I'm worried about my safety when driving my car. And it's effecting my school attendance. I have an inhaler but I feel like it doesn't help. 
* I get very frequent UTI's if I have sex more than once in a day, or if I don't shower that day. I get them so often that I can feel the very early signs of one so I take cranberry pills immediately and drink lots of water and don't even bother going to a doctor. 
* I think i have chilblains. My toes get swollen, red, itchy, and hurt a lot in the winter. 
* I think I'm unhealthily skinny, but I feel like I eat a lot? I don't have the most healthy eating habits (fast food occasionally, and I really like sugary things). I haven't gained weight since early high school. 
* I don't really exercise at all because my knees hurt a lot after a short jog, and I get weezy from the asthma, and for some reason exercise makes the pain from not being able to burp worse. 

I have an irrational fear of having circulation issues that could lead to a stroke, since my mom had one very young. Could my chilblains, lack of oxygen after coughing, thin-ness, and UTI's be early issues of a more serious problem?

"Extreme difficulty swallowing solid food but not in esophagus, in upper throat. 24/m

Male, 230 pounds, caucasian, 24

Hello, so for about a month now I’ve had difficulty swallowing solid foods. It’s as if I have forgotten how to swallow even small amounts of food. The food goes to the back of my mouth and just sits there. I have to grit my teeth and clench my hands to force my body to do the swallowing motion. I’m very scared. I have some growths at the back of my mouth and am going to see my gp soon, but fear I’ve developed cancer. Basically the issues are around the epiglottis area, the actual esophagus doesn’t seem to have any issue. I can swallow liquids no problem usually. I’m eating less and very worried. My swallowing reflex seems very weak. At least for solid foods. I’m miserable. What should I ask for when I see my GP? He seems to think it’s psychosomatic. I can swallow liquid at a somewhat decent pace, but it’s not as fast as it used to be and I had seen an ENT recently, I was having these issues but not as bad, and I worry it is some sort of degenerative thing. I’ve had anxiety for years, bad anxiety, but this is new and terrifies me. 

A great grandparent had MS. I brought this up to my GP and he said he’d never heard of inability to swallow as a first symptom of MS. But he didn’t put me at ease either. If it’s not that, what is causing it? Dentist appoinments could help but I have no money to afford it. I was told a speech therapist could somehow help?

Even when I have no food in my mouth at all I have difficulty swallowing. I’m just sitting here in bed trying to swallow and having to force it.

Earlier I chewed some roast beef and it was almost a liquid and I couldn’t make my stupid mouth do the swallowing motion. I feel like I’m going to aspirate it.

I don’t know why liquids don’t usually cause an issue.

"Weakness, confusion, and exhaustion and sexual issues. I’m confused and not sure what to do.I’m female, 23. I weigh about 155 pounds and sit at 5 foot 7

I have high blood pressure and bipolar disorder. The high blood pressure has been rising steadily over the last two years or so, especially because I have always heard nurses and doctors mentioning my blood pressure being high for my age. Bipolar disorder is pretty self explanatory. 


I take Lamictal 200 mg
Seroquel 25 mg (for sleep)
Prazosin 2 mg

I started prazosin in August because my psychiatrist noted me having high blood pressure over the last year of being treated for bipolar disorder. (It doesn’t help that I went to the hospital before being on prazosin and had a blood pressure of 158/90) 

Ever since I started it two months ago, I take it at night a couple hours before bed. I feel weak and exhausted when I wake up, and congested. I didn’t feel like this until I stated on prazosin. He did warn me it can make me faint upon standing and cause dizziness. 

I wake up every morning feeling exhausted and tired. I can’t take it during the day because my vision gets so bad, meaning it stays black and I get tunnel vision, and feel a sense of immense weakness where I can’t even hold myself up without issues.

The congestion didn’t start until a couple weeks after taking this medication. But I’m not sure if that is linked or not but it’s really, really bad morning congestion.


I’m going to include other things from my past, too. I don’t even know if the weakness is linked to prazosin, as I have had earlier periods of weakness over the year but it is really exacerbated/ noticed (when I first really noticed it) on prazosin. 

In the past I have had some issues, nothing too extreme.
At age of 5, I had kidney stones. Passed one but still have back and flank pain, and have had some pee in my blood once before about almost two years ago.

Sleep apnea as a baby. (I’m not sure if I ever outgrew it or still have it, honestly. I do snore and have woke up feeling I didn’t get enough air and have occasionally felt myself stop breathing and gone a good bit without breathing and have had to remind myself to breathe) 

At 12, I had a severe staphylococcus (spelling?) infection which was promptly treated (luckily it was not MRSA). 
13, I had appendicitis like symptoms (but did not show appendicitis) and still have them periodically. 

Lately, however, I have had immense issues having sex. I have a history of UTIs. However this isn’t that, I’ve had many of those and know what it is. Lately when it comes to having sex. Penetration hurts, and it hurts inside. I’ve had changes to my menstural cycle. (Went from 28 day cycle to 35+, but it can be linked to lamictal).

Basically, I’m exhausted sometimes, despite enough sleep. I feel weak and dizzy a lot of the time. I have severe nausea in periods that come and go, sometimes heart burn, menstural changes (can be linked to meds?) and it hurts to have sex. 

I don’t know if this is linked or not and I’m just looking for advice on what to do or be checked for at this point.",AskDocs,t3_dl0hq0

Sex: F

Weight :52kg

Height: 5""2

Medical issues: coeliac disease, psoriasis

non drinker/smoker

Hi everyone, just wanted some advice on where to go please. Yesterday my ear just randomly popped and ever since then it has hurt. It felt clogged and then that night I had an earache. It ended up getting severely bad, it wasn't just my ear, it was like my jaw, and the bones around my ear too. Even my teeth were hurting, it feels like I have a toothache in my ear.

I went to the doctor and he looked at it and it is clear, no ear wax stuck, no infection, nothing built up. He told me to take just painkillers. Thing is, I didn't have pain when he touched around but I had already taken 2 painkillers so I don't know if that is why. The pain gets so bad that I have to hold my ear.

I now notice when I have hot/cold drinks on that side it gets worse. But the thing is I shouldn't have any holes, I brush my teeth, and I have been to the Dentist not long ago. I even checked myself and there is no holes. Normally if I get a hole it hurts severely bad on one tooth only. This certain pain doesn't even always hurt around where my teeth are, it hurts in my ear, and along my jaw on the left side. I do have a lump on my jawline I forgot to mention, it started about a month ago. Don't know if it's lymph node or what.

I am seeing another Dr on Thursday, should I book the dentist before then? It just doesn't make sense because, my ear popped, then the pain started immediately. It's not like it came over time or I woke up with it. It wasn't there 1 second, then the next second it was.

I don't know if it something to do with my jaw and it is radiating to my ear or what. I originally thought it is my ear but then there are times it is the bones behind my ear and next to it on my face. And even painkillers don't help, the most they'll do is ease it for 10-20minutes.

I've always been a poor sleeper.  Falling asleep has been hard my entire life.  It always takes 1+ hours to fall asleep, and staying asleep requires eye masks and earplugs.  Nothing I've done helps.  I stay off of devices for over an hour before sleep, usually reading, exercising has no significant effect, and I've tried most every method my family's GP has suggested, even things like dissolved magnesium.  

Falling asleep and staying asleep are always horrible, but recently it's been far worse.  It's affecting my studies and mental health.

Often what blocks my sleep is thoughts.  Often times when trying to fall asleep for the first time each night, I do so by practicing a type of mindfulness - flame and void method.  I don't think this helps, but I'll eventually be able to fall asleep more often than not.  The problem comes once I wake up, which I do frequently (at least 2x a night).  Once trying to fall back asleep, I find it extremely difficult.  I'll often be unable to relax my mind, continuing whatever type of dream I had before waking up - this often ends up being something that takes active thought, which prevents me from falling asleep.  The worst problem is that I seem unable to change my thoughts at this point.  Recently, I started trying to read for a few minutes before trying to sleep again whenever this happens, but this only has about a 33% success rate.

I am a 42 year old male. I was bitten by a tic during my basic military training. Went to a medic for removal. Should have done it myself because I removed tics on weekly basis from our wiener dog.
That was in 1997 in Western Germany.
The medic had difficulties getting the tic out, maybe parts of the head remained.
There wasn't a significant amount of redness around the bite mark, maybe some redness for 2 or 3 cm in diameter (1 inch). 
I had no further symptoms but haven't been checked for borreliosis. 
In the last decades, the area where I was bitten swells up and starts to itch. 
This only lasts for a couple of hours and then disappears.

I feel all alone, weak, and have dreams where I can’t run and I’m always falling, and my BODY does things I don’t want it to and speaks when i don’t want it to. I feel trapped in my own body. I also get dreams that always come true, it’s like I have a sixth sense, I told people about it. I dreamed my cousin will die of cancer and he did, and i was able to do nothing. I have dreams of small things and they always came true. I would also tell my parents but I don’t know how to tell them because i will mentally breakdown because I always wanted to make them happy but it feels like I can’t do anything and all I can do is watch a bad part of me.

My doc ordered a thyroid blood test a little over a month ago, he said that I was just under what he considered to be abnormal, but a bit higher than the lab's ""normal"" level.  So he told me to come back for another one in a month.

I know I probably should listen to the doctor, but i'm a huge pussy and scared of having my blood taken, and I honestly am feeling a bit better since last month.  The doc told me that it could also be a mental thing (anxiety), and i've been seeing a therapist, so it could be true.

"4 year old child vomiting for 5 daysApologies if i've formatted this wrong, or missed some information. I'm a bit stressed right now. I'll correct anything that needs it.

My daughter, 4F, has been vomiting for 5 days, since we were on a flight from Singapore to UK on Wednesday. It is slowly getting better. For the first 2 days she couldn't hold down anything, even water. Now she can hold down fluids if we're careful not to over do it (say a couple of sips of water or fruit smoothie every 10 minutes). She's had a couple of vomiting bugs before, but this is by far the longest lasting episode. 

Is 5 or more days normal? How long can something like this last? everything I read says that vomiting should stop within a couple of days. I'm worried that it's something more serious, or that a couple of days of basically nothing to eat or drink has done her some damage somehow.

We've seen a nurse, had a phone consultation with a doctor and seen one at after hours, and they all say that what we're doing is fine - keep pushing fluids and it will sort itself out. It doesn't seem like it will right now.

"Chronic cough for about 3monthsI'm 24, Male, about 85kgs. 176cm, Indian.

As the title says I've had a cough for about three months. It started out as dry cough but became productive now.

At first the coughing was extremely frequent and intense seemingly without any triggers. Making my whole body ache including sharp pain in my chest, belly, back, throat, shoulders, and it also gave me a headache (Sometimes a migraine, but rarely). Too much coughing made me weak and dizzy as well. Had a fever come and go every few days but it was always slight (99°F to 100°F)

The first 2 weeks or so it was dry cough but soon after it became productive. Sometimes wheezing. I even coughed up blood a bunch of times but not too much of it. Get a white, sometimes yellow, sometimes yellowish-red, sometimes yellowish-green phlegm. The coughing was intense. Frequent and INTENSE. Like there was a lot of force behind each cough which lead to a lot of pain. It felt like my lungs wanted to vomit. I couldn't go out of the house for a long time. I spent most of my time at home, leaving the house only to see the doctor or like once a week for half an hour at most. 

Now I cough fairly less but it's still fairly frequent. I cough a lot  less at home in my room and a lot more when I go outside.

I've noticed that certain strong smells trigger a HEAVY cough (it feels as if my chest wants to vomit), like smoke, perfumes, some air fresheners, dirty pee-poo smell, the smell of spice while cooking, etc.

Over the past 2 and a half months I've been on numerous medications which I'll list shortly.

Tests I've done: 
PFT: Normal

X-Ray of chest: Normal

CT-Scan of chest: Normal (though the report said 'no significant abnormalities so idk why it was worded that way but doc said normal)

IGE: Slightly high but not too high, but I don't remember the exact amount, will edit with the value later perhaps (about to sleep)

Creatinine: Normal
GFR: 127 whatever that means.
CBC: WBC were within range but on the higher side.
Vitamin D: Deficiency. (11.2 or 12.1 I don't remember exactly. Will edit update in the morning)

I've visited 3 doctors. 

The first was a general physician who prescribed Cefixime 200mg twice a day.

After seeing little to no change I went to see a Pulmonologist

Over the course of two and a half months I've been seeing the pulmonologist, these are the medications I've taken: 
Fexofenadine + Montelukast tablet once a day.

2 Cough syrups with one with just Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide 

and one with a combination of Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide,Chlorpheniramine Maleate, Ammonium Chloride and Guaifenesin.

A syrup that's an antacid/antiflatulence as I get acidity sometimes (Magaldrate (400 mg/5 ml) + Simethicone (20 mg/5 ml), 10ml thrice a day, half an hour before every meal.)

Corticosteroids: First Deflaxacort (6mg)(21 days tapered off)

 and then Predisolone(10mg) (21 days also tapered off but still felt withdrawal regardless)

Felt about 40%-50% better after my last dose of Predisolone.

Went to the 3rd doctor while still seeing my pulmonologist coz family friends recommend him. Felt like he wasn't listening to my when I described my condition and thought anxiety was causing my cough(though I told him that the cough didn't seem to worsen when I felt anxious or decrease in it's absense) and gave me:

Escitalopram 10mg at night time for 10 days.

This had no effect on my cough and actually worsened my anxiety (which didn't cause more cough either.) So I discontinued after 10 days (has been over a month since)

A week after my last dose of Predisolone, my coughing improved to about 60%-65% and I felt confident about going out again.

The coughing returned after I spent a few hours outside for some work where there were a lot of smells and dust. It was once again the lungs-wanting-to-vomit cough combined with normal productive cough with wheezing.

The lungs-wanting-to-vomit cough comes whenever there are strong smells around. It feels as though my lungs REALLY don't want those particles in them and will get them out even if it kills me lol.

Other symptoms I'm feeling:
Extreme Fatigue even after a little bit of walking of exercise
Sleepiness during the day, even mere hours after waking up.
Extreme Weakness in the muscles probably due to lack of activity
Acid-reflux that sometimes irritates my throat.
Depression because I've been doing nothing and been absolutely worthless wreck of a human who's only causing concern and worrying to those who love me. And I haven't been out of the house much. 

I went back to the Pulmonologist who has now given me Cefixime 200mg and Montelukast (once a day) along with the Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide syrup (thrice a day) and the Antacid/Antiflatulence syrup mentioned earlier and has advised to see if that makes some difference over 10 days. The doctor said he'd perform a Bronchoscopy if it didn't help.

It's been 8 days and I'm not coughing as much as home, as was the case after finishing Prednisolone and I've been able to suppress my cough when exposed to smells that aren't too strong but I still cough INTENSELY (occasional vomit-from-chest-cough + productive frequent coughing) after going outside and exposing myself to strong smells.

Also, sometimes I get a metallic taste in my mouth.

I have gall stones.

I have had recent issues with ovarian cysts rupturing fluid into my abdomen but this has resolved.

However I can now not sit with my back against a chair, have any duvet on my back at night or have anyone or anything touch me there as it feels awful. It doesn't hurt but maybe it's because I'm on strong painkillers anyway. It just feels awful! The only thing I can find on Google is bone spurs or spondylosis.

"General lack of motivation and focus/direction in life is making me feel highly irritable and depressed. Extremely poor concentration and short term memory.Hi all, I’m a 25y/o male. Mostly sober with the occasional alcoholic drink, which was minimal before but I’ve cut it to almost nothing because it’s interfering with my sleep and making me feel like garbage the next day. Very active and aside from knee pain which hasn’t allowed me to run in several months I have no physical health issues that I’m aware of. 

To cut to the point, I gave up nicotine (heavy vaping) more than three months ago. I felt incredibly angry and depressed for several days in a row and the nicotine just wasn’t making me feel better, so out of anger/spite/bitterness I said fuck it and quit cold turkey because if it wasn’t making me feel better, why continue? Haven’t had a puff since and really felt no urge to vape in the slightest a little over a week into quitting. 

Problem is that since I’ve quit my irritability, inability to focus, and shitty short term memory have been through the rough. As for my irritability it’s gotten to the point where my mom has mentioned that I’m not myself and have been rude and I myself am miserable due to how irritated I am about anything and everything. My focus is literally out the window, it was pretty poor while vaping but it has become unbearable since, the only way I am able to watch, focus on, and take in any sort of TV is while working out which I have become obsessive about because it’s the only thing that makes me feel normal for a slight slice of my day. When it comes to my short term memory, I find myself constantly backtracking my thoughts to remember what I was thinking just moments ago, only because I’ve already began thinking about something else. I’ve left my oven on once while at work because I forgot to turn it off and couldn’t remember if I turned it off several more times while at work, turns out I did those times. Several times within the last few months I’ve walked away with the sink still running after brushing my teeth and didn’t notice it until later. Quite often I will find myself several miles down the road while driving to work only to not remember any of the last 5 minutes because I’ve been consumed by my thoughts.

I am absolutely miserable, it’s affecting my work life as well as my home life. I’m absolutely consumed by negative thoughts. My relationships feel like a chore to maintain and I have no motivation or energy to do anything. I get up, sit around for a few hours, work out, go to work, come home, work out, and go to bed.

Along with the visual issues, I also experience tinnitus. This can be extremely irritating and keep me awake at night or unfocused at school. I had these problems even as a young kid. I had trouble explaining it to my parents and doctors, so nobody really knew how to help me. I went to eye doctors as a kid who came up with nothing, sending me off to a neurologist. After an MRI came up with nothing, he wrote off my condition as “some type of visual migraines???” and I basically just ignored my problems pretending i was fine, for YEARS. Lately, I’ve been discovering a lot of things online and wondering if anyone here might be familiar with these issues. I found out that I might have something called “visual snow” which basically causes there to be static in my vision. All. the. time.

I’ve been to an audiologist and asked my eye doctor about the first two problems. They identified no problems with my hearing or vision (besides my need for contacts).

"(26F) Nicked on thumb by stray cat?We just found a docile stray cat outside and brought her into our garage to wait and call animal control in the morning, but while shutting the garage door the noise startled her and she nicked me on the thumb. I couldn’t tell whether it was a scratch or a bite, but I’m leaning towards the latter. The wound is tiny, about 2mm, very shallow, and while it looks like there’s a tiny bit of blood in it there hasn’t been any active bleeding. I washed it almost immediately with soap and warm water and put alcohol on it; should I go to the clinic tomorrow? I’ve been told the risk of rabies from strays is low but I’ve also heard you can get all sorts of infections from cat bites, but at the same time if a costly medical bill is avoidable that’s preferable.

UPDATE: I went back to check on her and caught her both eating the food I left out and drinking a decent amount of the water I left, which is reassuring. I’m calling animal control when they open and hopefully the lady will have some insight on whether or not she’s got any symptoms. I’ve heard that if cats aren’t showing symptoms they can’t spread the disease? If anyone knows whether or not that’s true I’d like to hear your input.",AskDocs,t3_dkxxix

"Severe digestive issues, a side effect of PPIs?I’m a male in my 20s. I have had acid reflux for years and have been on different brands of PPIs. At first it was like a magic pill that allowed me to eat. Now however, it’s as if I cannot digest anything anymore. I’ve eliminated many foods but no matter what I do, everything I eat still bothers me. By bother I mean gives me lots of gas, bloating, tight feeling in stomach and feeling that the food wants to leave the other end.  I also think I have mild diarrhea as my bowels often are porridge like / watery and smell like sulfur. I always feel better after a bowel movement and my abdomen becomes noticeably less bloated.

I’ve had a gastroscopy and colonoscopy with biopsies but they’ve come back clear. I’ve also been tested for small bacterial overgrowth but it came back clear too. I’ve checked digestive enzymes too and they are fine. I have lactose intolerance but eat lactose free dairy products. 

The doctors have told me it’s IBS but that doesn’t really help me. I don’t think I can eliminate more foods as my diet is already limited and I’m struggling to find things to eat. I’m not sure what to do. I think it’s a complication of the PPI (pantoprazole) that I’m on. I’ve been on PPIs for years and it’s only gotten worse over the years. Also, they don’t treat the reflux as well as when I first started. I think my digestive issues are caused by this medication because when I forget to take my daily dose my stomach feels more at ease and I have less trouble digesting food. My stomach doesn’t feel so tight when I eat without taking the medication. The problem is that I have bad reflux and PPIs are the only thing that help. I’ve tried quitting them slowly over several weeks but it is just not possible to be without them. I’ve tried H2 blockers like zantac but they’re not as effective and I still have digestive issues while on them. 

So I think the medication I’m on is harming me and is severely affecting my life, but at the same time I cannot live without it. What can I do?",AskDocs,t3_dkxqe6

Height: 5'1

I get very very hot/cold easily out of nowhere. It feels like I am extremely cold but when I touch my body I'm actually hot. But someone feels my skin and I actually feel fine? I don't even have a fever.

I struggle to do things constantly. I will want to do things, I will desperately want to do them, but I just can't. It's like I'm trying to push a pull door. I have put off very very simple 5 minute tasks for weeks because I can't do them. I'm not lazy. I know I can do these things but I can't. I don't know why? I can't muster up any motivation to do things even if I want to do them. I do it for all kinds of things. I set timers for 15 minutes to do even basic things, else I don't do it. I never get around to shows I like even if I want to do them but I can't start. Sometimes I break the loop, but it is agonising sometimes. :(

I have diagnosed OCD and anxiety. I used to have extremely frequent breakdowns because I would get OCD thoughts worrying about other people wanting to hurt me. I know it's irrational, so it's not psychotic, but I feel very very scared around people sometimes. I get worried that people see me in a sexual way or have a crush on me, and it makes me feel sick. Sometimes I worry my family sees me like that. So I get randomly high-key and nervy around certain people until it passes.

"Currently concerned about wife passing outOriginal Post Sunday at 5pm: Hello. I am writing this for my wife (on her account) whose symptoms are worsening. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, as doctors have blew it off in the past and I'm worried about her. Also wondering if I should take her into the ER or just let things play out in the comfort of our home.

* Symptoms are currently present and have been worsening since the middle of the night (Friday/Saturday overnight)
* 25 year old female weighing 170 lbs, not very active lifestyle
* Symptoms: clammy, weakness, dizziness, extreme fatigue, on the edge of passing out with any sort of strain, current heart rate is marked at 43 and typically resting around 65. She looks extra white as she feels worse.
* She is not dehydrated, not malnourished, and has not been overexercising. No drugs, alcohol, or medication.
* Medical history: overall very healthy. However, these symptoms have been coming on more frequently (for a day at a time), then disappear. She's passed out twice that I'm aware of- Nov 2018 and Feb 2019. Both times an EKG was done and no rhythm issues were spotted. They just sent her home to lay low because apparently this is fairly common.

Update Sunday 745PM: Now at the ER seeking help. Decided to bring her in after a heart rate of 39

Update Sunday 1030pm: She's admitted overnight until a specialist can come in asap. They did an EKG(?) and gave her some medicine to get her heart rate up/ relieve symptoms but wasn't responding. She has passed out once shortly after arriving. I'm still trying to comprehend it all and am just doing a lot of waiting

Update Monday 6am: She's been sleeping it off which has been her main relief. I feel like a terrible person because over the last week she's had some dizziness and extreme fatigue, and she would just plop in bed and it would piss me off because it got old after the 3rd day..

Weight: 120lbs

Duration of complaint: 3-4 years
Location (Geographic and on body): Toes
Any existing relevant medical issues (if any): ADHD
Current medications (if any): Dexedrine, Birth Control

During the day my toes are tinted purple, just like a light purple mixed with skin tones, the purple tint is most visible on the knuckle of the toes.

But at night in bed, or when I shower, my toes turn red and swollen and tingly.

For the longest time I figured I was just pre dispositioned to having perpetually cold feet, I have had cold feet for as long as I can remember, but only in the last 3-4 years have they started to be purple normally and then red and swollen when hot. Also, I try to wear socks or keep them covered as often as possible but they’re still always cold, only warm up / get red and swollen in bed or in hot water.

I was okay with living with my cold feet for the longest time, but now over the last 5ish months my toes have started to blister on my toe knuckles? I don’t notice the blisters much during the day when my feet are cold, but when they’re in a warm red and swollen state, I can see the blisters much more and they’re sore to the touch.

"Help With ON/TN Related Vertigo and Seizures. Really Desperate. 40F**Background:** My spouse (40F) was diagnosed with Occipital Neuralgia over a decade ago, but the symptoms go back 20 years. They've also had symptoms of Trigeminal Neuralgia the entire time (including searing face pain and intense facial spasms), but we didn't know what that was and they were never given a formal diagnosis for it. The symptoms first began on the right side, but have slowly begun creeping up the left side.

Anesthetic, steroid and Botox blocks have all been effective at targeting the pain in the past. Drugs like Zomig barely ever did anything, the only drugs that ever seemed moderately effective were Topamax and beta blockers. The most effective treatment was a radio frequency ablation they had several years ago. Unfortunately we don't have real insurance and aren't in a position to afford any expensive medications or treatments right now

Currently they are self medicating with kratom (no more than 1tbs per day) and medical cannabis (10mg of edible full spectrum oil three times a day) to at least dull the pain and muscle spasms. It has at least allowed them to get out of bed most days. We've been trying to get them on disability/medicaid since I lost the job that was providing top tier insurance, but there have been a lot of roadblocks.

**The Problem:** Before the RFA treatment for their ON, they were having chronic vertigo related to their migraines which was getting progressively worse to the point they could no longer work. They could grit their teeth through the pain most days, but at a certain point they couldn't stay on their feet long enough to get to the bathroom without help. Unfortunately, that vertigo seems to be returning and getting worse by the month. It's almost as bad as before the RFA treatment.

They've also been having mild seizures, which are localized to the shoulder and neck on the right side. Usually they shake rapidly but sometimes they just seize up very painfully, with every muscle from their right shoulder up to the right side of their jaw holding at a maximum flex. They occur in a series of short bursts of about 5 seconds up to a minute over the course of an hour. My spouse is conscious during the shakes, but usually becomes uncomfortably euphoric. Only a few times have they fully passed out or gone limp after a seizure and only for a few seconds.

These seizures first showed up after we lost our insurance a couple years ago, which means we have no official diagnosis if they are related to the neuralgia. The first was about a 1.5 years after their last RAF and a bit less than a year after their last Botox treatment. I can't be certain if that's causal, but that's the timeline. The seizures used to hit once every month or two, but are now daily without the cannabis oil. The self-medicating with kratom and cannabis started **after** the seizures first began. Stopping kratom has had no impact on the seizures, but stopping the cannabis oil does seem to increase their frequency and severity.

One thing that seems to make the seizures much MUCH worse is taking a lot of non-drowsy Dramamine (meclizine) for the vertigo. It specifically causes their jaw and tongue to be much more active during the seizures, and made me worried they might bite their tongue. The seizures and vertigo also don't seem particularly connected to their menstrual cycle.

**Possibly Relevant:** We recently moved from CA to IL for financial reasons, and while the vertigo and seizures had been slowly getting steadily worse over the last year, they seem like they've gotten significantly worse in the four months since the move. My spouse had nearly two months without any cannabis as we dealt with the paperwork, and the oils here have fewer ""cannabidioids"" than the oil they got in CA. The barometer is also wildly different out here, and big barometric shifts have always been a bad trigger for their migraines/cluster headaches.

**The Ask:** I'm just looking for any advice on how to help them manage the vertigo and seizures until our situation changes. The only vertigo solutions I've seen anywhere are those exercises for inner ear crystals, and that's not what this is.

We can't afford the kind of gold tier ACA plan that would cover the diagnostics and treatments for all of this, but I make too much money to qualify for Medicaid until we can get them approved for disability (we've had to restart the process since moving). We spend about $60 to $100 per month on kratom and cannabis, and there's not a lot of room to work with in our budget beyond that. Even after tax credits, the ACA plan we'd need that covers things like Botox is almost $350/month.

We're really desperate, because the better my spouse is doing and the less care they need, the less frazzled I am and the more hours we can put into freelancing to afford proper insurance, diagnostics and treatments. We've been stuck in this spiral for three years now and I'm frankly at a loss for how to get out of it.

"Drastic sudden health issues after antibiotic use?24 Female, White, Southern US, 107 lbs. 5’5”, Duration of complaints: Since May 2019

In May of this year I developed UTI symptoms (urgency, burning while urinating) and assumed that’s all it was and went to an Urgent Care. Had blood in my urine so they prescribed me some antibiotics for a week. It didn’t help at all. Went to a gynecologist the following week and they diagnosed me with a kidney infection and PID (which is strange because I’ve always been negative for any STI’s and on my visit summary they just listed “acute cystitis” which I’m not sure if that’s a kidney infection or not) but the doctor that saw me after didn’t know why I didn’t get further testing for a kidney infection. Idk. 

So I was put on Doxycycline and Metronizadole. This didn’t seem to work either and I began having vaginal and constipation issues as well and the urinary symptoms got worse and continued. I developed a couple yeast infections (diagnosed) and began to stay constipated week after week, only regularly going like 1 or 2 days a week and then getting constipated again. So after those diagnosed yeast infections, I kept getting yeast infection symptoms but strangely started testing negative for anything. I also developed BV apparently but that was based off just an exam and not a culture, which I don’t understand why it was done like that. But I was given metronidazole again. 

In between this time, I also tried Monistat twice and felt like I had some kind of reaction from hell the second time I used it. I literally went to the emergency room from the pain and they said I could have had some kind of reaction to it. 

So all of this continues for months. Sometimes the urinary symptoms are worse, sometimes the vaginal symptoms (which also include just constant burning) and sometimes the digestive symptoms are worse. I developed awful hemorrhoids as well from the chronic constipation. Sex had also become near impossible and painful because of the constant burning in my vagina. Gyno suggested I might have vulvodynia. Never had issues with pain during sex until all of this started. One gyno also suggested I might have Interstitial Cystitis but when I went to a urologist they were unhelpful and didn’t seem to know much about it. I also had blood in my urine but came back negative for infection. The blood in my urine but no infection has happened for months.  Did find out I have very low vitamin D but not sure what that could affect. 

Fast forward a few weeks ago, I got super sick and couldn’t eat and had terrible stomach pains went to the ER and they said I had a couple of large fecal impactions and gave me an enema which was extremely painful and told me all these laxative cocktails and strong laxatives to take. My constipation has still continued and I’m not sure if the fecal impaction is still there are lot. I’ve gone from 125 to 107 during these few months because I get sick if I eat to much and honestly I’ve gotten scared to eat. I know that I’m underweight and it scares me but the constipation makes it near impossible. 

I currently can’t sleep because the urinary issues are so bad. It’s just this constant, miserable, unbearable urgency. I haven’t drank anything in hours and I still have the urge to go constantly. I’ve lost so much sleep.  

Right now I have an appt with a pelvic floor therapist. Idk what else to do. Anyone know why all of this could have happened all of a sudden and what could it be? Could it have been all the antibiotics? I was totally healthy up until a few months ago now I’m in near constant misery",AskDocs,t3_dkxawy

"Sore throat and pressure in left earHi.

21M, 175 cm, 75kg.

My problem: 3 weeks ago on saturday I got sick (sore throat and coughing). I went to the doctor on monday. I was told that my tonsils were red and swollen. I got some tablets which dissolve in water(don't know the name, took it 3 times a day), Dorithricin (3 times a day), and Novorin. I stayed home for a week, I took my medication until they ran out, except for the novorin, I only used it a few times because my nose wasn't that stuffy. I was told to go back if I feel worse. I felt somewhat okay, but next week I felt like my throat was getting sore, but only in the morning, and my nose was somewhat stuffy. I used that nosespray a few times, but since then I haven't used it, because it said not to use it for more than 3-5 days (even though I only used it occasionally). Also I started feeling some pressure in my left ear. I accidentally pushed the earwax inside while trying to clean it (I thought the pressure was caused by earwax), so I had to have it washed out to hear again. I thought that resolved my ear issue.

I was feeling okayish. Then I had to sprint for a short distance with heavy stuff to catch a bus, maybe that made things worse, and I cried a few times in the last few days because something bad happened to a loved one.  - perhaps these made things worse? These happened a few days ago.

So it's been a little bit over 2 weeks since I got initially sick. My throat is somewhat sore, it's a bit annoying, and I cough  a lot, my nose is somewhat stuffy, and there's some pressure in my left ear (but it doesn't hurt). 2 weeks ago I had a fever, I felt tired. Now I only have the symptons I have mentioned. No fever.

I do not drink, smoke or take any medication.

If possible, I'd rather not go to the doctor, because I'd have to wait too much, and I have things to do. Should I go to the doctor? Or at least should I take any medication?

I am only concerned this much, because usually these things go away in less than 2 weeks, but it's been more than two weeks. Could the things I mentioned cause it to get worse again? Also is the pressure in the ear also normal, should I do something about it? Should I start using the nosespray 3 times a day now for 3-5 days? (I only used it maybe 6 times in the past 2 weeks).

The tremors are all the time, mostly when I try to do my workouts or lift something around my work or home. The lightheadedness comes and goes. Headaches are rare now. 

I visited my doctor, who prescribed amoxicillin (thinking it could be a sinus issue) and some Sudafed. The amoxicillin ended up causing some major reactions to my tremors, to the point I couldn’t sleep at night. So I had to stop taking it. 

We did a CT scan on my head for tumors (normal CT head), a plethora of lab tests (for low magnesium, autoimmune, etc). Nothing. Magnesium came back low normal. Visited neurologist, who did a quick visual test and didn’t appear concerned that it could be MS, PD, or the such. Felt confident it was low magnesium. Then labs came back normal.

"Long lasting nerve damage from IVHi, I'm a 40 Male 5'6"" 255lbs with what I believe to be permanent nerve damage to my hand/wrist.  In August of 2018 I went in for my 5-year colonoscopy (my father died at 53 from colon cancer, so these are suggested fairly young for me).  Before the procedure, I was approached by two nurses, one went over all my information while the other placed the IV on my lower forearm, about an inch or two from my wrist. Upon insertion I felt immediate, shocking, burning pain from the point of insertion through my wrist and into my index, middle and ring fingers.  I've had numerous IVs and shots before and they never bothered me, just a quick stinging sensation that goes away, but the IV caused severe pain right away.  I grunted and huffed and puffed and told the nurse that it hurts.  I told her multiple times that it hurt, but she was rather dismissive and told me that it was fine.  So from that point on until I was wheeled into the room (5-10 minutes maybe) and put under I felt that same amount of intense pain.  

Post procedure, the pain was still there, but not as potent.  I shrugged it off for the first few days thinking it was bruising by the nerve or something.  But a week went by and even the slightest touch to my wrist would create a jolt and moving sensation along the path from where the IV was to my fingertips.  I called the place where my colonoscopy was performed, and they said it's something that would likely go away in a few more days or weeks.  A few months later while on a routine visit to my primary physician I explained to her that I still felt pain, and had numbness and tingling in my fingers (especially at the large knuckles).  She suggested it would eventually go away.  I saw her again about 8 months post colonoscopy, same issues with my hand, but again she thinks it will go away.  

So here I am now, it's been a year and 2 months since that IV was put in.  I still have constant tingling in my ring finger, some numbness in my index and middle fingers.  There's also a completely numb spot between the large knuckles of my index and middle finger (when I touch it it feels cold--and this is where the most intense pain was when the IV was first put in).  That spot on my lower forearm/wrist where the IV was inserted is still sensitive enough where a light brush or tap sends sensations down my fingers especially to that numb spot by my knuckles.  Sometimes when I use my hand (most in particular when I turn a door knob), I get pain all over again, and all of those fingers tingle for up to an hour.  I accidentally brushed knuckles up against my bedroom wall last night and again, tingling and the numb spot between the knuckles started to hurt.  

I play guitar and when I strum I agitate it just like when I turn door knobs--finger picking sometimes does this too.  This really pisses me off and gets me depressed at times.  Years ago I had job related CT problems (even had release surgery in left wrist), and when I couldn't play guitar, or when the playing was too painful I'd just spiral down into months long depression.  I want to find out what I can do about this, cause I'm planning on recording albums soon.  If I go to a neurologist, is this something treatable?  If it hasn't healed fully this long since I first got that IV, does it mean it's permanent.  Should I seek legal advice?",AskDocs,t3_dkrjp9

Ive has a slew of neurological problems, to the point where they are now working on sending me to a Cleveland Clinic.

I’m desperately looking for answers. Over the past several months I’ve developed quite a few neurological issues. It started with the right side of my body completely changing in how it felt. That ranged from patches of numbness, to lack of feeling in my muscles. This continued and has since turned into muscle weakness and cramping in both arms and hands, loss of muscle in forearms and legs, loss of hair, significant changes in vision in my right eye like color shifting and double vision, tinnitus in my right ear and I’m pretty sure my right eye has sunken in further with created 4 days of ridiculous vertigo and pressure in my ear and eye.

This has also changed my facial appearance significantly. I used to have a more square/oval face and now it’s all started to droop and my eyes are sunken in and my face is more round. I’ve looked into this and found what is called hatchet face and that seems to describe very well the significant changes in my face in just the last ten months.

From what I’ve read is this muscular dystrophy? Could ANYTHING else be causing all of these problems?

I’m so tired all of the time. Normal tasks like washing my hair cause my right arm and hand to cramp up. I’ve lost a considerable amount of strength and I’ve become I recognizable to myself in the mirror because of the changes to my face.


I’ve had multiple MRIs, CT scans of brain, a full nuclear bone scan, skin biopsy, and Nerve Conduction studies, and a crazy amount of blood tests all of which have revealed nothing. 

My doctors have measured my arms and legs to track the muscle loss, to show a progression of that.

The neuro suspected Parry Romberg but my Rheumatologist doesn’t believe it’s that given the amount of neurological symptoms I’m having and the fact that it’s become bilateral. The rheum now suspects a metabolic or mitochondrial disorder but from what I’ve read it wouldn’t cause the significant changes to my face.

I had also taken the max dose of dayquil earlier. Few hours later I noticed my heart racing and it has now been 2 days since I have had heart rate below 90. When I stand up it shoots to 130-150 in the shower it went as high as 173 taken on my phone.

Been to 2 ers explained to them what happened. They see the fluctuation when I sit stand and walk. Normal sinus rhythm I just dont know what's happening and I'm scared the ibuprofen may have done something to my heart or stomach

Blood work ekg hepatic Thyroid xray echo all good. I didn't mention gi bleed I did not have anything to eat when taking it. Just had a bowel movement unsure if this looks this and I'm unsure if its tarry or black enough to be a concern and also it's been 2 days would I be dead by now?

"Need advice on medication 

What I'm asking isn't for recommendations on medicine, it's more of a general; Is this a bad combination/Not the right meds; And should I try to see a psychiatrist and get my prescription changed?

So, important info first: I've gotten the diagnosis Aspergers officially, but haven't got an official one for depression and anxiety by a psychiatrist, which I also suffer from and has been recognized by my private doctor.

I would categorize my depression as mild, and I've been getting Mirtazapine/Combar 15mg 1 hour before bed for close to 3 years now. For my anxiety, which I would categorize as severe, I've gotten Propranolol, where my intake differs and is not regular, but I usually take 30-40 mg before school. I also take Hydroxyzine 50 mg, both morning and before bed.

Besides that, I also take Imodium sometimes in the morning.

So as I said, am I getting the wrong medication, which is prescribed by a normal doctor and not a psychiatrist, or does some of it not mix well?

I'm a 21M, 171 cms tall, 58 kg's ish, I don't smoke and only previous medical issues are mononucleosis

About a year ago I noticed a very small red dot on my lower lip. Since then it hasn't noticeably changed, except for maybe being more slightly raised and red. It could be my eyes playing tricks but it also looks like there's an area around the dot that's paler than the rest of the lip. It's painless and has never bled or scabbed.

"28F Cold/flu symptoms have lasted for 5 weeks nowHi all,

I apologize in advance for the long post, I’m just desperate for advice at this point on what seems to be the absolute worst illness I’ve had to date *knocks on wood*.

My fiancé and I traveled to the UK for vacation from 09/12 through 09/24 and I knew I had some type of flu beginning Thursday 09/19. It went downhill very quickly from there. Incredibly painful body aches, coughing, congestion, nausea, and some vomiting. I took as much cold medicine as I could to try and get me through the days leading up to our flight back home and saw my primary care provider the morning after returning. 

He said I had the flu, ear infections, and a sinus infection. I was prescribed antibiotics along with a Flonase and sent on my way. The symptoms kept progressing and I continued to see him every Tuesday for the next 3 weeks because of new or worsening symptoms including 2 occasions of conjunctivitis that I, I guess, managed to give myself because of the upper respiratory infection. This past week, while most of my symptoms improved, I was having very significant pain in my ears and throat. I was told there is no lingering infections but that I likely have fluid built up in my ears that’s causing the pain. I was eventually given a 5 day dose of Prednisone of 40mg which I just finished today and the ear and lymph node pain is back. Today, I also woke up with the worst round of vertigo I’ve ever had and started running a low fever this evening. I’ve also continued to have a cough that keeps me up at night as well.

I’ve been down with this (AND out of work) for 5 weeks now and I’m struggling with what to do. I know I have to go back to my PCP this week but I will gladly take any other suggestions or advice or just questions to ask at my next visit.

I’ve been on antibiotics, an inhaler, two types of codiene, eye drops, decongestants, OTC pain relievers, and Flonase with what feels to be little relief. 

It’s probably also important to mention that I do have a history of coming down with really bad colds once a year, but none that have ever lasted this long.

TL/DR: Cold/flu symptoms have lasted over 5 weeks despite multiple forms of treatment and rest. Desperate for solution.

On Wednesday, I noticed that I was developing a very scratchy throat but didn't think much of it. However, I could barely get through a chapter I was reading out loud to my students because my voice was degrading. I asked the school nurse on Thursday morning because I was feeling really rough, and she advised me to go to the Dr. thinking I might have strep due to a very red throat. The Dr. that evening said I was negative strep and flu, but diagnosed me with the flu anyway saying that it may just be too early. I have been taking Tamiflu twice a day since then. He also advised me to start taking Advil, 2-3 pills every 6 hours religiously to get me through the day. I have not developed any fever or body aches. I don't really feel any better, though. The coughing is hit or miss, and I have started to feel something rattle occasionally in my chest when I have a deep cough, my nose is almost constantly congested and runny, and I have started having sneezing fits. I feel very tired and hot. I'm considering taking time off of work on Tuesday (didn't set anything up for a sub on Friday) and going back to the Dr tomorrow evening.

I got an IUD in early June and had 3 periods after getting it, both much lighter but much more painful than before. I had no bleeding whatsoever in September, and figured I was done getting my period. However, on Friday(the 18th), I got cramps and later started bleeding. I had 0 cramps and 0 bleeding the next day. I took a pregnancy test this morning(Sunday the 20th), it came back negative, and I started getting killer cramps and heavy bleeding. I looked it up and deduced my IUD probably moved. It got so bad that I called a nurse hotline at a medical place nearby and I would have gone it, but my mom was at work and the nurse said they wouldn't see me by myself since I'm a minor. I tried checking for the strings at home, which I'll admit I haven't done since I got it(although my boyfriend has commented that he's felt them during sex), and I couldn't feel anything. I went to my boyfriend's house and he  checked for them, but said it felt like just the tips of them were sticking out of my cervix.

If I see a doctor, will they remove it and have me get a new one? Will they remove it and reinsert the same one? Will they reposition it?

"Asymmetrical lymph nodesMale, 22, 5'7, 130lbs, Michigan, Lymphatic system.

So, for my entire life, the lymph nodes on the left side of my body have always been bigger than the right side.

For example, on the left side of my neck, I can feel a few of them, very easily. On the right, most of the time I can't feel any at all. Maybe one or two of them.

On the back of my head near my spinal cord, same deal. I can feel them on both sides, but there seems to be more on the left side.

In my abdomen, I can't really feel any on the right of the groin area. But I've notice that on the left, just left of where my bladder would be, there is a huge lump that feels like a few lymph nodes.

I first noticed this when I was laying down, and it turns out I can only feel this when laying on my back.

So, left of my bladder, there seems to be several large lymph nodes, but on the right in the exact same location, I feel nothing. This leaves me wondering exactly what's going on.

I don't know if I've always had these large lymph nodes left of my bladder, because this is the first time I've felt them.

However, I do vividly remember that when I was a child there was this huge scare because my parents though I had a tumor, but after being examined, doctors said they were just normal lymph nodes. I don't know if these lymph nodes I'm feeling now are the same ones that gave my parents a scare back then, I can't remember.

But why on Earth would I be able to feel all the ones on the left, but not the right? This makes no sense to me, and makes me wonder if I have clammydia, or ghonnorea, or cancer.

The stuff in my groin I just recently noticed, but my lymph nodes have always seemed to be assymetrical and I have no idea why.

Should I be concerned about assymetrical lymph nodes, even though I've always had them?

Also, is this large cluster of nodes left of my bladder a cause for concern?

Edit: It seems inside this cluster, there is an especially large node. I can actually see it poking up from my skin if I suck in my stomach.

"Large itchy lumps on arms25F height 5’3” - weight 160lbs. I currently do not take any medications. Pictures linked. 

I have 2 baseballs size lumps on my arms. They are extremely itchy, red and warm to the touch. The center is firm to the touch when pressed on. It looks like there’s a bite mark in the center of the lump and sometimes yellow dried crust will be around it. One is so big, it’s a little painful to the touch. I’ve had these multiple times before but I have no idea what they can be. The bumps last for about a week. I go to sleep, and whenever I wake up, that’s when the large bumps appear.  I’ve done research and it’s not bed bugs, mosquito bites, fleas, or chiggers. I’m a little concerned because of the size of the lump. What can this be?

"(M22) Second Hand Smoke riskAge: 22 Sex: Male Weight: 145 Height 5 10'

So I have gotten a big break in my professional life, however the person I will be working with smokes. I have seen them in the garage with the garage door shut, smoking. I imagine this is backing up into the house through the nonperfectly sealed door not to mention when opening and closing of it to come in and out of the home. I am extremely compelled to continue working with this person, and even occasionally sleeping at the home as this career would net me more than double what I have ever made in the past.

My question is what would the effect of this be on my body in a timespan of 6-9 months?

Would staying in the basement be any help or would there be an equal amount of pollution due to the air conditioning systems?

I could potentially make use of some things to help:

Weather stripping the door between home and garage and installing exhaust system system to get negative pressure in the garage, However worst case scenario: Weather stripping being the only preventative measure I'm taking, what damage am I going to do?

Tl;dr: I can make more money than I ever have in my life, problem is I would have to live in a home connected to a garage potentially filled with smoke and a closed garage door keeping the smoke in for the winter, with only a (well) sealed door to the home keeping it out. Looking to know the risk of this on my body if I stay in the basement of the home so i can make an educated decision while considering if its worth it.

Edit: Yes I realize I can ask them to help but I am trying to consider worst case

"Why won’t my doctor remove my tonsils?24f, 5’8”, 160lbs, SE US. Primary complaint: chronic sore throat (2+ months) and intermittent sinus infections

Diagnosed conditions: ankylosing spondylitis, fibromyalgia, POTS, migraines, history of TIAs, chronic UTIs, some sort of unnamed autoimmune rash thing as a result of an allergic reaction to Remicade

Medications: atenolol, Cosentyx, cyclobenzaprine, dupixent, methenamine hippirate, otezla, vitamin D3, cranberry tablets 

As a kid, I had a real issue with strep throat and it was highly recommended to my parents that I have my tonsils removed, but they couldn’t afford it (either no insurance, or not good insurance). By the time they could afford it, it had been several years since I’d had problems. Diagnosed with AS at 16 and put on immunosuppressives. Now, after 8 years of immunotherapy, I have chronic sore throats. They wax and wane a little—really bad for a week or so, my tonsils will be red, swollen, and full of tonsil stones, and then for a week or two it will still be more sore than normal, but tonsillar inflammation and visible tonsil stones recede. Constantly back and forth, along with sinus drainage/pressure. 

Last year, I had tonsillitis twice and I requested to have my tonsils removed—both the history, the fact they are not necessary, and the frequency with which I’m sick as a result of the immunosuppressive drugs—and he said no. I recently visited him again, took the records from several urgent care visits (my PCP is difficult to schedule with for acute illness), and again he declined with no explanation. Is there a legitimate to not have my tonsils removed? I realize the tonsils have a role in the immune system, but if they are constantly the source of inflammation, wouldn’t removing them reduce inflammation? Is there something else I can do to treat a sore throat that’s lasted more than two months besides “waiting it out,” as I’ve been told? I get that’s the proper response for a viral infection...but there has to be SOMETHING. OTC cold/sinus meds aren’t helping and I can’t keep on like this.",AskDocs,t3_dkuwrp
"Sudden Bilateral Supraclavicular SwellingAge: 41 / Sex: F/ Height: 166cm / Weight: 75kg/165lb

Five days ago, I noticed golf ball-ish sized bilateral swellings in my supraclavicular region.  In the typically-concave triangular space above my clavicle, I now had mounds. I immediately suspected lymph nodes, but what I had seemed more pronounced and edematous. Soft, fluid-filled to the touch, not hard, not tender, red or painful. Dr Google told me the more sinister state would be if it \*were\* nodal and specifically unilateral. Instead, both sides swelled evenly. Over three days, they have reduced by 75%. I do currently have cold symptoms (sneezing, minor cough, red, ulcerated throat, fatigue and watery eyes) - I'd usually put nodal swelling down to infection but, from what I know, that would be restricted to cervical nodes, not clavicular.

Background med history: Nothing to report besides menorrhagia and secondary low ferritin. No other known medical conditions, no regular medication. Of note: I started prescription iron tablets two days prior (stopped after noticed swelling, just in case of reaction). Visited my PCP today who, although experienced, said he'd never seen anything of the sort, specifically bilaterally. He was convinced the swellings are not nodal, also did a thorough physical examination - no other raised nodes to feel, no organomegaly felt elsewhere. He said they \*feel\* cutaneous but fat pads wouldn't rise overnight then reduce within days.

After the second instance, I went to the doctor, had chest x ray done, everything came back looking great.

The doctor told me that it’s probably due to some sort of inflammation in my throat, but said she wasn’t sure— just that she thought it would probably go away.

Basically, this morning I woke up with generalized abdominal pain, which is normal for me. I took my morning meds, then 30 minutes later ate a small peanut butter sandwich. Usually, I don't eat in the morning, so that might be relevant. Abdominal pain got worse after eating, which is also expected for me.

5 days ago I was hit very hard with a steel pipe in my upper shin.  It broke the skin and immediately swelled to the size of a grapefruit.  The following day the swelling was down considerably and I was able to go to work (I work on my feet as a bartender.) By that night it started hurting a bunch, so the next day I bought an ice pack and starting icing it every 4 hours or so and treating the pain with acetaminophen and the wounded area with neosporin. 

The problem I'm having is mostly with swelling.  I've been sleeping with the leg slightly elevated on a couple pillows and every morning the swelling goes down considerably.  If I try elevating it while awake, laying on the couch with feet up on the arm, it becomes very sensitive and painful when I get up and try to put any weight on the leg. My whole leg is swelling, as well as my foot, even though the injury was to my upper shin.  I do have edema from hypertension and take 80mg furosemide daily to treat it, but even with that and peeing plenty, I can't get the swelling down.  The swelling seems to be getting worse over time, and now on day 5 my foot is really uncomfortable even just sitting down. Walking is very difficult and it feels like I'm limping mostly due to the swelling, not the pain.

Should I be worried or is this a natural part of healing from leg trauma?

I have a bump on the top of my foot. It's been there since March 2019 and fluctuates in size and symptoms. Sometimes it's asymptomatic and other times it hurts pretty bad. I figure skate and I believe it came about from getting new skates.

Age: 26 
Sex: female 
Height: 5’0”
Weight: ~140lbs 
Race: Caucasian 
Location: New York City 


For the past two ish years I’ve been occasionally experiencing what I thought was “trapped gas” - bloating, lower stomach pain, uncomfortable, etc but it always went away in a few hours and was infrequent. 

In the past ~6 months this has become an extremely common pain for me. Basically whenever I eat until I feel “full” I will experience this. The pain gets so bad it disabilitating. I feel pain in my lower stomachs but also between my shoulder blades on my back and it radiates. Laying down is the worst. I’ve had nights where exhaustion has taken over and I’ve slept upright. I’ve tried everything - all the otc medication, yoga positions, etc. I’m also not convinced it’s trapped gas anymore as relief doesn’t seem to be because of releasing gas, it just subdues eventually. 
It most often occurs at night but does happen occasionally during the day. 
When I’m experiencing this pain I’m also so extremely bloated that wearing anything slightly restrictive adds to the pain a lot. My belly just feels hard and bloated to touch and I can’t “suck in”. 

I do suffer from anxiety and depression and take 10mg of citalopram, which has led to a ~15lb weight gain. I have always had trouble sleeping.  I had a blood test done in July and I know my doctor included a thyroid test but I’ve read here that not all thyroid tests are ordered the same? 

I don’t know where to begin in terms of cutting certain foods out etc as nothing specific jumps out to me as problematic - and I eat fairly healthily.

38 yo male. 6/2 185lbs

The last 5 yrs I have been un able to manage my symptoms at all mostly. Same symptoms just greater in intensity.  

Pmx

2018:  1. Pectus Excavatum( recently diagnosed believe it or not). 2. Jaw infection(L side)due to infected tooth. Both wisdom teeth(top/bottom) were removed on L side. Balance and bite feel off but unsure becasue apparently my bite was so off that my top and bottom teeth(L side) are more than 50% more worn down than the teeth on my R side. Jaw surgery was my best option apparently. 3. TMJ(TMD)


2012: Back injury. L5/L6. Slight bulge to each disc. No major damage noted.Sciatic pain def became more
Noticable. 


2001: R side pain of hip/back/clavicle/neck(burning sensation) almost like the pain runs along since a nerve. This sensation began after working at a theme park(summer 2001) carrying heavy lemonade drinks on my R side and sometimes above my head always having the load on my R side. 


Ever since the burning sensation started all the way back in 2001 i havent felt right. Just off center if i could explain it in a few words. The most notable difference is the invisible force that felt like it was tugging me neck back and to the R toward my R shoulder. This feeling has never left. Its been very noticeable at times and slightly noticeable. Its never left though. lived two decades got married children, divorced. Recovering addict(2105)lost good jobs and most of my friends. 


Fast forward to 2018. Began noticing id wake up and feel like my entire R side had been cranked to the side of the pull of my neck. Like my entire body was being pulled and not just my neck. I noticed i would be standing and be in this pulled position and would have to mimic the posture on the L side of my body to bring me back to neutral.  I would have episodes of shortness of breath because my posture would be so off. Only the R side. Never the left. 


Its almost an everyday/every hour battle with me now. I spend alot of my time concentrateming on not allowing the pull to my R side to win. Because if i give in thats when the pain and breathing issues exacerbate. The mental strain of this being my central concern is slowly killing me. 


Its a situation that since 2001 i havent been able to explain/understand/have others understand.


My research has gone down many rabbit hole. This may be another rabbit hole but i feel i may have

This may be why my neck has always felt pulled to my R. It may be why that side feels like its always opposing the other. My neck pulled to the R side while my jaw and face go left.

"Unanswered chronic fatigue advice27 male, white, 5ft9, 80kg

I have experienced some level of tiredness since my teens. I have had all blood tests possible taken with nothing out of place.

Symptoms: a general lethargy, which is accentuated when attempting extreme action eg sprinting - even when very fit, I will be unable to fully exert myself most of the time and will often feel debilitatingly tired when attempting to play rugby. At its worst, during the game I will feel nauseous and will crave sleep and feel as if I can barely hold myself up, I will not be able to concentrate or think properly either - I have had to take myself off the pitch before.  However, what is strange is that by the end of the game, sometimes my body may have ‘woken up’ and I will suddenly feel the energy that my prior fitness training should render me with. I will almost always feel fitter and more lively by the end of a game.  After the match I will feel physically and emotionally drained, often depressed. 

I realise this may come across as a common/vague chronic fatigue issue, however I’m intrigued by the sudden change which can happen in my physiology mid game, which is something I have not come across before or find anything about online.  Any advice around this would be greatly appreciated.

For the last year, whenever I listen to music my eyesight gets blurry. I get disoriented in physical space, and my hands stop working. 

-this happens in “episodes” every day, usually towards the end of day. Motorcycles, sirens, dryers, etc also seem to do it.
-vision: it’s not exactly blurry. If I stare at a word it has definition and I can read it. It’s more like a bright white halo around the outline of objects and words. It’s sort of like the visual feeling you get when you have low blood sugar and everything gets bright, but I don’t feel lightheaded per se.
-hands: i can feel them, I can move them. They just suck. I call them claw hands when it happens. I drop stuff, get extremely clumsy, have trouble w typing, buttons, etc. When I have an “episode” they just feel out of calibration for accuracy to work w/my body.
-physical space disequilibrium: it’s like I have tunnel vision kind of and the world closes in w/ very little periphery. The physical sensation of being really drunk and wobbly, but I’m sober (stopped drinking when symptoms starting affecting me). It doesn’t feel like I’m spinning or the world is spinning. It’s not really dizzy. If someone throws a baseball at your head and you ducked, that’s how I feel w/ everything around me w/ an episode. It’s like the circus scene w/ ether in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.

-symptoms don’t always happen all at the same time and can be in varying intensity. It’s usually abrupt. It doesn’t always happen when I stand up, but I think almost always happens after I move or stand up. The. Takes a while to recover (sometimes next day).
-Fairly acute onset when it first started.
-I’ve had fevers roughly every 45 days since it started summer 2018 (I was on the east coast - in mid coast Maine). I went through 2 months of four antibiotics in June 2019. That wiped out the fevers, but not other symptoms.
-heart randomly starts pounding in upper stomach, cspine, and/or chest. Pulse will go up to 115 sometimes; sometimes it’s normal. (this is not a complaint; just an observation).
-tinnitus, esp when lying down, every day. It can get very loud if in the right position. I can live w/ this though and ignore it. ENT said it’s not from conductive hearing loss. I also have irregular hearing loss in my L ear. ENT says also not from sound exposure damage.

"Possible cause of extreme hunger?Hello! I'm a 5'4, 120 pound, 24 year old Asian (Korean American) female. In the last three years, I've been experiencing pretty severe hunger, despite eating a lot. The first few months this happened, I would eat roughly 3 - 5000 calories a day and gained around 25 pounds, but was constantly ravenously hungry. I would eat several pounds of chicken, vegetables, and like 2000 calories of oatmeal in a day and still feel like I was about to pass out from how hungry I was. I started powerlifting in an attempt to lose some of the weight, which I did, but I was still extremely hungry, despite eating around 2500 - 3000 calories a day. A few internet searches without consulting a doctor (probably a bad idea lol), and I read about how fasting, intermittent fasting, and/or keto could help people who were experiencing severe hunger all the time. I tried it, and it just made the hunger so much worse that after a couple months trying this, I started binging, seemingly uncontrollably. 

I've largely gotten the binging in control with some help from Vyvanse (which I got a prescription for), but the extreme hunger is still there. About 6 months ago, I stopped taking birth control, and haven't gotten a period since then either. I'm not underweight, and I don't do cardio. I train for about 1.5 hours a day, 6 days a week, but it's pretty much all heavy lifting, and I'm otherwise fairly sedentary. My diet mostly consists of lean protein, vegetables, fruit, Greek yogurt, and oatmeal, with eating out on weekends. I average between 2 - 3000 calories/day, but I'm still dealing with feeling ravenously hungry all the time, even after finishing a large meal. 

I'll be getting some hormones tested in two weeks (I think thyroid, fsh/LH, prolactin, and estrogen), when I see a reproductive endocrinologist for the amenorrhea, but in the meantime, does anyone have any suggestions on things I can do to curb the hunger, or know a reason why I can't seem to stop feeling hungry all the time?

It's not as bad as it was back then, but it's still noticeably painful when I lay down or have non-straight posture. My hypothesis is that accutane is stored in my tissues and has elevated my regular vitamin a concentration, which is why the back pain remains.

I started getting joint pain in my hips and shoulders about a year, year and half ago that was made worse by inactivity. Since then, it's gotten progressively worse and I have constant pain in my shoulders, hips, knees, ankles, and sometimes my hands no matter how active/inactive I am. The pain is now keeping me up at night and sometimes wakes me up. 

I've also all but completely lost my appetite and feel full after a few bites of food. I've lost about 10 pounds since July this year and have lost about 15 pounds since this all started. My stomach seems to be very sensitive to anything and I often get gas/nausea, and pain. 

When I wake up, my limbs are numb and tingling like I've slept on them but it doesn't seem to be dependent on any position. If I sit in any position for even a few minutes whatever is being pressed on will go numb. I don't know if this is just from the weight loss and having less padding?

"Plantar fascia recoveryOk so about 6 weeks ago I tore my plantar fascia. I'm 6'2 and 17 stone and was playing football and out of nothing just ""pop"", at first I thought something hard like a hockey ball had banged into the bottom of my foot but nope, just my ligament!

I don't usually trust the internet for injuries as virtually everything seems to be open to interpretation, but for this it seemed pretty clear cut, injury out of nowhere (I'd had no pain or anything beforehand), I'm heavy, very active (on top of sports I have a physical job which keeps me on my feet all day, average around 15-20k steps a day just at work according to me Samsung watch), and high arches. I had a bruise on the bottom of my foot near the heel and it was very painful to walk on. Looking online there didn't seem to be an alternative for these symptoms to ""plantar fascia tear""

So I didn't bother going to the doctor's, all advice seemed to be rest and it should be fine in 6-12 weeks. Unfortunately I can't avoid walking due to my job, it's the busy time and absolutely no chance of a couple of weeks off unless I plan on going out of business! So I ordered an insole to protect the arch, and got one of the other guys to do the majority of my walking at work (cut my steps down to 8-12k per day, which is about the best I could do)

Now it's been about 6 weeks, I'm walking around fine but every now and then can still feel my foot, it doesn't hurt, just doesn't feel quite right, so I'm assuming it's not ready for sport again just yet. 

My question is how will I know when it is ready, and how can I avoid injuring it again straight away? I read that you can start jogging a few weeks before returning to sport, but given that I did not manage the ""2 weeks non weight bearing"" that virtually every website suggests, I'm not sure if that puts me ahead or behind schedule. I'm getting itchy feet without sport to play and, although I'm happy to wait until the full 12 weeks has passed, I really don't want to have it pop again straight away, so any advice on how to help it heal from this point on would be welcome!",AskDocs,t3_dkqtya

"Swollen rash like bump on arm, appeared after getting caught in some sort of string from a web. How can I get it treated?Backstory to how it appeared:

19M, I was walking to work in the morning and the same arm (IIRC the same area) got caught by a single string left behind by something. Inquickly tried to brush it off and carried on with my day as usual.

By the evening the same day, I brushed my arm without much thought and felt a ""sudden"" bumo appear. It was about 1 cm or so in diameter and felt a bit hard like a rash. It became red over time and I did see a very slight tinge of either white or light grey at the base of one of my hair follicles (I have a hairy arm). There was no pus or any discharge at all. No pain either unless I touch it. Even then it's a dull pain, nothing sharp or long lasting.

I immediately cleaned the area up and left it alone.

Two days later, the same hair I mentioned above grew freakishly long super quick and it's now 4cm long, as oppised to the other hairs on my arm, which are roughly less than a centimeter. The hair is also slightly grey in some areas than the other

I did notice however that the swelling has gone away a bit and the area has been shrinking back to normal, although it is still a bit red (not too noticeable)

I have not had other complications except for a bug bite on my belly the same day, except it was smaller and not swollen, just a little red. Probably a coincidence.",AskDocs,t3_dktizl

"Contradicting information on uterus business is making me think I’m going senile.I guess this is a rant in hopes of being educated. Yeah I’m aware that they’re caused by different factors in a woman’s body. I know that pregnant women can bleed. I know there’s no real medical purpose for a withdrawal bleed. I know that “anything is possible” but let’s be real here.. what is the likelihood?  

Shouldn’t their purpose be the same message? A woman who is pregnant would not get her period, she would have an implantation bleed which is noticeably different. I mean bleeding as in chunks of a lining that is used to hold a baby being bled out. You can’t tell me that it’s normal to bleed out that excessive and still be pregnant. 

At least for me, my withdrawal bleed is enough to fill pads/tampons. Which usually gives me relief that I’m not pregnant. But these people on Reddit and the Internet make it all sound like it’s a common thing to still get a heavy withdrawal bleed AND be pregnant. I’ve even tested for pregnancy this month and negative tests haven’t given me relief because everyone here says “well there’s a chance of a false negative...” 

I mean.. I even read of a woman getting false negatives until she was at ten weeks of being pregnant and everyone said “oh yeah same” as if that’s normal? Wouldn’t the FDA ban pregnancy tests that are notorious for giving inaccurate results for so long?

So why would someone tell me I could bleed that much out and still be pregnant while on the combo pill? This mix of information is what’s giving me anxiety about being pregnant (missed 2 pills in the month before, still took a Plan B).

For about 6 months I've been having pain in my prostate and testicles. At first, it was very occasional, and if I gave myself a gentle prostate massage it'd go away. For the last month or so, however, it's increased drastically. Typically the testicle pain is more due to the area being hyper-sensitive (I'm assuming from epididymitis). The pain gets worse if I need to poop, urinate, or have an erection, though it also increases when I exercise. If I give myself a prostate massage the pain goes away for a decent amount of time, typically around 1-2 days, but will flare up under the erection etc. conditions.

"Celiac VS gluten sensitivity.24F. NHL white, 5’4 180lbs. Current medications; multivitamin, vitamin D, birth control, Wellbutrin 300mg XL. Location: USA. 

Hi everyone! 

I’m a 24 year old female. I’ve been having GI problems for a while. In May, I went to my doctor and they said it was anxiety/stress related IBS which I didn’t disagree with. I was put on a few different medications, they helped to an extent. I was taking antispasmodic drugs every morning since May in hopes of not shitting myself on my way to work. My stools were fatty (if I didn’t have diarrhea that day), pale in color, sometimes full of mucus, sorry for the TMI. 

My grandfather has a wheat allergy AND celiac. 

The end of September/beginning of October symptoms really ramped up and I had some new ones as well. I had headaches just about daily, this brain fog where I’d forget what I was doing in the middle of doing it, not sleeping well at night, no real appetite, constantly in the bathroom, horrible stomach pains, joint pains that I couldn’t explain, and I was sleeping 10 hours a night and still exhausted. 

The second week of October I talked to my doctor and told him everything (this was on a Friday). At this point, I wanted to die. He instructed me to stop eating all wheat/gluten products immediately and I needed to do full blood work on Monday, including a celiac test. The next day, I woke up with a rash on my face. I used MDLIVE and was given a low dose of medrol. I was doing okay. Monday, I began breaking out into rashes all over at work. I left and went right to urgent care, I was having an allergic reaction to something. They gave me high doses of Benadryl and 80MG of prednisone for a week. I did my blood work as planned this day. 

I followed up with my doctor last week to go over everything. I don’t have celiac according to the blood tests. All other blood work/counts in the normal ranges. As far as the gluten diet...I haven’t had a single GI problem since, I’m not breaking into rashes, I’m sleeping *better* and not constantly tired, no more headaches, no more joint pain. The rest of the blood tests show I’m deficient in a few different vitamins - including vitamin D. I was put on 1000mg of vitamin D per day along with a multivitamin. Obviously continuing on the GF diet. 

I haven’t needed a single antispasmodic drug, my stools are completely normal in color and in form for once in I don’t know how long. BMs are on a normal schedule - no more urgency no longer in the bathroom countless times per day. I feel really really good. 

Right now, I’m just diagnosed as gluten sensitive. But my doctors radar was a little high because of the vitamin deficiencies as well, typically only seen with CD and not sensitivity. I was referred to an allergist to be tested for every food allergy under the sun which I’m getting on Tuesday. My doctor is also ordering more blood tests to look for hoshimoto disease and fibromyalgia - apparently they run hand in hand with gluten sensitivity and CD. 

I wasn’t referred to GI. CD test negative, and no antibodies. But my doctor wants to repeat all tests in about 6 months. He said the sensitivity is enough to cause minor damage to the body but not nearly as much as CD would. Also instructed to not even think about touching gluten and no cheating - a pretzel at this point would take me out for a week. 

Is it typical for someone who is just “gluten sensitive” to be put through the ringer of tests just as someone with CD? Also, is it likely with just a sensitivity that I could have the vitamin deficiencies? A wild scenario, is the possible to have CD and not have produced antibodies in the earlier stages? Could the steroids have messed with test results?

I have no desire to see GI about this or do an endoscopy. I suppose regardless it’s the same outcome for me - I can’t have gluten in any capacity. Just kind of wondering for my own peace of mind/benefit.",AskDocs,t3_dkqmj0

I drove myself to an urgent care where they thought I was dehydrated and heavily suggested I go to an ER where I can get IVs and blood/urine tests. That's what I did.  
They gave me fluids and an anti nausea. They pushed on my abdominal area and there was no pain. They asked for other symptoms, to which I responded there were absolutely none. No headaches, sore throats, diarrhea, etc. Blood work showed ketones and a low CO2 level. They said this is from not eating and hyperventilating while vomiting.  
They also said they were straight up making a guess that I have a viral stomach infection that needs to clear on its own. They sent me on my way with three days of anti nausea medication and hoped that my immune system will work better when I have food and water kept down.

The chest discomfort and pounding sensation is quite constant and can radiate to my back, into my arms, and is generally made worse when standing/walking.

I have been to see two separate cardiologists and have had multiple Holter monitors (2-3 and 14 days) with no significant abnormalities other than some sinus tachycardia, had an echo study done in February and have had two ECG stress test completed, both of which I had to stop around the 9-10 minute mark because of worsening symptoms, but there were no noted ECG changes other than some tachycardia again. BP is normal. One of the cardiologists put me on a low dose beta-blocker (bisopropol fumurate) to try and reduce some of the rapid heart beating. This has helped somewhat, but the strong pounding, tightness and pressure still persist and are becoming increasingly debilitating. Have had my thyroid function checked this was normal. No other abnormalities in my blood work. Pulmonary function test did reveal some mild asthma but otherwise okay. I even went to see a psychiatrist because one clinician thought it could be anxiety related, but the psych was quite adamant that she did not believe this was the case.

The symptoms are only getting worse from month to month, and none of my physicians seem to have an idea what to pursue next. Any suggestions or thought on possible underlying conditions or next steps that I could take to try and understand what is going on? ANY help or thoughts would be GREATLY appreciated.",AskDocs,t3_dkt29z
"Question on ECG from apple watchHello!

So i took an ECG and i was wondering what this little notch was at the end of QRS. I hear its a J wave. Is this early repolarization? Reading online i was really scared as it may lead to sudden cardiac arrest? Is this worth worrying about or is it a normal thing? Could someone let me know how this ECG looks?

"Question about chlamydiaFemale, 26, USA, no past medical issues, no smoking or drug use, taking birth control pills, white, 110 lbs, 5’1” 
Main complaint: I recently had a new sexual partner. He had STD testing done for everything at a planned parenthood. He was asymptomatic but received 1 g of azythromicin empirically at time of testing and told to abstain from sex for 7 days and his results would be back in 1 week. I have never had an STD in my life so I am very anxious about all of this. I stupidly had sex with him (without a condom) the night before it would have been the 7th day of treatment (we did this around 7pm Thursday night oct 17 he received the Zithromax oct 11 at 8 am). The next day after we had sex (which is the 1 week mark that they said his results would be back) he calls me that his results came back positive for chlamydia.  I immediately went to an urgent care to get tested and treated the same day. I was also given 1 g of Zithromax. 
Basically, I know that I’ll be fine since I got the dose of Zithromax. But what are the chances that I even contracted it because we had sex about 12 hours before it would have been the official 7th day of abstaining from sex, as the PA he saw told him to? As I mentioned before I have never had an STI and I have really been mad at myself for doing this, and definitely learned my lesson from not being more careful. I just want to know if there is a significant  difference in if we had actually waited till Friday instead of Thursday night.",AskDocs,t3_dksp05

I started vaping thc (pens) around March of this year, about once a week maybe less, over the summer it probably averaged to around 2-3 times a week. After these cases started coming out we all quit and the last time I vaped was September 6th. A few weeks ago I had a bit of a cold but it wasn’t terrible so I decided to smoke that night (flower not vape) next morning I woke up with a nasty cough and I got a bit sicker for like 4 days (I only really had a fever one day),however my cough lasted a while but not as bad as it was. There were also some days since my sickness that I felt I had some shortness of breath, last incident being last Tuesday, but It could’ve just been all in my head. Currently I feel fine I don’t really have much of a cough anymore but I just noticed today a soreness on the left side of my chest near the middle indent and towards the bottom of my chest. It doesn’t bother me and I don’t feel it unless I touch it. I also should probably mention I have asthma, but I’ve never had an asthma attack so it’s not terrible I guess.

"spotting when pregnant- really need answers pleaseWhite female, 31, currently pregnant, 163cm, 63 kilos, non smoker.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently 11 weeks pregnant and experienced spotting on and off until week 7- had 2 scans, the last one being a month ago showing a strong heartbeat and perfect measurements. At the time the hospital said that the spotting was nothing to worry about, my midwife on the other hand was very panicky about it and encouraged me to get a scan every time I spot.  The spotting has stopped for 4 weeks now, but this morning when I woke up after my first lie in in ages there was a tiny bit of pink on the toilet paper- and then nothing the rest of the day, no pain, nothing. The spotting is always, always first thing when I wake up - and then it disappears. One day only it came after a bowel movement. I'm on pelvic rest so not having any sex just in case. 

The hospital told me to only worry and come back if I was filling a pad and bleeding heavily, but they could not find any reason why I was spotting. They said perhaps it could be linked to my cervical ectropion. I am just very interested to see if any of you could give me some more info on this- if it was an hematoma, I assume it would have been picked up on the scans? As it is always when I get up, surely it has something to do with the lying down position?  I'm trying to sleep on my side to avoid sleeping on my belly and applying any pressure on my cervix, but maybe it's silly?

Finally- shall I worry about a possible miscarriage still now that I'm finally reaching 12 weeks and heartbeat was strong? Some doctors told me that the spotting did not increase my miscarriages risk, others said it did.

Height 6'0

Weight 155lbs

Medications: Sildenafil

Do not smoke or take drugs

Only medical issue

3 years pelvic region 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Ive been having this problems for over 3 years now. It has gotten steadily worse.

My symptoms are:

Erectile dysfunction. I cannot achieve erection unless taking over 100mg sildenafil.

Pain with ejaculation. On occasion I have ejaculated blood in semen.

Penis is painful to touch and is ""smaller"" than it used to be when flaccid. (I know people are hypochondriac about this, but this is the truth. It feels 'tight' and uncomfortable. than i remember in the years before i developed these issues)

Testicles swell up and feel hard sometimes, this is when most discomfort occurs. Usually helped by hot bath and they return to normal size.

Constant ache and feeling of fullness below base of penis that is temporary relieved with ejaculation. If i go more than a day without ejaculating, it becomes unbearably painful.

Poor urinary flow.

Taking sildenafil(viagra) temporary relieves these symptoms. Everything feels like normal until the effects wear off. Unfortunately taking 100mg sildenafil gives me headaches and blurs vision and thus is not a proper solution for day-to-day. Only take it for sex. After taking sildenafil my testicles shrink to their normal size and no longer feel uncomfortably swollen.  This return to normality lasts around half a day

==========================

Reduced urinary flow and erectile dysfunction started slightly over 3 years ago. Approx. 1.5 years ago the chronic pain and discomfort started.

Sometimes it feels like reduced blood flow to the region? My penis often feels ""cold"" and shrunken. Not like how I remember it just a few years ago.

One year ago I did see a urologist and he checked my prostate and said it was of normal size, however, I had masturbated to ejaculation right before seeing him so maybe the reduced semen volume led to a misdiagnosis? I was however retaining urine in my bladder after urinating, which caused it to be inflamed. I was put on a course of ciprofloxacin, flomax. Did not relieve symptoms.

I can no longer afford to see a urologist. I am at a loss for help. Are there exercises or supplements that would help? Has anyone experienced this?",AskDocs,t3_dksjsa

Hey guys, I’m (23yo, 5ft. 9in., 265lbs) trying to make some changes toward a healthier lifestyle. I just found out recently I’m pre-diabetic (it’s likely I have been undiagnosed for a long time). I know that diagnosis isn’t necessarily a life sentence but I want to stop it and work on correcting it before it becomes permanent and progresses to diabetes. My father has diabetes that runs in his family and my mom has insulin resistance and thyroid problems that run in hers So I know I’m probably more prone to these problems but working on not letting that happen. I’ve been given a chance by catching this early and I need some direction as it seems to have gotten worse at my A1C 3 month check up. My metabolism is very low and I can go days without eating or feeling hunger (it’s improved a little bit more recently). I’ve seen a nutritionist and have been doing okay with the Mediterranean diet, and I was seeing a personal trainer who I stopped seeing recently because she was just not a good fit for me as she motivated her clients with insults and guilting them and I need positive motivation. 

My mother said I should check out a weight loss clinic like she had done in the past??? They apparently have some vitamin B injections I can take and pills (fentermine? I think it was)??? Anybody have any experience with that? I know that’s just a temporary fix, but is that something good to start with while I work on changing lifestyles?

More importantly-long term; What are some daily exercises I can start doing and incorporate into my routine? Things I can do at my desk at work?  Any idea of foods/vitamins/supplements I can start putting in my diet to help lower my A1C and burn fat?

Long story short, I’m trying to figure out what’s going on with my heart. As soon as I get up out of bed in the morning, my heart rate will jump up to anywhere between 90-130bpm and will not come down from there unless I sit (then tapers off into the 80s) or lay down (this is when it returns to the 60s/70s). Climbing stairs I stay around 110-120 and moving any faster than a brisk walk gets me into the 140s.

I wear a Fitbit when I go to bed and as I’m asleep my heart rate hangs around 56-64. Seems normal enough.

I don’t necessarily feel palpitations until my heart goes above 120. Once in a while I feel a skipped beat.

Taking a multivitamin and multimineral with focus on magnesium has helped me with reconditioning enough to be able to return to full time work and most activity.

So after some moderate exercise (maybe vigorous intensity) for about 15ish minutes, I took my blood pressure directly after. I checked it a couple times within 10 minutes of finishing the workout, and my blood pressure was around 115/75 give or take. 

My resting blood pressure is around 130/80 give or take in any direction. I was under the impression blood pressure would be higher after exercise, not lower. I also notice after some pretty vigorous workouts, I get a little lightheaded upon standing for like 30 minutes after the workout.

"Stomach pain that lasted for hours but then stopped suddenly.I’m 18f and in college. I’m 5 feet 4 in, about 135 pounds. I’ve never smoked or consumed alcohol. I’m also not on my menstrual period.

This morning I woke up at like 9 and with some stomach pain. I didn’t think it was bad until I tried to go to the bathroom and I had to walk hunched over. The pain was so bad I couldn’t stand up straight. I didn’t feel constipated or like I had to vomit. It was just a stabbing pain near my lower abdomen. 

I would have gone to my college’s health center but it’s closed today. This pain lasted until 3:30. A little before 3:30 I decided to take my chances and eat something because I thought maybe I’m just hungry (the last time I ate was 8pm the night before). I ate exactly 2 cashews. Right after the pain got a lot worse and then all of a sudden it stopped. 

I don’t know if it will come back, but it really scared me. This has never happened before. I’ll probably visit the health center tomorrow if it comes back. Could this really have just been hunger? Thanks!",AskDocs,t3_dkp0p7
"Vertigo has taken a really big toll on my life, does anyone have any thoughts based on my story?I'm a 40 white male and have had problems with vertigo for over 10 years, but in recent times it's been taking a much bigger toll on me.  Sometimes it's positional and resembles BPPV (usually looking down/up or laying on one side or the other).  But mostly I just feel like I'm rocking on a boat all day, every day.  Or my head is bobbing on the ocean in the waves.  

Then, occasionally, I'll have these brief, very intense vertigo spells....I sometimes feel like I have a surge of electricity in my head and then some intense spinning and disorientation for maybe 1 to 4 seconds.  Just yesterday, I parked my car and was walking in a park with my kid, and it looked like the whole Earth started rocking back and forth, spinning, and the disorientation and associated anxiety hit me.  Took about 10 seconds to recover, but felt extra ""rocky"" on my feet for the next 30 mins or so.

I feel spaced out/disconnected all the time and a bad sense of smell.  I have frontal headaches.  Every once in a while, one of my ears will suddenly feel ""full"" I lose the hearing slightly and hear a ringing, then this sensations fades over the next 10 seconds.  No one understands that when I describe it to them, and sometimes I question myself too.  

A number of years ago, I saw an Oto Neurologist who did a specialized MRI and also attempted to do caloric testing (cold water in my ears).   I called off the caloric testing because it caused me to have such bad vertigo they had to stop the test before it really began.

On my MRI I have a stable 3.5 centimeter osteoma above my left eye in my skull, but everyone I've seen has insisted that lesion isn't the cause, so I've forgotten about that.

This is taken a big toll on me.  My work has suffered...I travel for business, and am always background nervous to travel alone.  I used to be a private/recreational pilot and can no longer fly, obviously.  I hate this.

"Worried about radiation from x-rays and CT scan30M, 5'6"", 125lbs, caucasian.

A  few days ago I had 3 x-rays on my lumbar spine. I was supposed to have 2  x-rays: one lying on my back and another one lying on my side. The  technician told me that we had to repeat the one lying on my back,  because the image wasn't good enough for a proper diagnosis. I asked him  what happened, and he told me that we really had to repeat the x-ray,  because my body position wasn't properly aligned, and he also told me  that's something that normally happens, and so he aligned me again in  the machine by moving me around using my feet and then repeated the  test. Before doing the x-rays the technician told me I didn't have to  remove any of my clothes (even though there was a medical gown in the  dressing room), he just told me to leave everything that was metallic,  and my watch, wallet and phone in the dressing room.

Is  this normal procedure? I took the exam with my shorts and polo shirt  on. Wasn't I supposed to wear the medical gown instead? Is it normal to  have repeated the x-ray exam in these conditions? I had to do 3 lumbar  x-rays instead of 2. My doctor asked me to do these x-rays + an MRI on  my lumbar spine, because I've been having a lot of pain in my lumbar and  left leg as soon as I walk more than 10 minutes. I've been having this  pain for 4 months.

I am very  concerned about the radiation, because I also had to do a x-ray and CT  scan on my cervical spine in January of the current year, due to a lot  of pain in the back of my head and on my shoulders (I ended up being  diagnosed with cerebellum tonsils herniation). I also did one spine  x-ray in April of 2018, but in this x-ray exam I was standing. I did  this because I was also having back pain at the time and my doctor  thought I had scoliosis, but she then told me it wasn't serious.  Finally, I also did a x-ray on my hands in August of 2018, because the  joints of my fingers were very swollen, red and hurt while typing on the  keyboard.

I had a sore throat when we left home on Wednesday, but it went away after Friday. Today is Sunday, and i woke up feeling like i had something in my throat. I looked in the mirror, and saw a white thing that i assumed was a seed or something stuck on my throat. Used my finger to wipe it away, and saw it was a clump of white hard mushy-ish stuff that smelled like bad breath. (Had never seen anything like it)

I looked again and saw a little hole where it had been, on the right of my throat, close to my uvula. (Ehat im guessing is one of the tonsils?)
I poked it a bit to see what it was, and drained a bunch more of the white hard stuff out (maybe puss? Ive never seen puss HARD before).

Its the only spot like that. Its just a little hole now, no more puss. But it really freaked me out. 
My throat hurts again. And the spot in my throat with the little hole hurts the most.
Otherwise im fine. Ive had a stomach ache (could just be from the travelling) and i feel tired, but i don’t have a fever, and i can breathe normally.

I googled it, and it looks like something called a Peritonsillar Abscess. (I usually go straight to the doctor, but we are on vacation and there aren’t many docs available here).

"Tachycardia, especially while standing, more likely after drinking alcohol.I am a white male, 28 years old, 6ft tall and 185lbs, non-smoker but I use dipping tobacco daily. For several years I have noticed a relatively fast heart rate and recently I got a Fitbit and have been keeping a closer eye on it. Fitbit says my resting heart rate is around 63-69bpm (usually only this low while I’m sleeping or just after waking up), this usually increases to around 85-100bpm when sitting, 95-115bpm while standing and 110-120bpm while walking. However, sometimes it will be around 80-100 when I’m laying down resting and go up to 145 or even 165 when I stand up (but am not walking or exercising or anything). I don’t really notice other symptoms when my heart rate is going this fast, other than being annoyed by the fast heart rate itself. My pulse feels regular but fast to me when I check it. Triggers for this type of fast heart rate while just standing seem to be consuming alcohol (or the day after drinking) even if I only have around 5 or 6 alcoholic drinks, though sometimes there’s no obvious trigger. I used to have anxiety, which I’ve learned to control through daily meditation and treating my adhd properly, but I still have a fast heart rate, I’m just not anxious about it. This makes me think that the heart rate might not be anxiety related as I previously thought, especially considering I’m not anxious at all after a few drinks but it still happens. About 3 or 4 years ago I went to the doctor and had a stress test, echocardiogram and wore a heart monitor for 48 hours. The results came back normal, however I didn’t drink any alcohol during that time and on the days I wore the monitor my heart felt totally normal. I’ve heard of POTS and think that I could possibly fit that diagnoses, in which case I’ll just try to improve my cardiovascular fitness and not worry about it. I am just wondering if this type of occasional increase in heart rate can be considered normal (or at least not a cause for concern after a couple drinks) or if I should go back to the doctor. Is there any way I could have developed a new arrhythmia in the last few years or had one all along that wasn’t picked up on the tests before? Would the stress test/echocardiogram have picked up any electrical problems with my heart? I take 30mg Vyvanse daily for adhd but I’m 100% sure that this medication isn’t the cause of my tachycardia as I noticed it well before I started the meds and its just as likely to happen on days where I don’t take it. 

TLDR; heart rate occasionally goes to 165bpm while simply standing up, a few alcoholic drinks makes this quite likely to happen. Is this reason enough to go back to the doctor and have my heart checked again or should I stop worrying about it and just try to improve my cardio and limit alcohol intake?",AskDocs,t3_dko5lc
"Knee injury post ACL reconstruction29M, 6’2”, 260, Caucasian. No drinking since incident. No smoking, drugs at all.

Tore my ACL, MCL and meniscus at the age of 14 playing American football. Had reconstructive surgery at age 16. Went back to contact sports within a few months.

Aside from knowing when storms are coming, I’ve had no issues until squatting at work, hearing a loud pop and having instant swelling, pain and bruising at the end of July.

I was referred to an orthopaedic specialist by the urgent care facility I visited the day of the incident.  On my first visit, the doctor made note of the lasting bruise, swelling and buckling while walking. The insurance company sent me to their facility for an MRI, which the doctor said was of subpar quality. I was sent for physical therapy to ‘focus on pain management.’ I was then sent for a second MRI, the results showing excessive fluid, arthritis and damage to the graft.

On my most recent visit, the insurance company had sent a case manager to sit in on the visit. The doctor now says that ‘nothing is wrong,’ despite the inflammation, bruising, pain and buckling still being present three months later. I have been taking maximum doses of ibuprofen and acetaminophen to deal with pain since the day of the incident.

They opted to continue physical therapy, but are not offering insight on what the true issue is. What could be leading to the inflammation, bruising and buckling still being present after so long? How do I move forward to pursue a permanent fix rather than a temporary band-aid? Is there anything I can be doing different to better this situation?

I decided to see my chiropractor and during the adjustment he went to manipulate my neck and it didn’t want to pop so he tried again and I had some pain. Went home and the next morning I had tension headaches which persisted in the meantime I saw my chiropractor weekly/biweekly. Went to my doctor she prescribed Prozac(to no effect) and stretches which for the last 2 months I have been doing religiously. Two weeks ago for four days the tension headaches were nearly nonexistent I would have a twinge here and there. Again I went to the chiropractor and my neck didn’t pop so he tried again and the tension headaches returned but now I have some dizziness/lightheaded it’s vague and I have been waking up in the middle of the night with difficulty falling back asleep and I feel a bit like a bobble head. I work construction and the dizziness is does not affect my mobility as I am not unsteady if that makes any sense. 

Im at my wits end with this. Obviously I’m going to stop seeing my chiropractor. What should I do? I have an MRI scheduled. Should I be loading up on anti-inflammatories? Get Prolotherapy? Is it something else I might be missing?",AskDocs,t3_dkntpc

"29F Thyroid supplement side effectsAge: 29
Height: 5""4
Medications: none currently
Smoker: no
Previous issues: various gastrointestinal 

I'm looking to find out if any doctors have seen something like this. A week ago i took the last of a bottle of Nutri Thyroid, an apparently hormone free thyroid glandular supplement. This was recommended by a naturopath who said my test numbers were sub-clinical. Two hours after taking the final dose I was sitting in bed watching a music video when my HR shot up to about 154bpm out of nowhere and I got bad chest pains. Called an ambulance, ECG fine, so no hospital stay. Since then I had developed surges of anxiety and high HR, hair thinning/loss, leg cramps and hot flashes. I've also had irregular periods since I started the supplement, skipped one and current cycle is late. Are these freeze dried thyroid supplements truly hormone free? Could they have caused this? I've had heart palpitations and irregular temperatures this weekend. How long will it take for the extra hormones from the supplement to get out of my system if so?

I have also read this in regards to it

This began in 2012 out of the blue. I started feeling like I needed to take constant deep sighing breaths and yawning even when I was not tired. Also I have a constant feeling in my solar plexus area of 'excitement' like when you have been stimulated by the 'fight or flight' response. It never goes away.
It's very hard to go to sleep and I usually take an otc sleep aid called  'ZZZQuill' to help me get to sleep, when it's really bad (like now) I actually have to wake up in the middle of the night to get those 'deep sighing' breaths in and then of course my sleep is ruined and makes the other symptoms even worse.
I don't drink caffeine or smoke and have been on a diet since Aug and lost 20ibs so eating as healthy as I can, no junk foods.
I did try to do a sleep study but it was impossible due to the way this condition makes me want to constantly sigh and yawn so was unable to complete it. I've worn one of those 'Holter' monitors and there was nothing abnormal with my heart recorded. Been tested for Asthma and it's not that or a restriction in my airway.
I'm embarrassed to talk to the doctors now as it's a really weird bunch of symptoms and in the past when I brought it up they had a glazed look in their eyes and I felt crazy for even talking about it. But it's real and been the bain of my life since 2012. Appreciate any help.",AskDocs,t3_dk6fqs

"Spontaneous Bilateral VAD - no trama, chiro etc hx32 - female white
non smoker, no drugs, no alcohol
5'7 - 270 - recently lost 50 plus lbs and going

Meds including what's been started since stroke Friday AM:

30 cortef total daily spaced over 4 doses during day (15,10,2.5,2.5)
.2mg Florinef daily
15 mg Buspar BID
100 mg zoloft daily
40 meq Effor-K BID
75mg Plavix daily
120mg Lovenox BID
8 mg zofran every 6-8 hrs pnr chronic nausea
50mg phenagren every 8 prn chronic nausea

Cause of chronic nausea unknown

Friday around 230am I had a stroke, it didn't show up on CT or CTA but the MRI w/contrast confirmed the stroke. The MRI also showed bilateral VAD, I was told that on both sides it starts at the base and goes about halfway their length.  Stroke affected right side - arm weakness/hard to move, foot drop and dragging leg to walk, numb/pins and needles entire right side from the midline over. As well as memory (epically failed the cognitive test they gave me) as well as word searching 

My stroke symptoms randomly get a million times worse even with lovenox and plavix then just as fast go back to the baseline have atm from the stroke. Plavix dose times were noon Friday and Saturday. Lovenox dose is 120mg. Allergic to ASA so that wasnt started - neurology said might need to bring immunology in to desensitize so can be started on it  So even with meds/treatment I'm having TIA's. I was under the impression Plavix started lowering TIA/stroke risk after about 3 hours and lovenox 4 hours with therapeutic levels being reached after 3 doses - So is it normal still symptomatic and having frequent TIA'S?

When Neurology came in I was told diagnosis and that from the scan they looked stable so approach that will be most likely is rescan in 2-3 weeks to see if healing has started and if so monitor closely that healing if not stent. No known event to trigger and neurology suspects and undiagnosed under lying condition is at the root given I'm diagnosed with POTS and Mast Cell Activation Disorder/Syndrome. Also have primary adrenal insufficiency (negative for autoimmune cause on  3 antibodies tests) and have a hx of torn ligaments two to the point reconstruction needed. Hx of saddle PE unprovoked/no known cause August 2016, AC therapy for a year then off as all hematological testing normal. Also have had a DVT cause complication of PICC line during pregnancy, PICC was for treating hyper emesis.

 How is it stable if I'm been having TIA's since the initial stroke with meds? Like so many TIA's I've lost count.

I've been low blood pressures (one I remember was 110/49 last one 108/56) and resting heart rate around 100-110 - I rest a tad high typically at 90-100 so only slightly off my norm  (once the ER got it down and I was transfer to a room I was over 200 in the ambulance). Around 11am Saturday morning it shot up to averaging 140 with jumps as high as 200 with strings of PVCs, ekg done confirming sinus tachycardia. 2 doses of an IV med to bring it down - the m beta blocker forgive me I cant remember its name keep word searching on it (and many words) and an oral dose of same med it stubbornly absolutely refused to budge any and go down. They were limited on how much of the beta blocker they could give me in fear of dropping my blood pressure. This got me transferred to Cardiac PCU around 7pm.

After 3 hours later they finally got it to a more tolerable rate in the 120s and I fell asleep about midnight. Cardiac PCU used the same med but in smaller frequent doses to achieve heart rate decreases but not cross the to much for my blood pressure and have it go even lower.

Wake up around 5 - heart racing, feels like going to jump out of my chest, rate fluctuating lightning fast between 130 to 170. Up then down then stay in the 160s then down then back up constantly big swings. Neck also hurts a TON worse then went to sleep went from 5-9 on a 0-10 scale and severe nausea. Nurses get it back down with same approach and fluids.

No one has commented on why it's so crazy high just that cardiology was called to consult.

So now I'm awake  on less then 5 hours sleep watch the monitor cause it occasionally beeps and flashes yellow/red cause even with the beta blocker it's going above their parameters sometimes. That's when I noticed it, My jump in heart rate is a direct relation to how I'm sitting/laying and the angle my shoulders and neck is at. The pain is causing major nausea.

Cardiology hasn't seen me yet just my telemetry and written orders.

To my non-medical professional self my theory on that is going on with heart rate is the amount of occlusion on both sides is significant enough to be stressing my heart leading to the tachycardia and as long as simply treated with medication therapy the tachycardia is going to remain. Neurology pulled in Neurovascular for consult. I'm worried my logic is correct and today at rounds the game plan is going to change to the stent surgery urgently vs seeing if heal on own as they said most do. I don't want to be blindsided though so would this be a logical approach to expect presented to me today? If not what are your thoughts on what's going on and what I can expect the next few days? 

I've attached the one image of my MRI I have. The neurology yesterday said that on both sides it starts at the base of my arteries around the shoulder and the dissections stop somewhere roughly around ear level/rough half the length of the arteries. The left side is the worst as its completely occluded in spots, the right side he said is pretty much that level of blockage for the length of it with two places a little wider. 
(Nevermind it won't let me put the pic I'll try in comments otherwise message me and I can send that way) The right is a small pin point of black 

With my pain worsening significantly during the night in intensity as well as how much of my neck hurts, the elevated resting heart rate, and me noticing heart rate directly impacted by certain head positions when laying down/sitting up resting head against bed what is the likelyhood in  you the responders personal opinion that I'm going to end up with a repeat MRI w/contrast to check on the status as well as chances things changed/ got larger?",AskDocs,t3_dkjpt9

Anyways, anytime I feel something is wrong, my mom brushes it off and gives me the most random/useless advice. She doesn't ever take me to see a doctor unless I ask her a dozen times for a single visit, but even that doesn't always guarantee a visit.

Some examples of my mom brushing things off are I once had diarrhea and unpleasant stomach aches for 8 days in a row despite there being no change in my usual diet, but my mom said to just drink water. Also, I've been constipated my entire life, but my mom says it's because I don't eat enough vegetables even though I do eat them, am not a picky eater, and no one else in the family deals with constant constipation. I asked her to take me to a doctor, and she did. The doctor recommended fibre in a powder form, but that didn't help. I asked my mom to take me again, but she then just told me to drink tea. 

The problems I've been dealing with have mostly either been an ongoing problem for the past fee years or my entire life is my knee and elbow joints shifting out of place, constipation like I've mentioned, emetophobia, a constant feeling of tiredness and fogginess (though it may be because of my depression) and some mental illnesses such as depression, social anxiety, and an eating disorder. I don't think what I'm dealing with is anything extremely alarming that needs to be dealt with ASAP, but it would be nice to have these problems solved. 

I know I can go to the family doctor myself because I'm 16 for crying out loud, but my social anxiety makes it mentally difficult and extremely stressful to book an appointment myself and go there myself which is why I'd like someone, preferably my mom, to help me out, but she doesn't take my concerns seriously which had lead to problems piling up over the years.

__________________________________


A long-term IBS-D, SIBO, Candida sufferer here. For many years I have struggled with bloating, excessive intestinal gas, cramps, abdominal discomfort/pain, physical weakness, brain fog and so on after virtually every meal (no matter what I ate). 

Recently I started drinking a glass of red wine before/during my meals and it seems to alleviate 90-100% of my symptoms. First I attributed this effect to the chemical compounds found in wine. Then I decided to try some alcohol-free wine to test my theory and see if it had the same effect. My symptoms were back! Therefore, it simply has to be the alcohol in wine that alleviates my symptoms.

A little bit of further research revealed that red wine is a strong stimulant of gastric acid secretion and gastrin release. Does this mean my stomach is deficient in stomach acid?

I am due to get a CT scan of my sinuses tomorrow and was worried about another CT scan as I had a big hitter, the chest, abdomen and pelvis done this year in April or May. I know sinus CT scans are relatively low dose but I found out after that the CAP CT scan I've already had done is equivalent to 7-8 years background radiation. Are CAP CT scans dangerous and would it be wise to get another CT scan tomorrow?

This has all been to do with sinus issues, I was coughing up blood before they knew it was sinus related and that's why the CAP CT scan was ordered. I'm a bit worried that I've done unnecessary damage and will do more tomorrow",AskDocs,t3_dkk1qo

So in advance i apologise if this is something that everyone has, and i know it’s a very unimportant question, so again - sorry.

Anyways, I’ve had this thing for about 4 years where my voice is constantly slightly rough, and quite unstable (as in i can’t hold a note while singing for more than a quarter of a second). 
But, when i do a normal cough, or clear my voice, it comes out much smoother i can hold notes for longer and such too. This effect only lasts for a second, so i’m not sure what it is as i always want to do it when i’m singing or humming to myself, but i know i shouldn’t as it’s probably bad for my throat to cough.

I was just wondering what causes this - is there a way to deal with it etc.

tl:dr - my voice becomes clearer/smoother for a second after coughing - what is it?

Thanks.

"20F a week of persistent nauseaNote: I posted this a few hours ago but got no replies. I'd really like a reply so I'm posting it again. I hope I'm not breaking rules. I also added some pertinent info. 

This will likely be lengthy but I would be beyond grateful if someone can help me in any way. 
Tldr: I haven't eaten in a week and feel nauseous af, help! 

I am a 20 yo female, caucasian and I live in Europe. I have a history of feeling nauseous quite often, and apparently polycystic ovaries. I also have some mental issues for sure, but I have only just gotten a psychological test done and won't be seeing a psychiatrist until next month. My issues have mostly to do with anxiety, depression, and poor emotion control. I also smoke weed, but haven't done so since my troubles started last week.

Now on to the issue.

I haven't eaten a proper meal since last Tuesday. On Wednesday I woke up early for college, had some coffee, and left the house. I realized I don't feel well on my commute but since I have a history of feeling sick, and I have been slightly nauseous daily since college started, I didn't pay much attention to it. I started worrying when I literally couldn't swallow a bite of a pastry I bought that I usually quite like. I ended up leaving college early that day and going home, hoping it passes.
It didn't.

In the following days I visited my doctor, who upon reading my psych evaluation said it was in my head bc I'm stressed and to go home, relax, and eat.
The next day I also went to my gynecologist. She did a vaginal ultrasound and yet again sent me on my way, saying it's polycystic ovaries.
Now, my last period was 3rd-10th October and I had sex with my bf on the 2nd and the 10th. Of course, I'm horrified of being pregnant because I can't think of anything else that would cause me to feel this way for this long.

Other than the nausea, my hands and feet are sweaty and cold but that could just be from not eating. My breasts feel slightly larger than usual but they don't hurt at all. And I had pains in my ovaries last night that somewhat persist into today. I also have some back pain. 

Today, I've been trying to eat 1 mashed banana and 1 mashed apple mixed together for 5 hours now. I feel full after every bite, and have diarrhea after approx every 5 bites. I'm also very weak. 
I was forced by family members to eat a tiny piece of fish with bread, which I barely managed. 

I did blood tests 2 or so months ago and they came back perfectly healthy, only my red cell count was slightly elevated.
My mother thinks I should just force myself to eat, but when I try it feels like I'm already full and if I keep forcing myself I just feel more nauseous. I have been drinking ginger and chamomile tea.

The thing is, my throat never got worse than that ""funny"" feeling and even when the headache was the strongest and my nose was constantly running it kind of just went away. These symptoms all disappeared by Tuesday. Now I didn't take any medication against this because I figured it would just go away on its own and I felt worst on the weekend and couldn't go to the doctor anyway. Yesterday, on Saturday, so 10 days after me initially having a funny feeling in my throat, the same feeling returned. Overnight, it progressed into a sore throat but none of the other symptoms popped up. My nose is completely free and I have no headache.

"Had a bad experience getting my first IUD inserted. Completely lost confidence in the nurse that did it. Now I'm unsure whether how much of my (23F) bleeding is normal.I am Canadian, 23F, have never had children, never been pregnant nor had an abortion, regular periods that are a little on the heavy side. On Friday, I had a Copper IUD (the Mona Lisa 5 Standard) inserted by a nurse practitioner at my doctor's office. My doctor was on holidays. 

Background to why I chose a copper IUD: After a 4 month stint using hormonal birth control (the lowest dosage possible on the market) I got almost every single negative side effect you could get for using it. I didn't have a single period the entire time. Severe depression, racing heartbeat, weight gain, extreme mood swings, dry hair, I developed an anxiety disorder accompanied by panic attacks, sore breasts, swelling ankles. We didn't expect it was the pill at first, we just thought I was going crazy. 

I was becoming a danger to myself and there was talk of having me admitted somewhere. I couldn't do my job, despite rigorous cognitive behavioural therapy, and I had to be put on medical leave from work until I sorted myself out. I forgot to take my pill one day and in a mood-swinged panic, which was common for me at the time, I called my boyfriend hysterical. He suggested that it might be the birth control and said that for now it might be better if I stopped taking it. Just to see if it made a difference. So I did. 

4 days later, I was anxiety free. 2 weeks later, I still had some concentration issues but for the most part I was back to normal. My therapist noted this without prompting when I went to see her. 4 weeks later I was back to work like nothing had happened. 6 weeks later and here we are!

Since that pill was the lowest dosage, I became extremely wary of hormonal birth control in any form. My GP (I love her a lot) was really great about talking to me about all the forms of birth control out there. We eventually decided on a copper IUD. I was nervous about having the device inserted, but my doctor answered all of mine and my BFs questions. She made us feel very comfortable with the idea but made sure I knew the risks and what to expect afterwards. But that was two weeks ago and I didn't take notes...I also have questions I hadn't thought of at the time. 

The nurse destroyed my confidence: the nurse that inserted it was a complete air-head. She had never inserted a copper one before, so she made a big deal about it, even going so far as to act irritated with me for not choosing the Mirena. She flicked through the physician instruction pamphlet before 'uggh'-ing at me because 'theres like a million instructions here' and said she was going to talk to the clinic's other doctor (since mine was on holiday). She slammed the door on her way out and left me sitting there for a really long time. The confidence my doctor had built for the procedure crumbled the longer I sat there. I kept telling myself that it couldn't be that different of an insertion from the Mirena, so I'm sure the nurse would be just fine. I just had to stay calm and not over-react. By the time she came back I'd almost cried and walked out twice. During the procedure she kept saying things like 'lets try this' or 'hmmmm I can't get through' or 'thats not right'. I'm pretty sure I've had my cervix clamped open before and I know it doesn't feel great but DAMN DID IT HURT. I have high pain tolerance and I screamed a bit when she did it. Then at the end of the proceedures, when I tried to ask about how to check and make sure it was in place or how much bleeding I should have, she dismissed my questions. Handed me a maxi-pad and told me to have a good day. 

So yeah, she completely shattered my confidence. 

The amount of blood I'm having I would describe as 'heavy spotting'. Over the course of 24 hours, I will need to change the pad I've been using (which are regular) twice. I have not been having any pain or cramping since yesterday morning.

I want to know: how long is this heavy spotting supposed to last? When I google it, it says to expect spotting for 3-6 months but what I'm experiencing is not typical 'spotting' like the website describes. I've read almost everything I can find online but nothing answers my exact question. 

Also, do you know if I would be able to have a gynecologist take my IUD out when the time comes? Can or will gynecologists do that? I've never been to one before (my doctor has done all my paps etc.) but I'm going to be making an appointment with my doctor when she gets back and I'd like to discuss the possibility of getting referred to a gynecologist when it needs to come out. 

My IUD will last 5 years but my BF and I are looking at children in about 3 so having it taken out is already on my mind. Especially since I REALLY don't want to have it done at my clinic again.",AskDocs,t3_dki94k

Medical History: C8 radiculopathy, degenerative disc disease (cervical and lumbar spine) with subclinical myelopathy in cervical spine, hypertonia (neck and back), raynaud's phenomenon (hands and feet)

Current meds: Adderall for ADHD, iron and vitamin c supplements for anemia, flexeril as needed for muscle spasms, melatonin for sleep (occasionally)

&amp;nbsp;

So I'm not sure if this sub is the right place for this question, but I feel like it will get more reasonable and informed responses. I included my medical history in the rare chance that this might be related, though I have no real reason to believe that it is. For the last 3 days, I have felt an almost constant sense of vibration, almost as if there was a huge truck parked outside my house or a low-flying plane going by, making the floor vibrate. It's worse at night when I'm lying down, but it's constant throughout the day, as well. When it's quiet, I could swear that I even hear the rumbling, low frequency noise you'd typically associate with these kinds of vibrations. 

&amp;nbsp;

Of course, I assumed that there really must be something nearby in the neighbourhood making this noise and vibration, except when I mentioned it, nobody else in my house hears or feels it. I've gone so far as to go outside and walk around and cannot pinpoint a source at all. Nobody else notices it, so I can only assume I'm hallucinating it or something? Only I have no medical history of mental health issues except depression, which has been managed pretty well for a long time now. It's kind of starting to drive me nuts, as it's just low-key annoying and shows no sign of letting up. 

&amp;nbsp;

Possibly unrelated, but I had a bad cold virus a few months back that caused an ear infection (I lost hearing in one ear completely for a couple of weeks) and what a neurologist determined was likely just a post-viral neurological reaction that caused total numbness of my scalp for a couple of weeks and numbness/tingling that comes and goes in my scalp, face, neck and upper torso since then. This is mildly annoying, but I don't have any related pain or anything, so it's whatever. I'll probably follow up with the neurologist at some point, but I'm wondering if this vibration thing could be related to a sensory issue that could possibly cause both of these weird things? 

&amp;nbsp;

I know it's probably not a huge deal, but it's annoying enough to want to get to the bottom of it and I'm looking for more information before I make an appointment to see my GP with only vague, crazy sounding descriptions of sensations to describe to her.

\- Total: 4.3 mmol, HDL: 1.1 mmol, LDL: 3.0 mmol

As I said in the previous post, what made me have another cholestrol test was because my optician found lipid deposits around my corneal arcus. What changed over the last 5 years is that i started eating alot more unhealthy and stopped exercising, I also went from 155 pounds to 171 pounds. However i was still pretty active because of my occupation(averaging about 15000 steps on weekdays). So what I am wondering is:

Can the change in cholestrol happen just from diet, lack of exercise and a slight weight gain or should i be worried about something else? I have read that diet and lifestyle changes only change up to 20% of cholestrol levels. I have also read that diabetes can cause a dramatic change, but there is no diabetes running in my family.

"[22m] Several areas of musculoskeletal pain occurring simultaneously without discernable causeHi, I’m a 22 year old white male college student at a very rural university that recently got rid of its on-campus clinic. Unfortunately, this means my only option for treatment locally would be at the hospital down the road.

I may workout harder than i should, but not a single one of these sites of pain came from any known incident.

I’m having pain in the right side of my neck, made worse by tilting my head to the right, and turning my head to the right. I also have a lump right around where the pain is, which I’ve seen a doctor about in the past as it’s been there for years. It hasn’t gotten any bigger, and the doctor said it was too close to nerves to safely remove.

Secondly, I’m having pain just to the right of my thoracic region in my back, kind of in between the spine and the shoulder blade. It hurts to breathe in deeply, and hurts even worse to breathe in deeply while laying down. I have not seen a doctor about this. 

Thirdly, i’m having chronic lower back pain that won’t subside even with stretching of the hamstrings, quads, and hip flexors. And foam rolling my glutes, lower back, and upper back.

I’m also having a weird pain on the inside of my elbow after workouts, if I flex my bicep it’ll seize up and lock my forearm against my upper arm. 

Lastly, I’m having lateral side knee pain randomly, and the joint feels slightly unstable when this pain occurs.

Writing this out makes me annoyed because of just how much is happening all at the same time with no discernible cause. I can’t even get a good nights rest at this point because of it and it’s beginning to effect my performance academically.

On two occasions, about two months apart, I have gone to one specific restaurant in town with a small group of friends. On both occasions, within twenty minutes of arriving, I experienced an EXTREMELY sudden and overwhelming feeling as though I would promptly faint i.e. blurred vision, lightheadedness, extreme nausea. The first time, I quickly ran out of the restaurant and threw up and immediately felt better and went home. The second time, I quickly packed my belongings and walked outside where I sat down and waited for it to pass, which it did in about 1 minute. I had no return or ongoing symptoms whatsoever, in either case.

I have been to lots of other restaurants in the meantime and nothing like this has happened. I also haven't had this happen to me in any other scenario.

I was sober on both occasions. I am completely confused and don't want this to happen elsewhere or again!

"17F, had blood work done a few days ago, constant burning/tingling feeling throughout my arm and fingers. did the nurse blow a vein or did she nick my nerve? please help.I had blood work done just this past Thursday. 
I was sat down by the nurse and she had gone through all the correct steps before inserting the needle into my arm, but, upon the insertion I got a sharp, burning/tingling sensation that ran down my arm and into my fingers. At first I thought nothing of it, I figured that maybe she hit a sensitive spot in my arm and that’s what caused it.

I got home and everything was fine, that sensation was gone and I was able to use my arm and hand perfectly fine. Cut to the next day, I woke up and it felt like there was something  stuck on a small portion of my arm, kind of like a sticker, except there was nothing on it and it was quite numb when I tried to “rub it off” I thought it was strange but it didn’t hinder my everyday activities, so again I just brushed it off. 

But now today, the burning/tingling sensation is completely back in my arm and it’s pretty much stopping me from doing any form of activity. Anytime I straighten my arm, put any weight on it, lift something, (even something as light and picking my blanket up off me) pet my cat, rest my arm/let it hang to my side, turn a door handle, pretty much anything that requires any muscle strength. It’s a non-stop burning/tingling pain that just will not go away no matter what I do. Whenever I run my finger along where it’s burning/tingling it’s almost completely numb and I can barely feel my finger touching. The only thing I can feel is the burning/tingling sensation throughout my arm and fingers. 

I have brought this up to various family members and they’ve brushed it off as a blown vein, not to worry and that it should be ok in a few days. But Is it just that? Or is it something more serious?

My ALT is at 78 u/L, my AST is 30 u/L, and my ALP is at 107 u/L. According to the report these are all ""normal."" Everything else is normal except I have mildly elevated total protein (whatever that is) at 8.8 g/dL. The CT scan report is copied and pasted below:

History of Endometriosis, anxiety, depression, RRF

Greetings. On February the 8th I was officially diagnosed with Endometriosis via excision. My pain was fairly mild, but enough to cause me inconvenience in my day to day life. My doctor straight away suggested Endometriosis and got me into a gynaecologist who got me in to a laporoscopy a couple of months later. He found three benign cysts and a “very mild amount” of Endometriosis, he says. It was only found on my ovaries. Months had gone by. The first three months everything seemed... okay. My pain was not getting better, and actually felt worse since the day of my operation. My pain was around a 5 or more every day. 

My pain remained a stable 5 a couple of days every week, until the last four months where things rapidly got a lot worse. In May, I tested positive on three pregnancy tests, the next day it was negative. Doctors or hospitals couldn’t tell me why. My period is completely out of whack and extremely heavy. I pass clots that are roughly 1” in diameter and my periods can last up to 8 days. This is a first for me. Additionally, I’m in so much fucking pain. 

I always read about people with endometriosis who get flare ups that basically cripple them. They end up in a ball and can’t move. I was always so grateful that I never experienced that, but now I am. My pain radiates from either side of my uterus (I’m assuming from one ovary to the other) and then into my hips, my lower back and down my thighs. The pain is so bad that I sometimes feel like I’m actually dying. 

For pain relief, I was taking tramadol for some time, but didn’t enjoy the side effects. Then I was on thc which worked great in short bursts. The best thing I’ve found is a heat pack. But relieving my pain is just a patch up. I want to know why this is happening to me and my GP, who has been so incredible in the past, will not take further action until we reach the 12 month mark.

"[24M] Elevated ASO for Long Time, Unresponsive to TreatmentHi, sorry for the throwaway.

Thank you for reading through this.

Age: 24  
Sex: male  
Height: 178 cm (5'8"")  
Weight: 69 kg (152 lbs)  
Race: white  
Primary complaint: elevated ASO levels, unresponsive to treatment  
Existing medical issues: none  
Current medications and doses: 1,500,000 IU Penicillin every Friday  
Drinking: no, I haven't had any alcohol at all since starting the treatment (was drinking socially before)  
Smoking: I have stopped smoking in February this year. Prior to this, I have been smoking for about 9-10 years  
Recreational drugs: no

Result (ASO) | Date (DD.MM.YYYY) | Notes  
200    | 23.02.2016 |  
&lt;200  | 21.11.2017 | I guess this lab doesn't differentiate if &lt;200. That's exactly what it's written on the page.  
300    | 25.04.2019 |  
400    | 07.05.2019 |

360.2 | 06.09.2019 | See below  
455    | 06.09.2019 | I went to two different labs on this day, that's why two results. I just wanted to make sure.  
531    | 18.10.2019 |

Also, on 07.05.2019 they took a throat sample (no idea how it's called in English, the one where they use a cotton swab to collect stuff from inside the throat). Everything turned negative from this test.

The above table has all the ASO lab results extracted from all the records I have. They are from different labs across the city, depending on where I happened to have errands to run in that respective morning. Eventually, I found a lab I really like, so the last 3 results (573, 455, 531; except the 360.2 from the day I went to an extra lab) are from the same lab.

On 03.05.2019 (Friday) I started the treatment. I was prescribed an antibiotic that is called Moldamin. As far as I can tell, it contains 1,500,000 IU of Penicillin. I have been going to the hospital to get my shot every Friday (sometimes I would miss Friday, so I would go on Saturday morning). This Friday (18.10.2019) was my 24th shot.

I have been communicating with the same ENT doctor ever since I got the first out-of-bounds result on 25.04.2019. Every time I reported new lab results, she just told me to continue the treatment. Next week I am going to see her again (have been talking on the phone until now since I was prescribed the treatment), she said she wants to re-run the throat sample test.

I don't know if this is helpful at all, but I also looked through some PANDAS fact sheets/resources online. I have indeed noticed that my OCD was worse in the past year or so, and it's getting harder for me to control it. I have always had a bit of an OCD problem, but only in the past 1-2 years have I found myself opening and closing the wardrobe for more than 15 minutes and not being able to snap out of it. I'm not at the point where it's interfering with my daily activities, but I still hope it will get better and that it's related to this.

If you need any other info, please let me know.

RACE: White 

DURATION: About 10 days 

Hey guys, about a week and a half ago I believe I got gastritis. I went to the doctors to take a stool test &amp; it came back as negative for H Pylori, so I know it’s not a bacterial infection. My symptoms include severe stomach nausea only in the morning which lasts for a few hours. Because of this, I’ve been having serious trouble sleeping, as the nausea and pain wake me up within about 6 hours of sleeping. My doctor said it is acute gastritis however it’s been over a week and it still hasn’t gone away. It’s better than when it started, because when it started the nausea would be all day. Besides changing my diet, what can I do to get rid of this gastritis? It is extremely uncomfortable and annoying. 

Or could it be something else entirely? I took a blood and urine test to see if I have any sort of infection, however the results have not come yet. Any help would be appreciated.",AskDocs,t3_dkk3r7
"Coughing up a dark red mucus in the morningHello and thanks in advance for your opinions and assistance. 

I was sick about 2 weeks ago. Cough,Sore Throat, Runny Nose. Now I’m feeling better except I’m still very mucusy. The cause for concern is every morning, and sometimes in the middle of the night I feel the mucus draining and bubbling In my throat. So I have to cough it up and when I do it’s all dark red and bloody looking. It also tastes really bad. Leaves a really nasty taste in my throat. It only appears that way in the morning. Throughout the day when I spit up the mucus it’s just greenish or yellow. It has been bloody in the morning for about a week now. A little less. 

I went to the urgent care a couple days ago to get it checked out. I was concerned I had a lung infection or something. Especially after some googling of my symptoms. The doctor listened to my lungs and and looked at my nose and throat. And she said my nose looked a little irritated and red inside. There was a fire very close nearby recently (Southern California, Saddleridge) and a lot of ash settled in the valley we live. She said she’s been seeing that a lot. She prescribed me some antibiotics. She said not to take them unless it continues though, she wanted to save me a trip back just in case. But she said my lungs sounded fine. She said what’s probably happening is that while I lay down and my nasal mucus drains it getting stuck in my throat and breaking down. That’s why it’s turning reddish brown. 

I just wanted to hear what some other people might think. Especially after seeing what it looked like because I took pictures of the mucus this morning. I was not able to show this to the doctor.

"Colitis / infection / c-diff?I [32F] woke up on Tuesday morning with lower abdominal cramping and fluffy / mushy diarrhoea. Within the stool, and when wiping, there was bright red blood and a lot of mucus. Assuming it was just something I’d eaten I just tried to go about my day. 

By the time it got to Thursday and this hadn’t gone away, I had a phone consultation with my GP.  I’d now been going at least 10 times a day with fluffy, bloody mush with a kind of fish-like smell and intense pain so she requested I drop in a stool sample. I told her that I’d been prescribed metronidazole for a potential giardia infection and had finished taking them the prior Wednesday (6 days before the symptoms started). 

The next morning when I went the stool was partially solid but still full of blood and mucus and I was in a lot of pain. On explaining this to my GP and being almost hysterical on the phone because of the pain she sent me to A&amp;E. 

The doctors in A&amp;E did all my observations and said my haemoglobin was fine, I had no fever, my pulse was a bit high which could have been the pain, and they sent me on my way to wait for the stool sample to come back from my GP next week. 

It’s now Sunday and there has been no change real change and I can’t leave the house. I’m not really sure what I’m meant to be eating? There seems to be different views on if I should just be having a clear liquid diet, if I should be eating low residue foods etc. 

Could this be c-diff from the antibiotics? I’ve read that they won’t test stool for c-diff if it’s not liquid and the sample I gave wasn’t - even though it mainly has been. Or is it likely to be something else?

"Pelvic area/Prostate inflammation. It's driving me nuts!19M, 167cm, 68kg, brown

&amp;#x200B;

Primary complaint: (pelvic area/(prostate?)) inflammation due to rigorous masturbation

Duration: \~3 years.

Any existing medical issues: all of my tendons are inflammed as well

Current medications: none.

Smoking, drinking, etc: none.

Ever since puberty (\~12yo) I started masturbating by humping the bed sheets, making the bed sheet into a ""fleshlight"". The bed sheets always put pressure on my prostate (the area between my ballsack and anus) but I was too young to care.

&amp;#x200B;

This was done daily.

&amp;#x200B;

Up to now, at 19 years old, my prostate area feels ""damaged"". In no particular order, this is what I feel:

1. The prostate area (the area between my ballsack and anus) gets inflammed. (I feel burning in the muscle in addition to the symptoms which I will specify below worsen **after** I ejaculate after masturbation.)
2. The prostate muscles feel weak and ""stretched"" all the time. I can't describe it, but the best I can say is that I feel ""**discomfort**"" in that area.
3. Contracting (squeezing) the prostate area (like kegels) is hard to do. I can't squeeze that area hard enough, always flaccidly.
4. My erection is weak.
5. Abstaining from masturbation improves my symptoms, but I can't abstain for more than 5 days.
6. When I ejaculate I feel sharp burning in my prostate area in a specific ""vein-like"" area as if the ""semen"" channel is inflammed, but post-ejaculation all of the prostate gets inflamed.

Obviously, the way I masturbate has caused this. I tried to quit masturbating like this too many times but I always fail. But ever since 2 weeks, I started masturbating ""normally"", by laying on my back and using my hands instead of external objects, but the symptoms still worsen after ejaculating although less sever.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a virgin, so there is no possibility of an STD or alike.

&amp;#x200B;

I've notified and came out to my parents about all of this. My father told me to abstain from any form of masturbating for 90 days, and after 90 days of putting no pressure on my prostate area, he will take me to an urologist.

&amp;#x200B;

Things to mention: Ever since 2 years ago all of my tendons and joints (elbow tendon, shoulder tendon, kneecaps, and heels) inflamed, as if it is tendonitis (or maybe is it?). I visited a dozen doctors for this but all of them couldn't diagnose any medical condition and all of them prescribed me anti-inflammation pills for this. They never helped but I don't take those pills anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I am really worried about this. Not to diagnose myself, but I googled something called ""non-bacterial prostatis"" one of it's causes is called ""nerve damage in prostate area"". Could that be me?

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone shed light on what could possibly be causing this? I am gradually quitting masturbation. I already stopped masturbating dangerously and now I do it ""normally"" I also started gradually decreasing the frequency of ejaculating, and I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I will surely visit a urologist in the next 3 months. What to tell him?

Not currently sexually active but no previous history of STDs. No other symptoms other than those described.

I've had some issues with urinary urgency for a few months now but in the last 2 or so months, urgency has become accidents. At first I would feel a strong urge try to hold, and be unable to. It would happen maybe once every few days. Now, I rarely feel an urge first and am having accidents multiple times a day. I've had very few accidents at night/while sleeping and at first only had them when I was active but am beginning to have them while sitting down, lying down, etc.

I drink alcohol very occasionally, don't really drink caffeine, citrus or anything else that would irritate my bladder. I have been restricting my fluid intake because I can't have accidents during class but am continuing to drink when I can. Often, when I have accidents, especially if they're small, it will be accompanied by a very painful burning sensation.

I had an initial appointment with a GYN who prescribed an OAB drug which I've been on for 1.5 months now with no change. I started pelvic floor PT but feel like each time I go in, I've gotten worse and have less control over my pelvic floor even though I try to do the exercises I've been given.

Please take the time to read carefully, I appreciate it.My sexual history is very brief, I received unprotected blowjobs and open-mouth kissed 3 different sex workers on 28th June, 13th August, and 24th September. The last lady on the 24th of September, I VERY briefly performed unprotected cunnilingus and analingus on her. Nothing else happened with any of them, no sexual intercourse or anything.  


My symptoms began on the 25th of September, and they have been vague, meaning, could possibly be attributed to anything other than STDs. The one symptom that concerns me the most, is a feeling in my throat I never felt before in my life. It feels like something is lodged in the back of my throat, and it very mildly affects my swallowing. It's hardly a nuisance but it's noticeable.  Besides that I still get the odd sneeze, my eyes get kinda itchy every few hours, I have low appetite, and my stool is soft.   


After a ton of research I've decided to get tested for: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Syphilis, Trichomoniasis, Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma, EBV, and CMV.  


These tests will already cost me a fortune, but I'm willing to pay for the peace of mind.   


The issue is, I'd like to also get tested for Oral chlamydia and Oral gonorrhea, but like I said, the above is already going to cost me a fortune, so my question is, if I test negative for genital chlamydia and genital gonorrhea, is it safe to say it is highly unlikely to be found in my throat, considering the women gave me blowjobs and if they didn't pass it onto my genitals, there's no reason to think they passed it on to my throat?  


Also, what do you think of the STDs I'm planning to get tested for? Are they enough? Or am I going over the top and being a bit paranoid? I know I have that tendency for sure, I didn't have intercourse afterall.. I dont know.

"[20F] My body feels like it's rocking back and forth at night, can't sleepTwenty y/o female, 5'3, 140 lbs, white, ""all over"" sensation of rocking back and forth whenever it's bed time, unmedicated with no medical issues, no drugs/drinking

I've been dealing with this sensation for about a week now. I can't remember exactly when it started. Whenever I lay down in bed at night, no matter how I lay down, it feels like my bed is moving and shaking me. I've tried laying in other positions and it doesn't help. I can feel it even when I sit now. I'm sitting right now and I can feel myself slightly rocking back and forth. It goes on for hours. The sensation is the strongest in the lower half of my body, but I can generally feel it everywhere. I usually get in bed around 11 PM, I can't fall asleep until about 5:30, 6 AM because of it.

I live in a state where we never have earthquakes. I've tried asking other people in my home (not an apartment) to stop moving at night so much, all of them say they haven't been. I've sat on the floor at night and just watched my bed to see if it's moving, it's not. It's me.

This is driving me insane and whenever I google this issue, it either brings me to paranormal boards or posts about sleep paralysis. I'm not on the brink of sleep when this happens, and it happens all night. If anyone knows what this could be, please tell me.",AskDocs,t3_dkftfy

"21M Intestinal parasites causing acne and hair lossI’ve been dealing with this for quite some time now. It all started around two years ago when I ate uncooked meat and got pinworms. I know this for sure because I remember waking up in the middle of the night because my butthole was itching like crazy. Also I noticed I was pooping out small thread like worms the size of a tiny pin. 

I looked up the symptoms and found that I could get rid of the parasites by taking a dose of Albendazole 400mg. So I took about a pill daily for 3 days to make sure. 

The itching went away but I kept seeing the worms in my poop. It wasn’t really affecting me directly so I didn’t really care too much about it. It didn’t really hinder my life in anyway so I didn’t pay much attention to it despite continuously pooping out worms. I figured it would naturally go away. 

A few months ago I got the itching in my butthole again so I this time I took the Albendazole 400mg pills for 10 days in a row. The itching went away again but I kept seeing the worms. I still see the worms and recently I’ve been seeing bigger worms that even look like a different kind. They are like smaller versions of earthworms almost. much thicker than the pinworms but not long at all. 

Today i pooped out so many worms like 20-30 so i freaked out. 

I put some thought and came to a big realization. 
The past year I’ve been dealing with hair loss and acne. And now i’m beginning to think that the parasites are the root causes. I’ve been doing so much and used so many products to cure my acne and hair loss but I think i’ve been looking the wrong way. 

The problem is the parasites. 
So at this point it’s not a question of if I have them or not despite my butthole itching. 
It’s how the hell i’m supposed to rid of them. I dont think taking 20 or 100 albendazole pills are going to get rid of them. So my question is how can i get rid of them forever? 

Ive been looking at fasting and seeing that it may do the trick. Should i just fast for 20 days and see if that’ll work? Should I go and see a doctor? Please help.

"27 M heart attack and stent placement, followed by another stent 4 months later and still suffering with symptomsHi, I'm going to post a lot of information here. I really don't know where to turn. I'm hoping that I can just detail every part of my situation here and someone may be able to have some familiarity to give me some advice.

I had a heart attack almost 5 months ago at 27 years old. My symptoms were actually fairly mild. I noticed some tightening in my throat when walking and discomfort in my left arm for a couple of days. I did not get any chest pain until a few hours before I decided to go to the hospital and even then it was just a slight burn. At my age, I honestly didn't think I was having a heart attack, but I read the signs and I have a family history of it, so I decided to go to the ER. I even drove myself about an hour to get there. The doctors were ready to send me home with a heartburn diagnosis until the troponin came back and it was indeed a heart attack. They kept me there for two days until they did the angiogram and placed a stent.

Since then, I was in and out of the hospital because I got worried anytime I felt arm pain and stuff. Although, it felt similar to what I felt initially, I eventually chalked it up to just being over-worried and over analyzing the pains. I'm obviously bruising very easily with the blood thinners (effient) I am on, and I concluded that the bruising from that was causing my pain. I have no idea how accurate this is, but it gave me a little (not much) comfort. My cardiologist everytime said he didn't believe what was happening was cardiac, even when I said it felt very similar to my initial heart attack experience.

So about a month and a half to two months ago, I started feeling my throat getting tight again at random times. I can't really say it was exactly like the heart attack experience, because that was a definitive when I start exerting myself that the throat would tighten and then ease up after I relax a bit. This is a little different, it seems to definitely be started by activity, but not really exertion, for instance, I wake up in the morning and don't have it, but I can walk to the bathroom and it starts up, but it will also just remain for sometimes an hour or more. I walk every evening, and sometimes it will be there and go away mid walk, which doesn't really seem typical. It also doesn't really get more intense as more exertion happens it tends to stay at the same intensity. I've seen ENTs and they've checked my throat with both a CT scan and a scope and don't seem to see anything that concerns them from a throat perspective. I also have had my lymph nodes swollen since I've had the heart attack for an unknown reason. My cardiologist kept saying he didn't believe it was cardiac initially.

Three weeks ago it got really bad, and I also had a headache so I decided to go to the hospital, they decided to do another angiogram and I did have another stent placed for another blockage. When looking at my initial medical record, it seems they were well aware that this blockage was there. I am not sure why it wasn't stented the first time in. As scary and traumatic as this all has been I was happy to think I may have some relief now. The same day I went home from the hospital I began experiencing the throat tightness again. I went to see my cardiologist a few days later expecting him to again say he doesn't believe this is cardiac related as he always does, however this time he seemed to be more concerned or at least open to the idea that something is wrong, he is treating it like angina and gave me ranolazine which has been ineffective so far.

I don't know what to do. No one has any answers for me. I've been suffering every single day. I can't focus on anything with these symptoms still happening. My cardiologist just keeps telling me he doesn't believe things are cardiac until I am in the hospital getting stented again and even that hasn't eased my issue. In addition to the throat tightness I often have arm pains as mentioned, and little chest pains and burns. I have attributed this the same as the arm pain as caused by bruising, since I can often find sore to the touch spots on my chest when I feel the pains. Again, I don't know if this is the right way to conclude this, but since my cardiologist doesn't believe it is cardiac and the 6 times I've been to the hospital have been inconclusive, I don't know what else to do. Now the throat tightness, I can't find some kind of reasoning for that. Even the ENTs don't have an answer. So essentially, I go through every single day wondering If i am having another heart attack, EVERY SINGLE DAY.

How many times am I going to spend a weekend in the hospital? I already miss a ton of days of work to go to the cardiologist, ENT, PCP, endocrinologist (I am diabetic), I am also currently having scans done for odd lumps on my breast area (just what I need right now). It's difficult to even focus on anything when I am at work because I always feel as though I should be in the hospital, since I have these symptoms EVERY DAY. I can't hold a conversation with anyone, because I am always thinking about these symptoms. My life has just been suffering. I'm trying so hard to live, but I can't get an answer, I can't get some peace of mind. I can't get anything. I just don't know what to do or what to make of these issues.",AskDocs,t3_dkds2c

So, whole of Saturday, my upper right tooth has been acting up - so I went to see a dentist who was saying I'd require a root canal to fix it, and gave me some pain killers to deal with it. The whole of Saturday I was just in agony, especially since I have to wait till tomorrow to check when the earliest appointment I can get for my root canal at the national dental centre.

I just graduated in July, and that was a church I was in for 2.5 years, so it feels like so much has changed - especially having started work since.

In the beginning of 2016, probably february, I had been dealing with a lot of hormonal issues and went to my doctor who diagnosed me with PCOS which was fine.. Okay perhaps not fine but at least I knew what it was and what I could do for it. He put me on Tri-cyclen and Accutane (The acne from my messed up hormones was starting to leave scars.) Around June I hadn't really noticed a change and went back, did new blood work and all that jazz, and my doctor put me on Spironolactone to try to help reduce the unfortunate ladybeard with which I had been plagued. I started taking it with no noticable problems to begin with but started noticing something weird, about mid-July. I was itchier than usual and any kind of skin irritation would welt up and become unbelievably itchy, and I mean like any kind of skin irritation, even just a small LIGHT scratch on my hand would welt up. My best example of it is from that July, I was at a family gathering and I had to take my shoes and socks off because the impression of my socks against the tops of my feet had caused the entire tops of both of my feet to welt up and were extremely itchy. I took the Spironolactone for a couple months after that, but eventually stopped because I noticed I hadn't had the itching or the welts until I started it. The welts have mostly stopped, but the itchiness has persisted and is near constant. I don't know if theres a connection to the Spironolactone, I just know that the itchiness started around the time I started taking it. I also thought it could be the accutane, since I know the higher dose of accutane I was on really dries you out but I was off of accutane for a good while with no improvement. I thought perhaps HS would be the cause but the only ""itchiness"" problems I see for that are only to do with the affected area, which I do experience... On top of the other itchiness.

"[30F] Dupuytrens diagnosis but I’m confused over it30 
Female 
5’5”
White
Not a drinker
Not a smoker
No drug use

I noticed a tiny lump in the palm of my left hand just under a year ago. About 3 months later I went to my primary care Dr. for something unrelated so I brought it up. He said it was either dupuytrens or a cyst and if it wasn’t causing pain it’s no big deal. I was happy with that since it’s never been painful. It can get sore if I’m doing things like tying a bunch of ribbons or typing for hours but it doesn’t really hurt. I do have a high tolerance for pain though. 

Fast forward 6 months later and my last two fingers are curved and the bump is larger. I asked my doctor about it again recently and he said it now looked like classic dupuytrens and to let him know if it starts to hurt and he can send me to a physical therapist. 

It’s not painful so I declined. I honestly don’t have the time for weekly physical therapy appointments as it is right now so I’m hoping it doesn’t become painful later on. 

I did some google image searches (bad idea lol) and now I’m confused. Everything I see on dupuytrens mostly shows straight fingers but bent towards the palm. I got this at 29 as a female, I feel like it came on fast and I feel like my last two fingers move away from my palm rather than towards it. I’m just curious if it looks like dupuytrens to anyone else or if it could be something different? To me the bump does very much resemble dupuytrens but my curved fingers are what’s throwing me off. 

Something worth noting (might be completely irrelevant) is a few months before I noticed the bump in my palm I was leash training my strong and reactive rescue dog at the time so I would often wrap the leash around my palm several times for better control when he pulled. I can’t recall ever injuring my hand though. I also had a ganglion cyst removed on my wrist of that hand 12 years ago which is probably irrelevant too. No issues, it never came back.  

Please note: In the top left photo my middle finger is bent only to show the bump in my palm better. If I move my middle finger the bump in my palm moves up and down with it almost like it’s attached to that tendon or something (no clue if it actually is). My middle finger seems normal though. It’s only the last two fingers that are curving.

This will likely be lengthy but I would be beyond grateful if someone can help me in any way. 
Tldr: I haven't eaten in a week and feel nauseous af, help! 

I am a 20 yo female, caucasian and I live in Europe. I have a history of feeling nauseous quite often, and apparently polycystic ovaries. I also have some mental issues for sure, but I have only just gotten a psychological test done and won't be seeing a psychiatrist until next month. My issues have mostly to do with anxiety, depression, and poor emotion control. I also smoke weed, but haven't done so since my troubles started last week.

Now on to the issue.

I haven't eaten a proper meal since last Tuesday. On Wednesday I woke up early for college, had some coffee, and left the house. I realized I don't feel well on my commute but since I have a history of feeling sick, and I have been slightly nauseous daily since college started, I didn't pay much attention to it. I started worrying when I literally couldn't swallow a bite of a pastry I bought that I usually quite like. I ended up leaving college early that day and going home, hoping it passes.
It didn't.

In the following days I visited my doctor, who upon reading my psych evaluation said it was in my head bc I'm stressed and to go home, relax, and eat.
The following day I also went to my gynecologist. She did a vaginal ultrasound and yet again sent me on my way, saying it's polycystic ovaries.
Now, my last period was 3rd-10th October and I had sex with my bf on the 2nd and the 10th. Of course, I'm horrified of being pregnant because I can't think of anything else that would cause me to feel this way for this long.

Other than the nausea, my hands and feet are sweaty and cold but that could just be from not eating. My breasts feel slightly larger than usual but they don't hurt at all. And I had pains in my ovaries last night that somewhat persist into today. I also have some back pain. 

Today, I've been trying to eat 1 mashed banana and 1 mashed apple mixed together for 5 hours now. I feel full after every bite, and have diarrhea after approx every 5 bites. I'm also very weak. 

I did blood tests 2 or so months ago and they came back perfectly healthy, only my red cell count was slightly elevated.
My mother thinks I should just force myself to eat, but when I try it feels like I'm already full and if I keep forcing myself I just feel more nauseous. I have been drinking ginger and chamomile tea.

He has problem moving and extending his right arm and leg for two months, especially the arm, he can't extend it fully, he regain it now. That happened about 3 years I think, so it was 2 years after the heart angioplasty.

What I'm concerned about is, was the aspirin necessary? I read that it may cause bleeding in the brain and I though that what may have happened to him, or was it the emotional stress of that incident?

Thank you, and sorry for this long, and probably not useful for a clear diagnosis, but I'm worried and I hope you understand.",AskDocs,t3_dkhqmn

I haven’t had my period for 3 months, my vagina is hurting really bad right now (seems like the bones in my vagina are aching and the entry of my vagina is burning) I’ve been spotting the past few days. I’ve always had irregular periods since I can remember. One month yes the next month no. But never have I ever missed my period 3 consecutive months. This is becoming concerning and I just wish I could have someone look at my vagina and tell me what’s wrong with me lol a little of my health history and primarily where I believe this could be coming from are:

I’ve gained about 45lbs within 3 years. I’m at my biggest point and have doubled my pants size literally. &amp; just within the past year and a half was 30 lbs I have gained. hopefully this is the issue so I could just start working out and eating healthier. Im really hoping it’s something I can fix.

Other reasons could fall upon my sex health.  I have herpes 1 down there and 3 years ago I was diagnosed with HPV. Because I had insurance back then the doctor was keeping an eye on it. They ran tests and said it was not cancerous but it is getting worse slowly by slowly so that was something to be worried about and keep an eye on. I’d say it could be gone by now but who knows. A year and half ago I had a really bad break out on it.

"I don't know what's wrong with meThis will likely be lengthy but I would be beyond grateful if someone can help me in any way. 
Tldr: I haven't eaten in a week and feel nauseous af, help! 

I am a 20 yo female. I have a history of feeling nauseous quite often, and apparently polycystic ovaries. I also have some mental issues for sure, but I have only just gotten a psychological test done and won't be seeing a psychiatrist until next month. My issues have mostly to do with anxiety, depression, and poor emotion control.

Now on to the issue.

I haven't eaten a proper meal since last Tuesday. On Wednesday I woke up early for college, had some coffee, and left the house. I realized I don't feel well on my commute but since I have a history of feeling sick, and I have been slightly nauseous daily since college started, I didn't pay much attention to it. I started worrying when I literally couldn't swallow a bite of a pastry I bought that I usually quite like. I ended up leaving college early that day and going home, hoping it passes.
It didn't.
In the following days I visited my doctor, who upon reading my psych evaluation said it was in my head bc I'm stressed and to go home, relax, and eat.
The following day I also went to my gynecologist. She did a vaginal ultrasound and yet again sent me on my way, saying it's polycystic ovaries.
Now, my last period was 3rd-10th October and I had sex with my bf on the 2nd and the 10th. Of course, I'm horrified of being pregnant because I can't think of anything else that would cause me to feel this way for this long.
Other than the nausea, my hands and feet are sweaty and cold but that could just be from not eating. My breasts feel slightly larger than usual but they don't hurt at all. And I had pains in my ovaries last night. 
I did blood tests 2 or so months ago and they came back perfectly healthy, only my red cell count was slightly elevated.
My mother thinks I should just force myself to eat, but when I try it feels like I'm already full and if I keep forcing myself I just feel more nauseous. I have been drinking ginger and chamomile tea.

I will go to a hospital soon if nothing changes, but I'd really appreciate it if someone gave me their opinion on the situation as I am freaking out.",AskDocs,t3_dkgy20

"Coffee Enemas: A Deceit or Miracle for Cancer Patients? (Lymphoma? Male, 64 Years Old, 126 lbs)My father has not been diagnosed with anything yet, but his symptoms are pointing to lymphoma. His biopsy will be performed next week. Symptoms: Enlarged lymph nodes, fatigue, shortness of breath, weakness in legs, loss of appetite, and SIGNIFICANT weight loss. He maintained a weight of 145 lbs for years, but now he is 126 lbs and it has been concerning my mom, sister, and I.  This happened in a span of a year.

He is retired and mainly lives a sedentary lifestyle and eats twice a day. Obviously, this is not okay. We try to encourage him to eat more and be more active, but he has no ambition to eat and exercise due to his symptoms.  Because of his age and disinterest to change his lifestyle, my sister and I stepping up to the plate as his main caregivers now. We cook heavy meals for him high in protein and moderate carbohydrates from veggies for him to eat 3 times a day. Everyday, we make him 32 oz of homemade organic vegetable and fruit juice with our juicer. He now does light exercise at the gym 2-3 a week.

My main focus is for him to eat healthy and get enough calories a day for him to gain weight and strength. However, my sister is more concerned with finding alternative treatments to detoxify his body and prevent the what-we-believe-to-be-cancer from worsening. She puts an emphasis on juicing, dry brushing, and coffee enemas, which comes from The Gerson Therapy, an alternative medicine approach. I personally do not believe in the Gerson Therapy. There is no evidence that proves the effectiveness of coffee enemas, but she believes in it so much and states how the medical field purposely doesn't disclose these benefits to profit from more expensive treatments such as chemotherapy, ect. In a nutshell, my sister is a hippie. I am having a hard time with her. I don't want to make any decisions that can potentially harm my father, but she thinks the Gerson Therapy is the best approach. I just find it frustrating  especially because I am 25 and she is 36 and I wish she wasn't easily swayed by what the Internet says. It's an illogical approach, but again I could be wrong.......?

"I [24m] took a hard blow to the temple on Wednesday night, and it still hurts quite bad on Sunday. Is it serious?To kick it off I'm in the UK, so I do have the NHS, but I'm always hesitant to go to the Dr for something unless I know it's definitely quite bad in fear of bothering the already stretched staff. 

I work as a nightlife photographer, so 3-4 nights a week I'm out in clubs taking photographs. On Wednesday night I took an elbow to the temple quite hard. I remained conscious, just felt a bit dazed for a few seconds, but carried on. It hurt a lot, but I drank water, finished my night ajd went home. 

The next day it hurt quite bad, no Biggie. Popped some ibuprofen and went about my day. Thursday night was fine, and I had no discomfort. Friday night it started to hurt again a little when out shooting, but nothing massive. 

The kicker was Saturday morning. I woke up in the early hours in an immense amount of pain on my temple. It felt like my head was going to explode. But I'm not one to bother medical staff for something that might not be serious when they have more important injuries, so I just popped some more ibuprofen and life was bliss. 

Saturday night I was in agony while shooting and struggled to concentrate. I got home, took even more tablets and went to sleep. Woke up 2 hours later in a horrendous amount of pain, and here we are now. I'm exhausted from not having slept for 2 nights, and I'm set to be out shooting again tonight. 

If I were to describe the pain, it feels like a mix of 2 things. First, it's like someone is tattooing my temple. Second, it's like my head is a giant pimple, and I just have to pop it to release all the pressure in my head. I'm a healthy 24 year old male, approx 5 foot 9, and 70kg.

"Tried to pull out the ‘string’ hanging out of incision, instantly regretted it22F - 175cm 75kg

Two days ago I had my implanon (contraceptive rod) taken out of my arm. It was supposed to be taken out after three years but life got in the way and I kept forgetting so it ended up being in my arm for longer. Getting it out proved difficult for the doctor, he made a small incision in the spot it was originally inserted as you could very obviously feel and see it under the skin if you pressed on it and it was still in its original spot. After making the cut he found it very difficult to find, I guess tissue or whatever had grown over it and that why it seemed to be “hiding” so it took him a while and a fair amount of tugging and manipulating my arm to get a hold on the end of the implant. After that it was over super quickly, I didn’t feel any pain during the whole thing and found the whole removal to go pretty smoothly. 

After that a nurse came and put a steri-strip over the incision, then a plaster over that and then a pressure bandage to help with bruising. The bandage was meant to stay on for 24hrs, the plaster for 3 days and the steri-strip until it fell off. The bandage was put on way too tight and felt like it was cutting circulation to my arm so I loosened it after 30-60 minutes and then eventually removed it all together, the plaster came off in the shower the next morning (yesterday) so I put a bandaid over the strip because it was stained with blood and I had to go to work. Today the bandaid and the strip both came off and there was a little white string looking thing hanging out of the incision, there were definitely no stitched used so I assumed it was a fibre or something from the plaster that had somehow managed to work it’s way into the cut? Even though it was covered by a steri strip? After a few hours it was still there so I tried pulling it out with tweezers, it seemed to be really stuck in the incision and did not want to budge even after I pulled a little harder. I have an extremely strong stomach and am never bothered with things like that but after trying to pull on the ‘string’ I suddenly got extremely hot which just kept getting worse and I felt faint and weak and nauseous almost. It started bleeding so I put a tissue over it while I sat for a bit and had some water and food thinking that dehydration or something may have been the cause of me feeling unwell. After a few minutes and feeling a little bit better I went to show someone else and get their opinion and the tissue had stuck to the string. I didn’t try and pull much, just tried to move it to the side to get a better look and as soon as it started to move the ‘string’ with it I instantly started to feel horribly ill again and had to stop.

My boyfriend &amp; I both got tested for STDs​ &amp; STI's but everything came back negative. He is completely asymptomatic, but I have been having recurrent UTI's (E.coli) every month or so. I started taking a dose of Bactrim after sex about a month ago &amp; have since stopped getting UTI's, but I'm still having a whole slew of other symptoms.

**These include:**

* Brown bleeding during sex; this happens every time &amp; there is no spotting afterward but it's definitely blood. It's not related to my period (which is either very light or nonexistent) &amp; none of the doctors I've seen can tell me what's causing it which is extremely frustrating.
* My periods are either very light or nonexistent, I think this is from my IUD
* A feeling of air or air bubbles being trapped in my vagina or urethra after I pee. This doesn't hurt but it's very distracting and unpleasant
* Sharp stabbing pain in vagina randomly, doesn't follow any pattern as far as I can tell
* White discharge under the ​clitoral hood that comes &amp; goes

"Help! No diagnosis. Tired of tests. Want to fully live my life.**TLDR at the end with bullet points, medical records and findings.**

22F. 135lbs. 5'7""/5'8"". Caucasian. Canadian.

Before the first bit gets you, please read the TLDR bottom medical stuff. I really need some guidance and ideas of what to look into or suggest to doctors. I've done a barium swallow, ECG, ultrasounds, an MRI, tons of blood tests, seen a rheumatologist, consistently see a nephrologist, consistently see a psychiatrist. Notes below of reports from some of these tests.

Can give blood work results if you ask for anything specific, because it's most likely been checked. Can also provide images of the bladder and things from my MRI and ultrasounds.

I just want to live life fully.

A bit of an intro: So. Both mental and physical. Since around late 2015 I was hit with a depressive episode which is where everything starts. Had depression before this, but this was a benchmark for shit *really* affecting my life. Earlier in the year experienced a hypomanic episode. First psychiatric medication Escitalopram started around 2014ish. Been on psychiatric medication since. I still haven't fully 'recovered'

Along that time everything hit. Depressive episode which was more of a lack of everything. Lack of motivation, energy, liveliness, would just lay in bed, sleep all day, socially isolated myself, fell out of touch with all my friends, blah blah.

After I stopped really feeling depressed, the other symptoms still lingered. No motivation, no energy, always exhausted to the point where my face and eyes and body would ache all over, feeling like it was skin level almost? I would be so tired I would need to take 3 hour naps every single day, sleeping a total of 12 or 13 hours every day, so definitely oversleeping.

The fatigue was a pain in the ass. It basically disabled me. Couldn't really do things, function normally, it hurt, I was fighting sleep a lot. It sucked. It wasn't 24/7, and even when I wasn't feeling pain or extreme fatigue I still had no motivation or drive to do anything. I still deal with having aversions to things, a mental block that has no thought just no no no I can't do this. Avoidance. Blah blah. It fucking sucks. I wanna go on walks. I want to be social and have a social life and go outside regularly, not inside 24/7. I want friends again. I want to want to do things. Not have this mental block overwhelming me with not wanting to do things, and having the overwhelming want of what I want to do is the act of staying inside doing bare minimum. Things that take little to no mental energy or focus or grounding.

I feel like I've been floating through life, a blur, since 2015.

Gone through a bunch of therapy and psychiatric meds. Early on I had extreme nausea issues especially after eating. Had a barium swallow, blood tests, ECG, ultrasounds, MRI, and I know I had others I just can't remember right now it all blurs together.

I also recently remembered that when I was in the 6th grade, I flipped over the handlebars of my bike, head first onto the sidewalk (protected by my helmet, thankfully) messed up my knees real bad, couldnt walk or bend my knees for quite some time. Some reason I never saw a doctor about it.

"Boils on bodyHello, I'm 23 F, 5'3, 152 pounds, Indian-Canadian. I'm concerned about some boils appearing on my body, that I've noticed in the last 3 weeks. I currently take cranberry pills to prevent UTIs that I get rather frequently. I don't smoke or do any drugs, but I drink occasionally. 

The boils are appearing only one or two at a time - not all together. They resemble chicken pox, but I've already contracted this when I was younger. These boils also don't leave a scab, like they would in chicken pox.

They first appeared on my upper-inner thighs, then inside my ear, then my behind, and now my leg.

My partner was diagnosed with shingles/herpes around 7 months ago, but given that my boils are appearing all over my body, I don't think that's the case for me?

It's been about 3 weeks since I started noticing the boils, and haven't had any significant accompanying fever or illness.

"[28M]Painful urination - a few questions (warning: graphic)So about a week and a half after getting oral sex from an escort without protection I started to experience a burning sensation when I pee. I feel it inside the urethra just below the glans and if I apply a little pressure, it feels sore. As I pee continually for a longer time though, the pain subsides. I went to a clinic and submitted a urine sample. The doctor prescribed a one-time dose of 1000 mg of azithromycin and said to call in a few days regarding the test results. The dipstick urinalysis however, came out negative for blood/bacteria. I have a couple of questions:

1. What are the chances this is genital herpes? Could it manifest as painful urination? I read that dysuria may be a symptom of genital herpes but I do not see any sores and the pain seems to be inside the urethra not close to the opening.

2. How common are UTIs in males? The doctor presumes it is an STI but I don't see any discharge although I get a little urine leakage when I pee (as in a little extra urine may come out when it seems like I'm done). Internet resources all seem to have lots of info about UTIs in women but make it seem as though they are exceedingly rare in men. If it makes any difference, the girl I had sex with used a LOT of saliva (basically slobbered all over my dick). 

3. Is it safe to drink a couple of beers about 8 hours after dosing azithromycin? The information seems to be conflicting on this. Some sources say you can drink on it and others say it will cause liver damage. NHS (UK) website says you can drink alcohol on zithromax while Health Canada just says ""avoid alcohol on antibiotics"". I'm going out for dinner with a few colleagues so I am expecting to have a couple of drinks (NO hard liquor). 

4. This might sound a little weird but my dog has been having recurring urinary tract infections for about a year now that he has repeatedly been treated with antibiotics for. Is it possible that I could have gotten something from touching him/something something stained in his piss and not washing my hands and then touching my junk?

Starting to get off and on chest pains. Uncomfortable and feels like it’s a crushing pain/sharp. Breathing is a little more difficult but I can still take full breaths, but I have to focus on it more. It’s becoming more common and has been for the past 2 weeks. Last for a few hours generally but it’s been all day today. My heart rate is still normal, 68 BPM just about an hour ago. Coughing too but my throat has been starting to get ticklish so maybe that’s a separate issue

Thursday I was in class and randomly started feeling dizzy for a few minutes and heart was kind of fast. Mentally I felt disassociated/ kind of panicky. Kind of like a fear of death but I reassured myself and took deep breaths and after a few mins it went away.  Also the mental dissociation is starting to happen more often. Like 10 mins today and a few mins yesterday. 

The best way to describe the mental dissociation (what I call it because Idk of a better term) is I just don’t feel like I’m in my body. Very zoned out and feel like I’m in a 3rd view. Along with slight panic feeling. Idk if that makes sense. 


It may be because of mid terms, lack of sleep, and other financial problems the past few weeks. Hopefully it is. I stopped juuling around 5 weeks ago. 

Pretty good medical history. Had seizures as a toddler and diagnosed with ADD but other than that pretty normal.


I should also add that Ive been take 30-60mg of adderall almost daily for a few weeks at a time for the last 6 months. I take breaks and because of this my body doesn’t like to sleep at night so I’ve been taking Benadryl (50-100 mg) and melatonin quite a bit at night and to cut the groggy feeling I take adderall.

I've been diagnosed with dysthymia and I've tried countless different antidepressants of all kinds. Some didn't work at all while most of them can get rid of some symptoms of my depression, but I never feel 100% ""normal"". Since this disease is chronic I'm depressed 24/7, some days more, some days less, but never good enough. I am currently on mirtazapine 30mg and escitalopram 15mg.

That was until last year when I started abusing DMH (dimenhydrinate). That's when my life changed. I am 31 years old and I felt like I was suddenly awaken, as if I was dreaming or in a deep fog and then by abusing this drug the veil or curse has been lifted from me and now I finally feel alive after over 20 long painful years living with this condition.

Of course I know it's stupid, I've read countless articles about DMH and it's slowly poisoning my brain. But it works, so much so I have now become addicted to it. I can't really function without it. So I think I'm going to keep taking it until I can find something that really works without doing any more harm. I tend to build a tolerance to it and after about 2 weeks of taking it every single day (usually anywhere from 200mg to 500mg) I have to take a break (usually a week) to be able to get the same effects again. Also after a while I start getting mildly psychotic. That's why I don't really want to abuse DMH, but for me being depressed is much much worse.

I’m randomly swearing, clapping, hitting myself, and clenching for no reason and involuntarily. This started in my senior year of high school three years ago. At first it was small random noises which I could hide reasonably well. That’s how it stayed for 2 1/2 years. Until January of this year when it just got way out of control and to a point where I can’t stop it. I don’t swear in normal conversation thanks to a very strict upbringing but I’ve started randomly blurting the f word, clapping involuntarily, and shouting “I hate you” at the top of my lungs to nobody in particular, and slapping myself at full force. At this point I’m also clawing myself in my sleep and leaving marks and scratches in the morning. I’m not sure if this is related to the tics but the only thing that helps is when I sleep in mittens. I usually can hide the smaller tics easily, but I can’t hide this anymore and I can’t even tell when an episode is coming. I can’t tell something’s wrong till I’m actively doing something my brain did tell my limbs to do. I’ve stopped driving because I’ll randomly clap while operating a vehicle.

Mondays and Wednesdays were my shorter, faster runs; I'd go for about 2 miles at about 11:45 min/mi., and Saturdays were my longer, slower runs; I'd go around 5 miles at about 12:30 min/mi.  I stretch before and after each run. 

About a month ago I started having pain on the top of my foot, right over the 3rd metatarsal. I'm also a ""toe cracker"", and it really hurt to pull the third toe down to crack it. It also hurt to walk on it in flat shoes. I had the sports therapist at college look at it, and he couldn't seem to find out the problem, so I went to a podiatrist. He sent me to get an x-ray to see if there were any fractures, but there were none. He thinks it's just tendonitis. 

I looked up tendonitis in the metatarsals, and the most common seems to be extender tendonitis. But I noticed that typically people with that condition have pain when stretching their toes up, not down. My toe does not hurt to stretch it upwards or even to walk in heels. I also can't seem to find anything about pain when bending/pulling toes down in a Google search other than for the big toe. 

My foot has seemed to be healing. However, when I pull the third toe downward as if to crack it, I still feel pain in the metatarsal region. When I put pressure on that region, it does hurt, but nowhere else. I took 3 weeks off of running since it hurt so much, but I've been slowly getting back into running about once a week. So far, so good, but I don't want to overdo it. Other runner friends of mine have recommended icing my foot several times a day and using compression. I've been following their suggestions. 

What kind of tendonitis in the metatarsal region/ top of foot seems to cause pain when pulling/bending toes downward, not upward? How should I treat it?",AskDocs,t3_dkcr48
"Age, Gender: 20F Height: 5’4” Weight: 160 pounds. Possible spider biteMy friend woke up this morning around 7am eastern with a small hive on the joint where her thumb connects to her hand. 

She said it itched when she woke up, it was swollen around just where the hive was on the thumb. She had some uncomfortable feelings in her arm but other than that no pain or fever. 
Fast forward about 13 hours later and it’s still there and to explain the feeling, it feels like she got a shot in her arm. She showered and noticed two bite marks about half a millimeter apart from each other, that look like a black widow bite according to google. (I understand google isn’t the best place to be for medically related things) There’s no pain in her arm, just obvious swelling from the bite down to her wrist. The bite is warm to the touch.

No medications (just Flonase for seasonal allergies). Bloodwork from his annual physical was great...except maybe his TSH was on the low end at .61 mIU/L

My boyfriend and I have been together 3y.  A year ago, I noticed he had a lump 3-4 inches wide on the left side occipital bone. He wasn’t aware of it and denied any injury to the area.  It’s not super firm, no pitting, blanching, itching, heat, or tenderness. A quick glance and feel suggests lipoma to me (I’m not a doctor, I’ve owned a large horse boarding/training facility for 12 years. Mysterious bumps, fungal/bacterial/parasitic infections, various wounds and lamenesses etc. is an everyday thing for me). However, the rash over the lump seems odd. 

He was experiencing some cold/allergy like symptoms at the time we discovered the lump, so he went to the dr without much fuss.  The doc thought the lump was interesting but not too concerned and he was given antibiotics. I took pictures of the lump the day I found it, and a month later and it didn’t seem to be changing, so we let it be.

A few weeks ago, I happened to notice it’s changed and the rash is still there. I want him to go get it checked out but he doesn’t have great insurance.  Any likely possibilities? Think it’s okay to wait it out? What’s the cheapest route to get answers?  If it were a horse, we’d ultrasound it and/or do a needle aspiration biopsy, but I know human healthcare has more BS to wade through.  Should he see a dermatologist? General surgeon?

If any of you don't have time to read all of it, and just want to answer some questions, they're at the bottom, in the part where I talk about my symptoms. But if you can read all of it to get a good idea of what's going on, that'd be fantastic. Thanks either way.*

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**First of all, some basic info about me:**

* I'm \[26M\]
* Caucasian (I'm from Sweden)
* I'm a bit uncertain about my height, but I think I'm somewhere between 170cm and 180cm.
* Weight is 54 kilograms
* I have no existing medical issues that I know of, and therefore am not taking any kind of medication for anything.
* I do however have teeth problems, and have had a root canal done in my lower left corner. It fell out and my economy isn't really great right now, and since dentists don't count under free healthcare in my country, I haven't been back to fix it because it's very expensive. I don't know if this is relevant, but I'll mention it anyway.
* I don't drink, smoke, or use any other kind of drug.

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**With that out of the way, let me explain my history with this:**

So, this all started in the beginning of this year, after I had been at a gig with my band, and I ended up catching a severe cold that put me out of commission for over a week. There was a period where I could barely talk. During this time, I started having issues with my right ear. It felt as if something was clogging up the ear canal. I go to my local health clinic and they say that I have a lot of earwax in my ear. They flush it, and I leave, feeling a bit better, but the next day, I notice the feeling is still there.

Over the course of 2 months, I come back a couple of more times to get my ears cleaned, as well as to verify that it's not an ear infection, which according to the nurses I went to, it wasn't. In May, I got a recommendation from the nurse to try using an anti-inflammatory nose spray named [Nasonex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mometasone), or Mometasone, according to Wikipedia. I used it for about a month's time, and without any results, I stopped. In July, I went back to the clinic, where I got to do a hearing test, as I noticed my hearing had gotten worse, but according to the test, I got very high results, which surprised me. I'll get to this in the part where I talk about my symptoms.

Anyway, this is where I get a referral to the ENT-clinic to meet with a specialist, rather than just the district nurse. Wait times are usually pretty long, so I got an appointment about 2 and a half months later, on October 13th, a week ago now.

I get to this appointment, and they run another hearing test, which is a bit more advanced than the previous one, due to them having isolated rooms and the ability to measure much quieter sounds. Again, to my surprise, this test comes out with good results.

I then meet with the specialist doctor, and this is when I'm unsure. I don't know about this doctor, but I don't know anything, so I obviously can't tell if his conduct was good or not. I may get a second opinion, maybe even from a different hospital? I don't know if that's recommended, though..

Either way, I tell him about my symptoms (listed below), he feels on my throat, temples, and has me open and close my mouth.. You know, typical examination stuff. He also puts a camera into my nose, sprays some type of liquid into it, and also takes a look down my throat. In the end he says that he can't find anything wrong with me. He seemed to be convinced that I'm making things up, or that it's all in my imagination. He said to go home, stop thinking about it (which is hard since I notice it at all times), and come back if it gets worse, which seems ridiculous to me, because if it gets worse, it may be too late.

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**A TL;DR for the history bit**

January - Started feeling clogged in right ear, went to district nurse. Went back a few more times. It's not an ear infection.

May - Got recommendation for Nasonex, an anti-inflammatory nose spray. Used for a month, didn't work.

July - Situation worsened, went back to district nurse, did hear test, good score. Got referral to specialist.

October - Situation worsened again, a day before I went to specialist. Did more advanced hear test, they said nothing's wrong. In my experience, this isn't accurate.

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

**See, I'm scared to death of the possibility of becoming deaf**, or ending up with some kind of irreparable hearing damage. I'm worried that's what I already have. I'm a musician, and so music is extremely important to me, but for the past few months, and especially the last week when I noticed another decline, music that I've listened to a lot before doesn't sound the same anymore, so I can't really enjoy it like I used to. I know for a fact that something's different, which makes me worried for several reasons when my doctor says that there isn't anything wrong.

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

Anyway, before I babble on too much, **here is a list of the symptoms I'm having**:

* Lowered hearing. After the most recent decline, about a week ago, I can't make out what people are talking about in the room next to me. I can barely hear if somebody is shouting for me. Music doesn't sound like it used to, whether I listen to it with headphones, or live. Certain instruments are getting drowned out by the others. It's hard to make out what people in the front seat of a car is saying if I'm sitting in the back, stuff like that. I've noticed a bigger difference in dynamics than before. If someone looks away, it's suddenly way harder to hear what they're saying. I don't remember that being an issue before, nor any of the other examples I just gave.
* In general, it seems my distance-hearing is a good bit worse than it used to be.
* I sometimes feel a twinge (or sting, not sure which would be more accurate here) in both ears, as well as itching, accompanied with occasional tinnitus that lasts anywhere from 10 seconds to a few minutes, and varies from a really high-pitched sharp tone, to more of a lower-pitched ringing.
* I also sometimes have sharp pains in my temples.
* I sometimes feel a sense of popping in my ear, usually when yawning. It's sort of similar to the feeling you get when you have water in your ear, but just for a split second. Don't know if that's relevant at all, but..
* When I do things such as yawning or swallowing, there's a crackling sound in both ears. The doctor said this is just due to muscles contracting or something like that, which seems reasonable.
* I often feel stiff around my neck and jaw, and muscle stiffness and soreness in general is pretty common. I'm not very physically active so that might explain that, but that doesn't explain the neck and jaw stiffness.
* In my experience, I have very dry ears. There's dry skin peeling off of them (or maybe dry earwax, hard to tell). My doctor said that my ear canal isn't dry, but the ear..shell (I don't know what it's called in English, but outside the actual hole) is dry. He offered no further explanation, and I didn't ask, since it seemed to him like it wasn't a big deal.
* I have very thick and slimy phlegm. Sometimes, it gets stuck in my throat, and it's really difficult to get out, making me gag on it, which is very uncomfortable. The doctor said this is normal, and I found that weird since it hasn't been a problem before. Thoughts on this?
* I've had a near constant cold for 8+ months now.
* When I wear headphones that aren't the type that reach over and around, cupping your ear, my ears hurt. I work at a call center, and it's getting to the point where I can't wear the headsets we use because it hurts after a while, and it gives me anxiety.
* My voice has gotten pretty weak. I can still talk, but my throat is very rough sometimes, more so than usual.
* It might be worth noting that I woke up this morning, and my right ear felt a lot clearer than before. It felt alright. I was so happy about it, but about 5 minutes later, it went back to how it normally is.

~~---------------------------------------------------------------------~~

That's all I have to say. I'm really sorry that this post ended up being so long, but I didn't want to omit anything, and this is stuff that has been ongoing for a year, so there was a lot to say. It's getting to the point where this is affecting my mental health as well, with anxiety and whatnot, so I'll honestly take any advice I can get. Obviously, they sent me home from the ENT-clinic without really doing much, and if I want to go back, that's another 3 months of waiting. I have no idea how to proceed from here. If anyone can answer my questions, maybe put my mind at ease on some of these things, or give me any advice in general, I really, really would appreciate it.

I woke up with my entire jaw swollen and throbbing so I went to the ER. It’s been hurting for a month but we just don’t have the couple thousand the dentist needs so I haven’t got it fixed. Yesterday it got unbearable to the point I woke up in the middle of the night and ended up taking ibuprofen despite knowing I can’t while pregnant. Once I could think straight, I started googling what medicines are safe and found Clindamycin and hydrocodone are safe and I think we actually have both from my husbands dental implant surgery last year. Look up doses, etc., take some and by no means does it take all the pain away but it’s bearable. Mid-morning I start having cramps! Not insane cramps but painful enough that I started to worry it’s from the ibuprofen and we head to the ER. 

Tell the ER doctor everything, he has an ultra sound done, baby is ok, looks at my tooth, draws blood and we wait for them to test. He comes back saying I have a bad infection and need to see a dentist ASAP. We can’t really afford it so he does kindly refer me to a low cost clinic but stresses I must be persistent because they’re usually booked weeks to months out and my infection is no joke. Prescribes Clindamycin, 4-150 mg pills, 3 times a day for 7 days. I ask what to do for pain and he says just try to control it with what I have and ask the dentist when I get in.
I go to pick up my prescription and happen to know the pharmacist pretty well, she asks about the infection and is super surprised he didn’t write for pain medication. When I explained more of what happened and how I took ibuprofen she was even more angry and expressed several areas of concern. The amount of antibiotic indicates the infection is very severe, ibuprofen is a HUGE no no right now, he didn’t advise me to continue taking someone else’s antibiotic but rightfully wrote me my own prescription for the same medicine, he didn’t discuss pain control and in a round about way, suggested continuing to take someone else’s pain medication or perhaps ibuprofen was ok to take...ultimately this should have been addressed head on whether he wrote a prescription for my own opioid based medicine or any other pain medicine or advised using  over the counter medicines. She all but begged me not to take ibuprofen and get back to a doctor if I’m in pain.",AskDocs,t3_dkbhk7
"Codeine allergy or side effect?19 y/o white female, 5'3"", 80 kg, UK

I recently had a breast reduction, and was prescribed codeine for pain after the surgery. I had surgery from 2-6pm, took 6 tablets over the course of the next day (as advised) and felt a bit groggy but overall alright. The morning after that I took another 2 tablets and began to feel very nauseous. Moving my head, blinking or closing my eyes at all made me feel really sick and I spent all morning staring at a blank wall trying to keep still. I didn't eat or drink a lot because I felt so ill.

Around lunchtime I suddenly felt ready to vomit, and when I retched to vomit I had a seizure for a couple of seconds. Arms shooting out in a T pose and going rigid, head and eyes rolling back and groaning while I vomited. I felt back to normal after coming to, not ill at all. Called an ambulance and paramedics arrived in 15 minutes. Had low BP but otherwise no issues.

In the back of the ambulance I began to feel ill again and had a seizure while vomiting again, this time throwing up a much larger volume of liquid. Again felt better for it, but again started to feel worse after a little time. Lying down seemed to be worse than sitting up.

Stayed in hospital for the afternoon, given anti-nausea tablets and eventually felt okay again. Was told not to take any more codeine, and prescribed more anti-nausea meds in case. We asked for other painkillers as I was very recently out of surgery, but was told that any other painkillers would likely give the same reaction but worse.

Was this an allergy or a side effect? I know nausea is a common side effect of codeine but the doctors implied that it was an allergy and I'm not sure whether after this I'm just not supposed to take codeine in future.",AskDocs,t3_dkbf8a

"Weird Headaches After Vestibular NeuritisHello,

I am a 24 year old female on no meds who was diagnosed with a case of vestibular neuritis, beginning August 17th. I woke up that day extremely dizzy and nauseous, vomited twice, and had some diarrhea. The dizziness (spinning, like vertigo), lasted another two days, though no more vomiting. It started to get a bit better, and then the dizziness rapidly shifted feeling - from spinning to rocking, as if I was on a boat. I was taking Gravol to control the ensuing nausea (as I am already quite prone to motion sickness). Initially I was unable to read or look at a computer, but I was able to lie down and watch mindless TV. These symptoms gradually abated after about 7 weeks. 

During this time I went to see two ENTs and a neurologist, and had an MRI (on August 27th, found to be normal). After describing my symptoms, I was diagnosed with vestibular neuritis rather than vestibular migraines (that was a concern, as I am generally prone to migraines, though never before have I experienced something of this nature), since I was not experiencing headaches during this time.

At my last appointment with my ENT on September 20th, the doctor had me lie down with my head hanging over the edge of the table to test how I felt. I immediately felt nauseous, and when I went home I wasn’t feeling well and I went to sleep. I woke up and felt quite intense pressure in my neck and at the top left side of my head.

Since this time I have had these odd pressure-pain headaches almost every day. They travel around, generally beginning at the base of my skull, to follow along to either the top left or right of my head, and often concentrate near my temples (above my ear). At first I thought they might be tension headaches, but I also feel tenderness around the areas where the pain is, and it’s been weeks that I’ve had these symptoms now. Neither regular Advil, Tylenol, nor Voltaren/Naproxen alleviate the pain, and I’m starting to worry that there’s something wrong.

I have also had some jaw pain on-and-off since August, and although this might be potentially unrelated, I have had symptoms of costichondritis as well as soreness around the joints in my arms and my lower legs since early September.

I am getting quite anxious, and I do not know what to do - I know what normal headaches and migraines feel like, and these aren’t them. Does anyone have any ideas? Should I consider getting another MRI, considering the headache symptoms started about a month after the initial dizziness (and thus after my first - and only - MRI)?

"What might this be? A genetically determined knee malfunction?Long story short, in my family my mom aunt and me all have the same problem with our knee for which I've never found any explanation or name for online. Wanted to know if anyone recognizes it.

The problem with the knee is temporarily, usually when it's bend in a specific way for some time. It feels like some ligaments in the knee get stuck over each other, my mom and I call it having our knee locked. It hurts like hell, and you can't straighten your leg when it happens. Someone has to physically pull on your leg, and then it pops right out and the pain is also gone instantly but your leg feels a bit weak some time after.

There have been situations where I got this while being alone, which was pretty bad because you have to pull out your own leg while it hurts, which isn't easy to do. Lately I haven't been getting it, but as a kid I used to have them pretty regular. When in the schoolyard kids always had to run to get my brother, who would then pull my leg out so the pain would be gone.

Does anyone know what this 'condition' might be? What really would be happening in my knee? I can't find anything about it online, because if I search for it I only find information about dislocated knees, which this definitely isn't.

I smoke weed, but often we end up using the wrap of a cigarello in order to wrap up the weed in- which worries me. On top of this for a while I used pens, which is weed condensed down into oil, which I then stopped because of not knowing what was even in them. 

Near my gums, I have skin that seems to be “pulling back”. I can link a picture.

"Slightly problematic blood tests but nobody seems to know why. Hoping someone can offer insight please!Hi! 35 Female here. 127 lbs, 5’6. Regularly jog 3-6 miles and do yoga. Eat pretty healthily. Don’t drink much. Having some weird blood tests. Sorry for the long post but it’s a lot of weird, maybe related, issues. 

Basically, this summer, I had a CBC cause I had some swollen lymph nodes and pain in my side. Doctor did a CBC, mono test, and neck/abdominal CT. CT was normal other than mentioning some swollen lymphatic tissue in the oral pharynx but nobody batted an eye at that. Mono negative. But the blood test revealed low hemoglobin (12.9)and MCHC (31%) (RBC count itself was ok) that indicated mild anemia. 

I started taking iron pills and returned two weeks later for another CBC. The anemia numbers had popped back up to just over the edge of normal (hemoglobin 13.1, MCHC 32%). This time though, he did the CBC with differential and it revealed a low percentage of neutrophils (39%), a high percentage of lymphocytes (50%), and the number of granulocytes was 1.65 (low). 

So, my doctor thought those were fine even though they were off, and agreed to do the blood test again in 3 months. 

Now, in the 2.5 months since then, I’ve continued to take iron, but I also got this random never ending period. Got in contact with my OB doctor over this. He did a progesterone test and it was low. An ultrasound too that cane back normal. I took 10 days of some progesterone pill, it stopped the bleeding, had a normal period but got another one two weeks later and just went to see the OB in person this past week. He did a CBC of his own, a thyroid test, and a test of the endometrial lining. My thyroid function was normal. Haven’t heard on the lining yet. 

But, the CBC. 13.9 hemoglobin, 34.2 MCHC. So yay, no anemia. But my percentage of neutrophils is still low 32.7%, and my lymphocyte percentage is still high, 55.9%. Yet, the actual numbers of lymphocytes and neutrophils are in the normal range, if barely. 1504 neutrophils, 2571 lymphocytes. My OB called and described my white counts as normal though. 

Some other things to consider.... I didn’t mention it yet, but on every single blood test I’ve taken since 2015, my MPV has been high, even when everything else is normal. Anywhere from 13-14. I don’t know if that means anything or is related to any of the other numbers. 

And, since August, I’ve had off and on sore throats with no other cold symptoms. I pop acid reflux medicine and allergy medication but it doesn’t help. The last couple weeks, my voice sounds kind of hoarse to me. Lower, like I’m tired. My OB suggested I go to an ENT for that since my thyroid test was normal. 

I should also mention that when I was pregnant in 2017 I had a super low platelet count, but that came up again after pregnancy and remains in the 200ish range. None of the white counts were off like this back then. 

So with this whole picture here, can anyone shed some light on this? I’d be very much appreciative. My mom works in another state as an oncology nurse, and she showed these numbers to the doctor she works under and she advised that I see a hematologist, but any doctor I have doesn’t seem concerned (my OB and primary care) and I don’t want to sound like a lunatic demanding to see a hematologist cause obviously I’d need referred.

2 months ago - Chest Pains got worse and more frequent. Thought it could have something to do with possible irregular heart beat so I went to the ER. They did an ECG, and blood tests (Chem 8, Diner Quantitative, Hemogram, Thyroid Panel, Troponin). Nothing unusual except I was a little low in iron. They were certain the chest pains were not caused by my heart. I left the ER diagnosed with Sinus Tachycardia and Mild Microcytic Anemia.

Few Days After ER Visit - Noticed a pain in my neck that was not unlike my chest pain. Sharp, didn't last more than a minute, and random. I had started taking iron supplements the same day I left the ER, and knew that Iron Supplements can cause acid reflux, so I told myself it was probably that.

3 days ago - Still getting chest pain as well as throat pain, although seemingly much more infrequent. Had felt a lot better after the ER visit since I knew it had nothing to do with my heart, and had kind of learned to ignore the pain. 
I was talking to my roommate, just swinging my arms back and forth when I got terrible pain in my chest. I tried to ignore it, so I took some Ibuprofen and went to bed.

Yesterday - Woke up around 6am without chest or neck pain, but noticed a tingling in my right arm. Thought I slept on it wrong and just went about my day, but it never went away. Around 1 I felt extremely tired, and so I laid down for 20 minutes but accidentally slept for 6 hours. That's never happened before. When I woke up, I had pain in my neck, my right shoulder, and my right upper arm. The muscle in my upper arm also felt weak. I still felt tingling in that arm as well. I was also starting to feel tingling and pain in my left arm. I stayed up for a couple more hours and then went to sleep and to my surprise, I slept through the whole night even with my super long nap.

Today - I wake up and feel completely fine. No pain, No tingling, nothing. Until around midday. The tingling is better. In fact, hardly noticeable. I am however, feeling pain in what feels like the muscles all over my body. I'm also getting muscle spasms all over,  especially my stomach. The pain isn't bad, it just feels like I worked out and all of my muscles are sore.

I'm so confused as to what this is. A pinched nerve? Magnesium Defiency? I really want to avoid going to the ER if I can help it. The last two times I went were kind of pointless. Does anyone have any advice, suggestions, or suspicions as to what this is? I just feel so frustrated.",AskDocs,t3_dkcziw

"Lymphoma? Or other infection?Hi,

My mother (age 67) recently went to the hospital to have a kidney stone removed, and when she had bloodwork done before the surgery, the doctors noticed her WBC count was very high (70 - when the normal range is 4 - 10). She also has high lymphocytes and monocytes. Everything else is normal range. She has been healthy most of her life and hasn't had any major health problems. She doesn't eat the healthiest foods but is active and stays away from most sweets. The docs gave her antibiotics while in the hospital and after the kidney stone procedure (which went well) her WBC count was down to 20. She was released from the hospital and has been getting her blood checked each month since. Fast forward 3 months and she doesn't feel fatigued but says sometimes her lymph nodes swell for a day or 2 then go back down. Her WBC count has gone up again since being in the hospital and is back at 70.  She is scheduled for a lymph node biopsy but wanted to ask if there is any chance what she is experiencing is anything other than lymphoma? Why did her white blood cell count go down so much from the antibiotics while she was in the hospital? If lymphoma is causing the WBC to be high, wouldn't her WBC count stay high regardless of antibiotics in her system??   Her moncytes went down a bit from her last test but they are still out of ""normal"" range.

"Have had neurological reactions now to both amoxicillin and cephalexin37/M/6'2""/210 lbs

Meds: Lorazepam, Diazepam, Paroxetine, Quetiapine, Bisoprolol

Related conditions: Benzodiazepine dependence, myoclonus, Tourette's

I am 37 and have been on daily benzodiazepines since I was 14.

I had a really bad experience with Cipro a long time ago, and I found out that fluoroquinolones are contraindicated in benzodiazepine dependence.

I then about a year ago took 2 g amoxicillin for a dental surgery (later found out I didn't really need it). Right about an hour after taking it, I felt like I was in cold turkey benzo withdrawal. Was in hell trying to make it through the rest of the appointment (kept feeling like I was falling and seeing lightning and like my brain was just ""clipping"" off over and over again). The following two weeks I had increased myoclonus, rapid heart rate, trouble sleeping and eating, nonstop sweating—basically all signs of benzo withdrawal.

My PCP sent me to a neurologist who did an EEG and found some abnormality---something about beta waves, but said it was probably related to the benzodiazepines and wasn't serious.

It took about two weeks to get back to baseline.

I recently had to take cephalexin which I thought would be OK since I actually have been on that before without incident while on benzodiazepines.

I was fine for the first part of the day and then I had what I would describe as delirium I've had before when trying to get off benzos---having the types of thoughts you would have as if you were falling asleep and wanting to sleep but not being able to. Then later racing really fast in my head. I had an unbearable ""seizury"" feeling. I don't have a good way to describe it. It's sort of like my brain felt like a flip-book. I was hoping it was one off and felt a bit better the next day, but the next day the same symptoms happened around the exact same times in relation to when I had taken the cephalexin.

I have read that these types of antibiotics compete for the same GABA-A and benzodiazepine receptor sites that benzodiazepine drugs do.

This is an overview of the neurotoxcicity of antibiotics:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175508/pdf/bcp0072-0381.pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175508/pdf/bcp0072-0381.pdf)

And this one relates specifically to cephalosporins:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12871648](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12871648)

It says that benzodiazepines are used to treat the convulsive effects of cephalosporins, and so if you have extreme tolerance to benzos, maybe I then am easily set into a benzo withdrawal by taking a cephalosporin?

My doctor said I could stop the cephalexin, and unlike with the amoxicillin, I seem to feel better much more quickly after stopping the cephalexin than I did after stopping the amoxicillin which took a couple of weeks to recover from.

I am concerned that I am effectively in a post-antibiotic age because I can't seem to tolerate antibiotics.

I may have other neurological problems beyond the benzo dependence. From a young age I would have weird shocks and jerks. From the time I was an infant, I was told that I would have a weird ""shocked"" appearance if a car passed outside the house, for example, whereas other kids wouldn't notice it. And even now if there's an air conditioner on and it suddenly turns off, the absence of the noise gives me a shock feeling temporarily.

I've also been told I may have a pituitary tumor because my total testosterone is 80 and I have low-to-normal LH and FSH and normal testicles. They haven't been able to get me still enough for an MRI of the sella to check due to the Tourette's.",AskDocs,t3_dka210

Some background: My PCM did an ultrasound on my heart in March '18 because I was having palpitations and shortness of breath while hiking or doing anything really physical. The ultrasound came back showing Mild Regurgitation in my Mitral, Tricuspid, and Pulmonary valves and mild Diastolic Dysfunction and an EF of 70%. She referred me to a Cardiologist and I had an echocardiogram done in August '18 and a 48 hr holter monitor in October '18.

"Colic aftermath: question about CRP value32F, 1.59m, 63kg

So last Tuesday night I had a colic. I've had them before and this one was 'comparable' to the others - but I've had more painful colics in the past. The difference with this colic was that after the pain receded, there was some leftover pain. I felt a fullness in my abdomen and putting pressure on it was quite painful (lower right), some movement and deep breaths were also painful.

So the next day when the pain still wasn't gone I called the doctors office to ask at what point I should make an appointment with them. And after asking about my symptoms they planned me in for the next morning.

On Thursday the gp and I talked about my colic, abdominal pain and related issues (lazy bowel - trouble pooping). Apparently the colics could be related to that, so she started me on Sandoz. But she also tested my blood for inflammation to rule out diverticulitis and appendicitis (the pain was still there on Thursday - but a bit less). My CRP value was elevated (70), so she ordered me to come back the next day (Friday) to check again.

When we tested on Friday morning it was 35 - so it's getting better! She told me to keep track of my symptoms and call in if they get worse. I had some small pains yesterday - but I'm pain free today.

Now to my question: I googled the CRP value because I didn't know what those values meant. And I read that less than 3 is desirable, less than 10 is acceptable and 100+ is really an issue. So in my (uneducated) mind 70 is quite high (2 days after the colic), and 35 is still high! But: after the colic I didn't feel sick - I just had some pain. I maybe was a little more tired than normal and sometimes my eyes were burning a little. So on one hand I'm a little proud of my body - apparently handling an inflammation without bothering me much. But I'm also a little worried about that: how can I know my body is doing ok if I don't have symptoms?

Now this is more a question for later because I'm fine now, but: what symptoms should I get when my body isn't winning the fight with an inflammation? And is it normal to feel quite normal with those CRP values?

"Question about my ear constantly twitching?Age: 21, Sex: Female, Height: 5'1, Weight: 120 lbs, Race: Black,

Primary Complaint: my right ear constantly twitches in the same place. It isn't the entire ear and there are weeks where nothing happens, so *constant* might not be the right word, but it might be find for weeks, but then when it comes, it's twitching and twitching in these annoying spasms every other second, even while I'm sleeping (which I figure is the case bc those 2 days of constant twitching will include me waking to it twitching). Sometimes, it'll be one twitch per minute (longest is a minute and a half), and other times it'll twitch 2 to 3 times in succession, then pause for a bit, then back to twitching to 2 to 3 times in succession. It only started this June and, considering I was taking a summer class at my college, I thought it was a stress thing, but it hasn't gone away. I don't drink, smoke, or do recreational drugs. The most I do is drink a lot of coke or coffee (decaf tho bc caffeine either does nothing or makes me tired). Then I thought it was a case of me not getting a lot of sleep, but I had plenty of sleepless nights for the past years in college and have never had this happen (and I pretty much sleep longer this year bc I have less classes).

I don't know if this is serious or anything, but it's an annoyance for the 1-2 days every few weeks. It's such a short span of time in the grand scheme, but it drives me up the wall. I can place my hand over my ear and feel my ear just pulsing from the same location. I have no idea why it's just my right ear or why it's my ear that's twitching anyway. And I can't sleep on my right side when my ear's like this bc it just sounds like something's loudly moving (and something is!)

So, if anyone has any ideas or recommendations, I'm all ears (pun intended).

Edit: Just thought to add that I have anemia. I don't know if that'll clarify anything, tho it doesn't clarify anything on my end (I've had anemia my whole life and the twitching of my ear only started a few months ago).

Issue: So I've tried to find out about this issue online, but could only find one other post. I feel like I've looked everywhere, so I'm coming here for suggestions. To get right into it, whenever I get hungover from getting drunk the night before, I get pins and needles sensations in my body. I get these feelings in my chest and face mainly. They are not painful in anyway, just uncomfortable. It does not happen right away, but after a few hours after waking up in the morning. It seems to come in waves, meaning I get them all over my body, they stop for a little, then come back. This happens for most of the day after drinking. My heart also pounds and palpitates every once in a while when hungover, but I assumed that was normal for being hungover. I noticed I can actually trigger these sensations in two ways. Either moving around a lot (i.e. being in a car on a really bumpy road) or just from laughing a lot. I also want to note that if I get them really bad, I end up feeling pretty dizzy and out of it, but that could also be from me panicking since it scares me. I've tried taking a B complex, and multivitamins, and drinking a lot of electrolytes the day after, but they don't help. This only happens when I'm hungover. I've never gotten them without being really hungover. I typically drink once every week or two, and this only happens if I get pretty drunk.

The pain was about an 8, and I debated going back to the Er but an hour after taking one of the oxycodones I felt a little better, back down to a 6 and was able to put ice on my kidney to help me go back to sleep. Thursday during the day wasn’t bad, I just slept a lot. I still have nausea throughout the day but no vomiting. Friday morning rolls around and the pain is back and it’s like a 5. I’m scheduled to get the stent out at 8am so I show up to the ER and have it removed. Within an hour I’m back at the ER, my pain is now a ten and I’m puking non stop. They do a CT and see I still have a stone, 4mm in my left kidney (the side surgery was done on). Now I’ve had a lot of stones in the past, but never with pain like this except one time where I was ad,titled to the hospital for a few days, but that was a 19mm I had lithotripsy on. I also am told I have a bladder infection. The doctor said If the pain gets bad again to come back because they’ll likely do surgery again. 

So last night, at about midnight I woke up and the pain was about a 6 again, so not something I’d have gone to the ER for before, but then I start vomiting again. I decide to try and sleep it off and have mild success. Today I was feeling better and tried to be active, but after about 30 minutes (just showering and putting clothes on) of moving around I had broken a sweat,  and was exhausted so I stayed home. I kept getting “hot flashes” but not feeling warm or fever like to my boyfriend. I took a cool shower and laid down for another 20 minutes before I just woke up and puked again. The pain isn’t that bad, but the nausea is killing me. I haven’t been able to eat a solid meal since Tuesday because everything until yesterday made me nauseous and now everything I eat I’m throwing up. The pain seems to be spiking with the vomiting, so while it’s a 3 or 4 normally, it gets to be a 6 when I’m getting sick.


 Is the vomiting worth going back to the ER alone? The vomiting doesn’t seem to correspond time wise with when I’m taking the medication",AskDocs,t3_dkbuxx

"[M36] Prednisone withdrawlLong time lurker. Input appreciated. 

The last month has been the worst health month of my life. I’m a healthy and active person. Normal weight. Exercise 5-6 days a week, running/cycling/resistance training. I came down with a cold while traveling. On the flight home my left ear became clogged due to my congestion. I had an ear block that would not clear for five days. 

The cold I had turned into an ear infection in my left ear and a sinus infection. Ear became clogged again, this time with fluid. Started amoxicillin, turns out I’m resistant to that, and was then prescribed cefuroxime.  The amoxicillin constipated me, and the cefuroxime made my stools soft. I was not having good bowel movements and I developed a hemorrhoid. Treated that with prep H. 

Left ear still had fluid and a clogged feeling even after the cefuroxime. Saw an ENT who gave me prednisone.  25 mg doses, two days of three doses, two days of two, two days of one, and two days of a half dose. 

The prednisone gave me insomnia, made me emotional, and aggravated my stomach. Just a constant tense feeling in the stomach. I stopped it after the second day of one 25 mg dose. I just couldn’t take side effects anymore. I also finished my run of antibiotics that day. 

I became diarrheal for three days afterwards, and experienced fatigue and light headedness. The diarrhea went away, but the fatigue and light headedness has persisted. Also a feeling of weakness. I understand that fatigue, weakness and light headedness are symptoms of prednisone withdrawal. 

When would one expect the withdrawal symptoms to abate? I find myself incapable and unmotivated to exercise like I normally do. I get light headed and completely exhausted throughout the day, but especially at the end of the day.

Got some Ice, swelling faded, pain was acceptable, could use all my fingers and went on with my day.

Everything was normal until about 2 hours ago. I started to notice that my little finger and ring finger started getting numb. Numbness increased fast and it also started to tingle a bit.

Im a pretty chilled person when it comes to injury and started to look it up on Dr. Google. Apparently there is not a sub Category for contusions on the back of the hand and only found info on numb fingers right after getting the injury but nothing on 'no swelling but suddendly numb fingers'.

His prostate is enlarged but he tested negative on a blood test for cancer.

Hi everyone, 

Thank you for helping in advance!

Basically for the last week I've been experiencing symptoms of a common cold (cough, congestion when I wake up in the morning, no fever, no headache though). The cough isn't what I would call a 'chest cough' yet though, meaning I'm not coughing up any phelmn (probably spelled wrong, sorry). There are two things of note though that I'm just wondering about.

1. For the past two mornings, I've been waking up with gunk all around my eyes -- on the inner corner, on my lash line, and somewhat in my eyelashes. Some of it is wet, some of it is dried and crusty. My eyes are ever so slightly red, but not enough to be of note. I wear contact lenses occasionally, but I haven't for the past week or so. I've been wiping it off with a wet (clean) face towel in the morning.
2. Secondly, I've never had experiences with swollen lymph nodes, but I can't help but feel like they are this time. I'm not a doctor (so I don't know how to do a proper procedural check; however, whenever I touch approximately where they are, the lymph nodes (or what I think they are) feel quite round, and prominent. Almost sticking out, but not in an obvious manner (for instance, touching them). I can also feel them when I'm eating/laughing/swallowing.

At the time, I was around 240 Lbs, 5 Feet 3 inches, I didn't take any medication, didn't smoke or drink, and had mainly mental health issues (Anxiety, depression, PTSD.) Still, I'm really curious as to why this happened.

One day, I ate lunch, and then a few minutes after, something weird happened. The skin around my arms turned red, and I felt an extremely sharp pins-and-needles feeling when touching them, and my arm hairs were standing on end. It quickly spread to my whole body within a few minutes, and it was one of the most painful things I've ever been through. I felt the pins-and-needles EVERYWHERE, and it was so strong that I felt cold. When I sat on a chair, my whole butt felt extremely cold and it stung, and when I wore a blanket it affected my whole body.

Here's the weird part; That was the only time it's ever happened. I wondered if it was something I ate, but I just ate a PB&amp;J sandwich, and I'm not allergic to anything in that. In fact, I ate peanut butter the next day and I was totally fine.

So for some reason I’ve been having headaches for a few days now. I wake up usually okay but as the day goes on I develop a headache and feel some muscle soreness in the back of my neck. Maybe I slept on it wrong? Also I worked out last Monday and felt that maybe I strained myself a bit while doing T-bar rows and might have been the cause to my neck pain.

"Had ear fullness and a tinnitus spike for about 40 hours, even though my cold is mostly gone24m, 5'9, 150lbs, caucasian, ear fullness, about 30 hours straight, don't drink a ton, don't smoke or do drugs.

The short version is I got a cold last week and the peak of it was yesterday morning. I blew my nose, apparently a bit too hard and felt really bad inner ear fullness instantly. I tried clearing my ears (that thing where you hold your nose and blow gently), as well as yawning a ton but it didn't do anything. I waited all day yesterday for it to go away and it's stayed exactly the same. And when I woke up this morning it still feels identical even though my cold is mostly gone and I can breathe clearly through my nose.

I don't think it's an inner ear air pressure issue, as I can definitely feel my inner ear pressure change when I clear/yawn, but I'm thinking it's probably mucous stuck in my inner ear and/or a sinus infection.

I do have nasonex in my cabinet so I might try that, do you think it's worth going to the doctor now or wait a bit longer?

For the record I already had tinnitus before, mostly in my other ear, but this is a completey different tone and also my ear feels very ""full"" and muffled, so it's not normal.",AskDocs,t3_dk9tv3
"Lots of cramps on my quadriceps after bad bruising, is this normal?Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

I was downhill mountain biking and hit a tree very fast with my quadriceps, this was last Friday. Initially I couldn't put any weight on the leg, I stayed in bed doing ""RICE"" for 2 days and it was getting better, I regained a lot of movement. I went to the doctor to make sure I was ok and he said it was just a bruise. On Tuesday I decided to go to work and by the end of the day the leg got much worse. Overall I'm slowly regaining movement but a new problem that worries me has developed on Tuesday or Wednesday: Cramping.

&amp;#x200B;

Whenever my leg is still for a period of 5 or more minutes and then I move it I get some painful cramps that last about 20 seconds, this can happen in a few different spots depending on which muscle is moved. This happens several times during the night because I need to change positions when the leg is hurting and then the cramp comes, it's been very difficult to sleep. It also happens a lot during the day because of normal moves that I need to do (going washroom, getting up, sitting, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Are these cramps normal? I was worried since things started getting worse on Tuesday/Wednesday and these cramps started happening so I went to the doctor again on Friday (Yesterday), he also said it was probably just a bruise and he didn't address the cramps question.

"Not sure if I have a ruptured eardrumYesterday I was playing with my nephew and he accidentally kicked my head right around my ear.

**Symptoms:**

* **Immediate Reaction:** Mild pain, but mostly, my hearing was all out of wack.
* Pain subsided and now it’s just achey.
* Had a major headache about 4 or 5 hours after, woke up with one throughout the night, and woke up this morning with one.
* No puss, blood or liquid has come out of the ear

**Description of Hearing Issues:**

* I can hear out of both ears, if I cover one up, it seems like I can hear fine out of the other.
* When both are uncovered it’s kinda like I have something blocking my hearing.
* When I’m in my apartment, generally my hearing doesn’t bother me, because it’s relatively silent.
* But I went out to walk my dogs and went to the grocery store, there’s lots of noise and I can hear but everything is kind of jumbled together, it’s hard to distinct sounds from one another. And in these situations if someone tries to talk to me, I can only hear them if they’re speaking in my direction or right beside me, otherwise it sounds mumbled.
* When I hear music, it doesn’t necessarily sound off-tune but it doesn’t sound right and I’m very sensitive to bass, it doesn’t hurt my ear but it’s irritating.

**Additional Information:**

* I have a doctor’s appointment set up with my PCP on Thursday, because I don’t think it’s serious enough for emergency medical attention.
* I haven’t used q-tips since this happened, nor have I blown my nose.
* I showered earlier but read that if it is a ruptured eardrum, I shouldn’t get it wet, so I used a cotton ball with petroleum jelly because I hate ear plugs.
* I took Aleve to get rid of the headache

**My background:**

* 23F, 5’4, 128 lbs, Caucasian
* Medications:
   * Birth Control - Tri-Sprintec 28-Day oral tablets - Daily
   * Vyvanse (25mg XR) and Adderall (20mg IR) for ADHD, I don’t take these everyday, only when I’m having trouble focusing or completing work.
* I don’t smoke or take recreational drugs - I drink, maybe once or twice a month.
* Related past health issues:
   * When I was 2, I had horrible ear infections, so I had tubes put in my ears but those wouldn’t stay in so I had surgery, but to be honest, I don’t remember any specifics.
   * When I was 3, I had what I think is called fluid behind my ears? I was just laying down one day and when I stood up, I couldn’t keep my balance, I kept falling and eventually got to where I could only lay down because I couldn’t hold my head up. I was taken to the emergency room, treated and then for the next week or so my eyes were bloodshot and had to be followed everywhere because I would randomly lose balance.
   * No ear related issues since then.

**My questions:**

* Do I have a ruptured eardrum?
   * Most people I know that have had this, and from what I read, had puss or blood coming from the ear, but only my hearing is affected and it’s kind of achey.
* What should I do to protect it?
* Should I change anything about my normal routines, i.e. medications?
* How long generally will it take to
   * a.) heal
   * b.) for my hearing to go back to normal?
* And will my hearing ever be as good as it was?

"35 y/o Male with Hair Shedding for 6+ MonthsI've always had a good head of thick black hair. Recently I've started to notice that after running shampoo in my head in the shower, there would be a few hairs that came out in my hand (typically 5-10 hairs). Same when I'm towel drying.

&amp;#x200B;

My observable symptoms

* Hairs that are shedding are full thick hairs
* Hairs are following out from all locations in my head. Not just the top, but sides too

&amp;#x200B;

I realize that I'm at the age where these things start happening, but I figured I should investigate properly nonetheless. I made appointments with both my primary doctor and a dermatologist.

What my primary did (2 visits in a span of a month):

* Ran a blood test.
   * results showed borderline anemia (Ferritin: 17 ng/mL, Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL, Hematocrit: 38.2%). I found that very odd considering I'm a healthy individual who works out 3x a week and eats plenty of red meat (among other things containing iron).
* Did a rectal exam and a urin test to see if I was losing blood anywhere (which could cause anemia). Both came up negative.
* She recommended taking an iron supplement to see if that would improve my iron levels. After taking 65mg daily for a month, my Ferritin increased from 17 to 20 ng/mL and she deemed me no longer borderline anemic.

My primary's conclusion: She's come to the conclusion that my hair shedding is from simple male pattern baldness and is not related to my low iron levels, but she recommended I get it checked out by a dermatologist just to play it safe.

&amp;#x200B;

What my dermatologist did (3 visits within the span of 2 months):

* Did a physical observation of my scalp and hair
   * He found dandruff and also observed that hair seems to be shedding from all areas of my head, not just the typical areas that experience male pattern baldness.
   * He recommended a topical steroid for the dandruff and an iron supplement to boost iron levels
* He did a biopsy of my scalp
   * Biopsy results indicated ""early onset androgenetic alopecia"". He said this is normal for someone my age, but that the hair shedding seemed ""outside the norm"" for early onset AGA.

My dermatologist's conclusion: He's of the opinion that low iron could absolutely be contributing to hair loss. He says that ""something is going on here"" that is not just normal male pattern baldness. He's now recommending I see a different dermatologist that ""only does hair all day and every day""

The last few years I’ve experienced the same thing, to a lesser degree, about 3-4 times. I don’t know if this was a reaction to the stomach pain or an anxiety attack, even though I didn’t feel overwhelming anxiety until I was already well into the reaction.

"Horrible Migraines DailyAge: 34 Sex: Male Weight: 90kg Height 182cm

Greetings and thanks in advance for reading.

I've been having these migraines for years now, they come and go, some times i wake up with them, sometimes i develop them during the day and they stay there for the entire day.

I have also noticed that when i'm in the car or at work, they immediately trigger if an **Air Condition unit** is blowing at my general direction. its almost immediate when the ACs go on (I feel the pain and i know the ACs are on before i even check)

The pain is sometimes pulsating, and at work with the ac for example, it feels like pressure mounting in my head sometimes around my nostril/eye. If i step outside for 15 mins it goes away. I walk back in and in 10 mins its the same. It sometimes causes sensitivity to light, and the pain makes me feel like my head is warmer on that side. The aircondition is almost a surefire, but its not the only way i get them, its just an observation that i almost certainly will get one when the air hits me.

I know it sounds like a Sinus infection, and that's what i also thought, i went to 2 EMTs, both used a camera, saw a some obstruction on my right nostril (the same side that these migraines occur, like, 70-30%) but didn't see enough evidence to indicate sinus infection.

My right side is also the side i sleep on, and some times i wake up already in pain.

When im out drinking beer and i have a few, they also start.

I used nasal wash in the past but not for long, something like 3-4 days in a row. It is frustrating me as it keeps me from doing things, alters my mood, in general makes me a very low-energy person.

"Uncomfortable feeling in the lower left flankHey,

I'm a Caucasian 22M, 175cm tall, roughly 72kg. Apart from asthma I have no other chronic illnesses or any other periodic medical issues. I have relatively few fevers or colds, sometimes barely once a year. I do not smoke but I do drink, roughly 2 or 3 times per month (excess drinking). Currently I am on no medication. I do not work out regularly and I spend a lot of my time sitting, usually with a bad posture too. I'm relatively skinny with a slightly bulging gut (I guess you can call it a dad bod?) and I would call myself a sugar-addict aswell. Though I've started consuming significantly less sugar now (the past year or so) than previously.

For the past two months or so I've been having discomfort in my lower left flank, approximately just below the rib cage. There's no physical pain related to this uncomfortable feeling whatsoever, and the best way I can describe the feeling is that it is a pressure inwards almost and the feeling is much more apparent while sitting. Some days it is not as apparent (usually when I'm at university at moving around a lot) and some days it's constant (usually when I'm home and sitting down). It's worth to mention that during these two months I haven't experienced any other uncommon medical issues apart from this discomfort in my abdomen. I have, however, felt very stressed and been anxious due to university and personal life.

Any help is appreciated. I'd feel much more at ease knowing what it is, because my stress-level usually increases when I start getting into an evil cycle of thinking that it might be a symptom of a life-threatening illness.

My symptoms are burning vaginal pain, occasional pelvic pain, and worst of all, intense unpleasant odours. To begin with the smells was just of chips (fries) but as time passes it has diversified. The most frequent and strong smells are: chips, garlic, urine, and a musty smell. I've also had the smell of paint and mould before but not so much recently. Just today I had a new smell - toast. These smells don't so much come out of my body - they almost instantly fill the entire room that I enter. This is incredibly humiliating, and I can't predict when it's going to happen. The fact that the smells are occurring is not up for debate (sorry to be rude but I've had several doctors say it's in my head because the smells don't occur when I'm seeing them). I've had people at work mention the smells to my face and behind my back, people get up and move away from me on public transport, my housemate sprays bleach around the house to get rid of the smells I'm producing.

I used to be producing smells about 20% of the time, now I'd say I'm up to 50%. I struggle to eat sometimes because the smells make me feel nauseated.

Here is the difficult part. I have seen eight doctors already but as this is not a routine complaint they haven't been much help, and I'm starting to run out of money. Often they will send me away telling me there is nothing wrong. Google hasn't helped either, no one else seems to have gone through this. I'm currently halfway through a two-week antibiotic treatment (metronidazole, doxycycline, and a member of the penicillin family - they didn't specify when injecting me). It does not seem to be helping at all. I've also previously been given week-long antifungal treatments which didn't help as I obviously don't have a yeast infection, I'm not itchy. I've been tested twice for all STIs - negative for everything. I've been tested five times for BV, negative every time. No trichomoniasis, no mycoplasma, no yeast infection. 'Normal flora' according to swabs, the only thing they found was Group B Streptococcus.

The only thing I know is that I get the most relief with my period. Before, that meant no smell or pain during my period, but currently it's become so bad that there are still smells now even when on my period. Then after my period the pain and smells ramp up until they become unbearable.

This has been happening since late June. I will add that this whole thing started in mid-April, however the symptoms were different. To begin with, I had unpleasant fishy smells and the vaginal pain wasn't so bad. I went to the GP and she gave my clindamycin cream 2% but it didn't work, and eventually by mid June the fish smells evolved into my current nightmare. I wish I could go back to the fish smells, at least they didn't fill the room.

The vaginal pain is also very unpleasant - it's a burning pain, as if someone had squirted acid up there. My doctor said it looked very red and painful and also noticed that I had an ulcer, I suppose from the constant burning.

I've been on a vegan diet since January 2018 but have swtiched back to vegetarian recently in the hope that it might help. I've been taking supplements and will continue to do so. I had been taking probiotics religiously every day since mid April but stopped in September as I read that it could be making it worse. I tried home remedies - apple cider vinegar, coconut oil, tea tree oil, bicarb. I tried leaving it alone. Nothing I try makes it better, it only gets worse and worse.

So timeline: Mid April symptoms started, end of June my current unusual symptoms began. 6 months of hell so far, the past 4 being increasingly unbearable.

I have been suicidal for the past two months because of the humiliating nature of this unknown disease. I don't want to kill myself as my life is otherwise happy but I know for a fact that I cannot continue to live like this for much longer. I've become a social recluse, I'm failing at work because I try to hide away and a love life is of course out of the question. I have a suicide plan but I'm trying my hardest to stick it out with this horrible life in a disgusting body I can't stand the smell of, on the off chance that I might get better one day. Thank you in advance for any help you might be able to offer.

Height and Weight: 5'7"" 88kg

Male

Medications: Fluoxetine 20mg daily.


I've had this since I was a teenager and while its not a problem, I've been really wondering what it could be caused by and have never been able to find documentation of similar things.

My hands, particularly my palms and between my fingers, occasionally become extremely sensitive to touch. If I rub them together or scratch at them I end up getting a very warm tingling that spreads up through the palm, up the arm and then into my chest where it concentrates and stays. It's not like a numbness, and oddly the only way I can describe it is an extremely pleasurable tickling. I hesitate to use the word orgasmic but thats sort of what it feels like.

This on occasion happens to the soles of my feet when I've been walking a lot as well. Again, the same feeling happens but it originates from my feet.

It doesn't seem to be a real pressing issue, but I've been curious about what could actually cause that for a long time now.",AskDocs,t3_dk8ajz

"Interpretation of nerve studies (EMG)Age 36, male. Weight 190 lbs. Height 6'0.
Main issue: neuropathy, mainly sensory (pins and needles, abnormal sensation and coordination / balance, unsteady gait).
I'm working with a neurologist, have been since about april. So far, I haven't received a definite diagnosis, as she isn't entirely sure what's causing my issues. A while back, I had some nerve conduction studies done, and something about the results and the way she interpreted them strikes me as odd. Here is the information that is reflected as abnormal in the EMGs of my arms and legs, however despite this, the impression by the doctor indicates the believes both to be essentially normal.

Lower EMG:
The left peroneal motor and right peroneal motor nerves showed reduced amplitude (L1.5, R1.1 mV -normal shown as &gt;2.5 mV). The left sural sensory nerve showed prolonged distal peak latency (6.3ms, right side is normal at 1.5ms) and decreased conduction velocity (calf-lat 22 m/s, right side normal value of 93 m/s). All remaining nerves within normal limits.

Upper EMG:
The right ulnar sensory nerve showed reduced amplitude (6.9 uV). All remaining nerves within normal limits. (for reference, the left ulnar sensory was 42.3 uV).

In my opinion, there are enough abnormalities in these results that I wonder about her interpretation. Am I right to question this? This is essentially evidence of neuropathy / nerve damage, right?",AskDocs,t3_dk87xy

I lost my health insurance, but before I did all tests were coming back normal.

This all started (seemingly) after a small injury to my left radial head. I began to suffer panic attacks, mood swings, depression, was agitated, can't focus well, etc. Fatigue has been around for about a month.

I have sensitivity to hot and cold (life-long), and exhaust very easily, though I am not out of shape. Example, I can ride a bicycle several miles easily until our temps here get above 100, and then even a 1 mile ride is excruciating.

Terrified of Pancreatic Cancer

hi there. im 24, female, only history of cancer in family is my aunt had cervical, nan breast and aunt on my dads side has breast. since about august ive noticed significant weight loss. i got invisalign so some could be due to that. but my weight fluctuated from around 9 st 6lbs to 9st, then 8st 13lbs last month.
i had stabbing pains in my mid left back that started a few weeks ago, i used to suffer low left back pain on and off but this felt deep and a bit higher. it hurt so much i was scared something inside was throbbing and when i ate lunch i had to sit down as i had pain wrapping round my abdomen and was worried something in my back was going to burst so i went to a and e and was given a blood test which was fine. i had dinner that night and was in pain again quite bad but had voltarol on my back and calmed down.
i started getting upper back pain between my shoulder blades recently and feel occasional pain in my left ribs near my stomach. This pain feels deep which is what scares me. My rib also felt bruised the other day. i got so obsessed with checking my stomach for pain i have kept pressing it and now its tender. i have extreme health anxiety because i saw about pancreatic cancer a week and a half ago and since then i feel like im feeling more symptoms.
i have been doing yellowish brown stools often. soft too. occasionally followed by yellowish mucus. i have also completely lost my appetite this week and i saw i was 8st 8lbs yesterday. i am so worried. all my bowel muscles hurt and i am getting pain round my pelvis, in my ribs and back and chest and shoulders.
i get a heavy painful ache in my back and tummy sometimes and my heart feels like its beating fast. my doctor has put me on beta blockers and antidepressants last week. i paid for an ultrasound and they couldnt see the pancreas tail but could see some of it and what they could see was fine but i know people miss things.
i am scared i could have a tumour on the tail where no one can see it. i managed to make myself eat a chocolate bar today then after 20 mins came over feeling so sick i had to lay down.
i have to make myself eat by swallowing the food with water and am only managing actimels, a banana, piece of toast or something a day.
im so scared the doctors are overlooking my issues and im going to die. i know hypochondria can make you feel symptoms but i dont get why my poo is yellowish. my last brown poo was frothy diarrhoea last week and since then soft yellow stools that smell sort or nutty/fishy. (sorry thats gross). i pass wind on the loo alot and i did have issues with poo before where i would get caught short and need to go. but not this often and not yellow. as well as flaky bits in the loo.
im so scared as i keep feeling pain in my ribs And dont want to lose anymore weight. i had a ca-19 blood test today and even as i type im feeling pain pushing on my right below my breast bone. i am on constant alert. im so scared my health is going to decline.
my doctor said she has been a gp for years and wants to reassure me i am fine im just stressed and anxious. she put me on omeprazole so my tummy burns less and the heavy back ache is less. ketones were also found in one of my last urine tests.
My doctor has put me on omeprazole for the burning heavy stomach pain and id had some blood in my stool for a few days but she wasnt worried.
do i sound genuinely ill with this or just very anxious?
my last poo that wasnt yellow was just watery diarrhoea with brighter froth on top. And before that id had a poo with partially digested veg in. I felt very concerned by this. I passed wind earlier and felt mucus and it came out in the toilet a creamy colour.
I then had a sandwich, had to stop eating cos my back hurt on the left side then had yellowy dark diarrhoea in the loo. The scales say 8st 7lb now but they are my partners so might be different?
I felt really dizzy and sick earlier but this may be due to the fluoxetine my doctor has given me. When i wipe on the toilet i have dark yellow mucus..
My partner also had her hand on my tummy earlier and a shooting pain went up under my left rib sort of under my breast? Im so scared it is the tail so it couldnt be detected on my ultrasound because of bowel gas.
I burp alot recently too. I lost my appetite gradually BEFORE being put on antidepressants and my stools were yellowish brown and my pee was oily. Ketones were found in my pee but doctor said its because i probably hadnt eaten. My stomach feels really tender and trapped wind-ish now. I was getting a weird floating film of pale yellow mucus in the toilet too when i pooped but since eating my stool has been more darker yellow. Please help :( (also a pink patch has appeared on my tongue a few months ago which i heard is vitamin deficiency is this anything to donwith it? I sound crazy)

Diagnoses: thalassemia minor, anemia, gender dysphoria, depression

Medications: Zoloft (100mg OD for depression), Letrozole (just for 5 days post retrieval). Was previously taking Gonal F, Menopur, and Cetrotide per ovarian stimulation protocols, and was triggered with Lupron.

I underwent a course of ovarian stimulation to have my eggs retrieved and frozen prior to starting masculinizing gender transition. This culminated with an egg retrieval yesterday morning. Throughout the stimulation process I produced 15+ follicles on each ovary and my estrogen was apparently ""extremely high,"" although come extraction time they only got 12 mature eggs.

After the retrieval (for which I got Ativan, Versed, and fentanyl for sedation, Gravol for nausea prevention, and some antibiotic I don't remember the name of), I was given the standard warnings about cramping, the possibility of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, remaining bloating until my next period, etc. and was sent home with Letrozole and instructions to consume ample water, fibre, and electrolytes while using Tylenol PRN for pain.

Since yesterday, I am having steadily-increasing lower abdominal pain not relieved by the maximum recommended dose of Tylenol, rebound tenderness of the lower abdomen, and increased pain and tenderness upon standing up or stretching out in a supine position. The extent of this pain is such that I have difficulty walking and standing up straight; and cannot laugh, sneeze, or travel over speed bumps in a vehicle without significant pain and guarding. I also have some internal pain that feels like it's localized around my vagina/cervix (but that's probably just from the needle used in the retrieval).

I weighed myself on the morning of the retrieval with an empty stomach and bladder and clocked in at 152.8lbs. I weighed myself this evening on an empty bladder after consuming small meals today and weighed 157.0lbs. I also measured my abdominal circumference and found it to be 34.5in - IIRC my usual is around 31in, but I don't remember exactly.

I have noted, at different times over the past 36 hours, a few different types of vaginal discharge post-retrieval; some clear to off-white and streaked with blood, some yellowish, and some bright orange.

I feel some faintness upon sitting or standing up, but I am anemic and this is not unusual for me when I am convalescent.

I have an oral temperature of 99.4F and don't feel any particular malaise or fever. My resting heart rate is 88bpm, strong, and regular. My mental status is unremarkable.

"Bronchitis not improving treatment. Should I wait it out, or go see my doctor?32F, 5'7"", 228, no other health issues or daily medications

On Monday I went to the virtual clinic at my work and was diagnosed with viral bronchitis. It was only two days after my symptoms began, but because I have a history of bronchitis, I was hoping that early intervention would take care of it. I did not have a cold or anything prior to the tightness in my lungs and cough developing. They did not do a chest x-ray, but based on my description and cough, they prescribed and inhaler and sent me home since I had a fever. Since then, I have been treating it with the inhaler and ibuprofen to reduce my fever, but my cough has gotten significantly worse (which was expected) and the fever returns daily.

Typically, my PCP prescribes a steroid and expectorant, and even though my cough lasts for several weeks, I usually start feeling better after a couple of days and can still function at work. With my current symptoms, I feel worse each day. The doctor I saw at the virtual clinic did not want to prescribe the steroid because I just got my flu shot the Friday before my symptoms began, and she was hoping the inhaler would keep the bronchitis from getting worse.

And most likely unrelated, but naturally is fueling my paranoia, one of my coworkers that I work closely with was hospitalized yesterday with pneumonia. His symptoms began around the same time that mine did, but were more severe than mine.

My current symptoms are as follows:

* Severe cough (sometimes producing yellow mucus)
* Low grade fever (typically between 100 and 102)
* Chills
* Shortness of breath (I am having trouble talking without taking a breath in the middle of words)
* Chest tightness/lungs feel irritated
* wheezing
* Weakness/no energy
* Feeling lightheaded 
* Trouble focusing
* Nausea 
* No appetite
* No voice from coughing so much

I'm unsure of whether or not the impact of the walking has caused the separation, or the damage done in my teens by my stepfather putting me in the hospital by kicking me in the side with boots on, and I doubt it's relevant to the damage I've already incurred.

It is definitely causing harm, but I don't have the money nor the time to get to the doctor without bankrupting myself and my wife.

How long do I have before it's 100% necessary to get to someone to fix this? I'm a couple hundred dollars away, give or take, before I'd be totally bankrupt and homeless, so going in anytime soon to get checked out is unlikely, although I would like a general timeframe before I inevitably wear away the skin and puncture my chest.

TL:DR - 10th rib (false) separated from Costal Cartilage, currently pressed tightly against my chest skin on the left side, curved up and underneath my 9th rib at 35 degrees upward. I walk 28 miles per day for work, frequently lifting up to 75lbs unassisted. How long before this thing pops out of my skin into open air?",AskDocs,t3_dk6tgd

Will I become tall? I appreciate any helpI’m just really curious and I hope I can find some insight here. I am 15m and 5’9. My dad is 6’6-6’7 and my mom is 5’10-5’11. I have not started puberty in any way and have not had a growth spurt yet. In 4th grade I was 5’2 so that’s pretty tall but now I’m only 5’9. My BMI is underweight because I still have small bone mass like a young child. Logically I feel like I should be the same height if not taller than my dad because this is me before puberty and since I literally have not started puberty I should have around another foot to grow right?

**Symptoms**

I've been having some issues recently. 


- Lots of diarrhea at night.


Recently when I drink lots of water after dinner I end up on the toilet passing most of the water I drank. When I wipe the toilet paper is yellow. 


The rest of the day before dinner I'm drinking plenty of water and everything is just fine. 


The diarrhea can last a few hours. It's usually triggered when I eat a lot of food and drink water. I don't eat until dinner time (5pm-11pm) so I do eat a lot in a small window. 


- Not passing as much stool daily/urge to use bathroom greatly lowered.


Before the diarrhea happened I noticed that I wasn't using the bathroom much for 2 days. Usually, I have to go an hour after I wake up and it's really strong. But the urge is greatly reduced and if I try to hold off for a bit then I might just not use the bathroom that day. If I do go, it's very little compared to usual. Like 1/5th even though I track my nutrition and am eating the same foods and calories as usual. 




- Day before yesterday I woke up laying on my stomach with stomach pain in the top of my stomach and salivating with the strong urge to vomit. Ran to the sink, could not vomit. Pain and issues went away after about 10-15min. I haven't had it since then. 


- No diarrhea day before yesterday.  Yesterday though I didn't use the bathroom. Had a little urge to but was very busy and then the feeling went away. 


- Today I passed a single solid stool but it was very light colored and [green/yellowish](https://i.imgur.com/oFsMStZ.png). Small amount. Probably 6 inches which is weird because I didn't use the bathroom yesterday. I used the dropper tool in MSpaint for the color in the pic above so it's from my stool. Did so because I know might find it gross seeing the real picture. 


[Picture of stool](https://i.imgur.com/sonraYu.png)




I do not eat anything green. 


**Other symptoms:**


- Throat feels a little irritated like I've been yelling

- Woke up today with my left nostril clogged but that is gone

**Diet**

I'm very broke right now so my only food for the past month has been


- Homemade bread 

400-440g of flour, 8g instant yeast, 15-20g olive oil in the mix, 15g of butter/olive oil mixed with garlic salt on the top, baked at 500f for 12-15min. 




- Grilled chicken. 

24oz of chicken tenders + seasoned salt (which is red in color from paprika), + a quick coating of nonstick butter flavored spray. Grilled at 375-400F for 12min each side


- Generic dollar store Multi-Vitamin which I've taken every day this month without issue. 

- I do use a low calorie butter on the bread and it has betacarotene but it's only 15-20g of that butter. 

- Eating around 2500-2600 calories a day because I'm active.

Complaint: Upper right abdominal pain

Medical history: Ashtma, anxiety, celiac disease.

Medication: Citalopram 40mg, salbutamol inhaler, fluticasone inhaler, omeprezole 20mg. 

No smoking, drinking or recreational drugs.

&amp;#x200B;

We are currently at our wits end with what to do about this constant pain my girlfriend is in. 

It all started at the beginning of September when we came back from holiday. She was complaining of flank pain, but she could walk around well enough unassisted. We ended up self-refering to the emergency department when the pain became too much. They eventually diagnosed it as a kidney infection with blood tests and an ultrasound. She was let out of hospital after a few days and given a course of antibiotics for 2 weeks.

The pain persisted and we were eventually forced to go back to hospital because of the unbearable pain, blood tests, a chest xray and abdominal xray showed nothing untoward so we were sent back home with painkillers. 

3rd trip to the hospital but this time, the pain was shooting to the front right side and as of that day, it has been the main area of pain. A blood test showed slight changes in LFT and the area of pain was the gallbladder area. We suspected gallstones as two people in her immediate family have had this issue before, but this time she had a CT scan and another X-ray on her abdomen; again with clear results. The doctor refered her for an MRCP and ultrasound scan to have a more detailed look in that area. 

Ultrasound scan was fine.

The day before her MRCP scan, she had an endoscopy to investigate potiental celiac disease, this has been causing a lot of discomfort too, bloating, tiredness etc. This is all but confirmed since having blood tests that showed high TTG levels. we are still waiting on results on that, but test restults from that showed erosive gastritis and non-erosive duodenitis. But the consultant told her its very likely that the pain she is experiencing is from something else, not celiac disease. 

4th trip to hospital was very recently when she was in a lot of pain, bloods were fine, urine was fine and the practioner said her MRCP results came back fine: no gallstones, no problems to be seen.

We dont know where to go from here, we have an appoitnment with a celiac nurse who can hopefully help us, but is this a by-product of her body adapting to a gluten free life? 

She has been under another consultant for chronic constipation for a while aswell, she is missing the first year of her university course which she is devasted about, but we are hoping the change in diet will help with this pain.

She cannot sit up for long periods of time. Half the time she cannot even go to the toilet unassissted because of this constant pain she is in. 

Any insight would be great!

Tuesday morning: Woke up to worrying pain. Could barely walk to the bathroom initially. Pain occurred when I pushed off my toes in my stride. Noticed tenderness on the outside of my ankles (In the area that a peroneal tendonitis graph would indicate) on both feet. After icing, was able to walk with some tenderness. Was able to complete 30 minutes of medium eliptical machine, noticed slight pain towards the end of session. Feet felt better during exercise and the remainder of the day after, but definitely injured in some way. Completely ceased running.

Wednesday-Friday: Spent these days doing RICE, hot tub jets on the ankles, rehab stretches I found online, heat, and only non weight bearing cardio like eliptical and bike + weights. Able to complete these without pain at this point. Only slight tenderness upon waking, which went away after walking around a bit and warming up in my weight lifting. Each morning my feet felt progressively better. Felt as if the injury is healing.

Today: Was raining this morning, so without thinking did a light jog to get to my car. Unable to run at all without feeling pain. Running completely out of the question. Walking still feels okay for the most part with only slight tenderness (which I assume was exacerbated by the running.)

I'm encouraged by the progress I've made in a couple of days, but the pain associated with a light jog this morning was unsettling. I have an appointment next Thursday but I'm really upset and was looking for some initial insight.",AskDocs,t3_dk4yua

"Is this worth mentioning to my neurologist?I am 28 female, 128lbs 5'4 Caucasian, US and have a possible neck or balance issue for a few weeks. 
I take 2000 vitamin D , Zyrtec and gabapentin 600mg at night only. Smoke but since diagnosis cut down significantly with intention to quit. I had feberal seizures till i was four or five and was tested for epilepsy as I had over 15 but it was negative then. I was dx with highly active rrms this past summer with seven active lesions in July in my brain and one in my spine. Since then I had a new relapse September or last two days of August that effected my thinking /speach and vision of moving objects. 


It took only three weeks for the majority of those symptoms to subside and I had a Ms neuro appointment that was more involved than the last neuro. At that appointment I was told where my weaknesses were and now I'm having more slowly increasing problems and already will be bringing up my slurring of words and how I keep dropping items or fumbling holding pens in my hand but I noticed something odd and I cannot figure out if it's something to bring up or not since I didn't bring up one of my first symptoms from last October that this neuro stares sounded like a seizure.

When I work we have stone dental models we groom and trim and for almost 3years I have done this no problem but now in the last few weeks I find myself with my head slightly forward and far to the side really awkwardly. First time it happened I blew it off. But it is happening daily I only notice when I've been in that position for some time. when I had the possible seizure it was at work and it was like deja Vu and my hearing was muted and I was listening to my manager and myself through a old frosted TV screen. And it's hard to remember the before and after of it. Well i don't remember turning my head and neck and it's kind of like odd feeling when I do finally notice.. 

Is this something I need to mention or maybe it's just work fatigue. Since being back to work I only take on one task instead of eight and I started adding in trimming models because I do not want to jeapordize my job only having one function. But maybe it's too much to jump back into and my body is just getting tired from it?

Edit to add I'm getting an EEG this week. My coworker noticed I'm staring blankely throughout the day when I'm on the computer processing cases but I honestly feel other than when I trim that I'm all there.

"HelpCurrently I’ve been feeling very terrible. Constant bloating, foul smelling gas, indigestion and diarrhea. I’ve also lost about 10 pounds. My problems started in the begging of the year with just loose stools and diarrhea. One day I woke up in excruciating pain so I went to the bathroom and heard something snap inside of me. Seconds later blood starts pouring down from my bottom filling up the toilet. About a month later I had a colonoscopy and everything came out clean. NO SIGNS OF ANYTHING, during May Is when the indigestion started and it’s gotten worse to the point where anything I eat I get bloated, start passing gas and burping a lot. June comes and I start seeing my urine bubble no big deal. I then have a 24 hour urine test and it says I have albuminuria but the doctors aren’t worried because it’s only 90mg a day. I had an endoscopy last month and nothing was spotted but my symptoms keep persisting. I had stool test done which came out negative for parasites or H. Pylori. I’ve been a daily smoker for 6 years already and I’m fearing I have stomach cancer since about 50% of people diagnosed were smokers. Excreting low levels of protein in urine is common with stomach cancer as I’ve done my research it’s called a neoplastic disease. My stomach keeps making noises throughout the day which isn’t normal either. I’ve gone to my doctors dozens of times and they are tired of me and won’t help or send me to a new GI.

"Some sort of come-and-go rash?Hey there,

Not in any dire pain, but I’ve had this itchiness that’s been come and go for the past month or so. It flares up and then looks like the pics attached ... lighter colored marks with a red outline. Nothing scabs over or anything like that, nor are there any little holes that would suggest some type of bug bite. It’s generally been hands/arms/feet, but scalp has been itchy and now seeing it on my shoulders.

Here’s my stats:
Age: 36
Gender: male 
Height: 6’7”
Weight: 235
Medications (prescribed): finasteride and omeprazole
Medications/supplements (non-prescription): biotin, psyllium caplets, allergy med (cetirizine HCl 10mg)

That shoulder pic is this morning, and that’s on top of a super swollen knot (assumingly unrelated) that I gave some hell to yesterday, but then woke up with it itchy and covered in similar marks to what I’ve been seeing elsewhere.

I went to the Walgreens clinic last week when my hands and arms (similar to other pics) were particularly itchy during the workday, but once I arrived around 6:30 all the marks had faded and she asked about new soaps etc., said it seemed like nothing ,and then told me to start taking an allergy pill.

I’ve been taking the allergy pill and that’s mitigated most of this but it’s still been popping up occasionally. That there are distinct and consistent-looking marks is what makes me so curious.

Any clue what this might be?

I’ve got a PCP and all, but given the Walgreens nurse sorta waved it off figured it truly may be nothing problematic, but given its still come and go, thought I’d throw it out here. 

Thanks for any insights!

About a half hour ago, my partner got home from work. He said ""Hi"" and I asked him how his day was but had difficulty understanding his answer - I initially thought he wasn't enunciating or something because I just seemed to not be able to understand. I told him I didn't really understand and then when I started talking, we realized that nothing that I was saying seemed to be making any sense - like instead of saying ""I don't understand what you're saying"" I would say something apparently like ""I uh nee uh under wuh"" - my boyfriend says there was some mouth struggle going on. I knew what I wanted to say but could tell it wasn't coming out right. I got concerned and thought maybe I should try writing but I had a hard time even holding the pencil and the note I wrote (trying to say something like  ""I don't know why I can't talk to you - I'm trying to talk normally"" I wrote out as ""that I hasn't that don't that don't that on't of ohto"" - I remember now looking at the ""on't"" that I wrote down, thinking to myself - ""is that a word? I feel like that might be a word or might not"". By this time I could understand my partner talking but still couldn't talk to him, he was saying we should go to a doctor so I went to our bedroom to get some socks and change, and then magically I started talking normally again. We didn't continue with our plan to go to the emergency room because it didn't seem like it was an emergency anymore. And now I'm here writing this.  

&amp;#x200B;

We live in Canada and recently moved to Nova Scotia so although we have insurance, I don't have a local family doctor where we live, although I did have one back in Toronto. I definitely feel like this is concerning enough to see a professional but I'm unclear on how serious this is - should we go to emergency? a walk-in clinic? did I have a stroke? Would love any and all feedback or info.  In addition, (including just to be complete or in the off chance that there is some sort of relationship here) yesterday morning so like 36 hours ago) I woke up at 5am because of a very odd feeling in my throat and chest - it was painful and felt like pressure or sortof like I had something stuck in my throat or needed to burp but burping didn't help and it lasted for most of the day, but slowly got better, until nightfall when it was gone. It seems unlikely to be related but I just wanted since that was also a weird slightly alarming feeling medical event that I had never experienced before and having two of those within 48 hours seems surprising. 

&amp;#x200B;

  
\*I put the duration as 15 minutes, but technically I hadn't spoken aloud in several hours because I had been home alone, although I had sent several messages/emails successfully. So for all I know, I might have been unable to talk for a period of time previously?


&amp;#x200B;

  Update: was too tired to give all of you an update last night but in emerg they had blood work, urine samples, an EKG and a CT scan done. They all came back normal, so they felt it was unlikely that I had had a mini stroke (I don't smoke or have family history).  While waiting in emerg (about 3 hours after the incident) I had developed a pretty bad headache, so their likely diagnosis was that it was an ""aura"" from a migraine - my index case since this had never happened before. I'm a little surprised by this - I never normally get headaches and when I did get his one I didn't have light sensitivity of any of the typical migraine stuff. So now I basically just supposed to not start smoking or taking birth control and hope that it doesn't happen again. Still a little concerned that it could have been a mini stroke because I also had this weird chest symptoms before and I know women often present differently for heart attacks than men.

"Chronic groin pains before and after inguinal hernia surgeryHi everyone, I've been dealing with chronic pain for 6 years and I desperately need a second opinion. Thank you ahead of time for reading this, it's a tad long but I truly am in need of help.

At 16, I started having pains in my groin area. A doctor assumed it was epididymitis and gave me meds, the meds relieved the pain while taking them but the pain immediately came back once I ran out. I then saw a urologist who took an ultrasound, saw nothing, and dismissed it as teenage blue balls (it wasn't that). At this point I dropped it out of embarrassment in front of my parents and just dealt with the pain for years.

At 20, I have was still dealing with the pain. I started taking propecia for early male pattern baldness (runs in the family, my dad takes propecia too). I still take it to this day and it brought my hair back in full. This is likely unrelated but propecia is sometimes attributed to groin pain or a loss of libido (read on).

At 22, in spring 2019, the consistent pain starts getting a tad worse. It goes from a 2/10 to a 4/10. I see a urologist who takes an ultrasound and sees nothing. She recommendeds I wear tight briefs and take aleve every day. A couple months later the pain gets unbearably bad, I'm stuck on the bed in pain and unable to sleep. 7/10 to 9/10 pain. I realize while I, historically, thought the pain was coming from my right testicle due to the first doctor claiming it was epididymitis, the pain was actually more north of my scrotum and in my groin (unless it's two independent sources of pain which I'm now considering in present day..). I look online and diagnose myself with an inguinal hernia. I see a specialist, they do an ultrasound, and confirm its a hernia. I have my operation to fix it July 2019. Hurray! Finally an end to 6 years of chronic pain..or so I hoped.

Recovery from the open surgery was extremely rough and the right part of my scrotum got comically large and in pain. assumed it was a hydrocele and asked the surgeon 4 weeks post surgery to look at it but he said it wasn't necessary. In September, I realized the size of my right testicle is nearly 3x that of my left one (not normal, its usually only like 1.25 or 1.5x bigger), and if I press into my groin, what I assume is the spermatic cord feels very inflammed and hard. I went to my surgeon but he dismissed it saying to check back in January

To this day, my right groin is still in notable pain and my right testicle very oversized, and I don't know if it's due to expected recovery, unexpected complications from the surgery, or maybe the pain I've been experiencing all these years was unrelated to my hernia.

Due to the rough recovery and pain, ive gained probably 15 pounds these past couple months, my libido has gone to literally zero, and I'm suffering from secondary premature ejaculation for the times my wife can convince me to have sex. I don't know if this is due to propecia, a lack of confidence due to weight gain (I'm very self conscious about my body, hence why I'm taking meds for my hair), or just the constant pain making it impossible for me to enjoy sex.

I'm taking 2-4 aleves a day to mitigate the pain but it's still there at a small level (2/10) with that and it's starting to get to my head. If I don't take the Aleve the pain is around 4 or 5 out of 10. Probably the same level as when I saw the urologist early spring. Not as bad as days before the surgery.

Is this pain and a massively swollen testicle normal 3 months after surgery? Could propecia be taking a play in my libido? It wasn't doing anything for years before the surgery but now I'm second guessing myself. Between the pain and no libido I've been miserable and the chronic pain with no relief has finally mentally destroyed me.

First of all, I just have to get this out. This is all frustrating because I just feel like I'm not getting a lot of help from doctor visits. I mean I have gotten some help but I'm always concerned I might have something like diabetes and the issue just hasn't been pressed hard enough. However, I have expressed my concerns about things like: liver problems, diabetes, problems with my urine, etc and my GP does not seem to think those paths merit more investigation. To be fair, all but one of my blood tests recently have been normal and it only showed high triglycerides(which was like shit... what ELSE do I need to cut out of my diet?!?!?)

OK, second of all, some questions may pop up in your head like ""why didn't you do X or Y or Z?"". The simple answer is... you guessed it. I'm a dumbass. I would really like to just skip that sort of questioning and just try to figure out what can be done moving forward if possible. 

**Prior history:** Here are some medical problems I had been diagnosed with before I started having all these problems

1. exercise induced asthma 10-12y/o or less? But actuality I had asthma/breathing problems more often than just when I exercised.
2. Seasonal allergies
3. Vision - mildly nearsighted, I think I had floaters at the time and I still do. 
4. I had a non-acne skin rash on my face, over my nose and some of my cheeks that lasted a long time. I can't recall how old I was at the time but I think I was in middle school or early high school. 
5. Maybe? lactose intolerant. 

**Part 1**
I had my wisdom teeth removed about 10 years ago... I had some issues with them my gums got red and swollen around them and I think may have been some pus but I can't remember that long ago. ... should have had them taken out a lot sooner. I was also having a rapid heart rate at the time and some chest pain. I went to the doctor and they ran a whole bunch of tests. I had my wisdom teeth taken out, and all the problems went away after a while and I was good for about 2 months?? or maybe a bit longer than that. 

**Part 2**
Then I ate some red beans and rice one day and it gave me TONS of gas. Now normally... sometimes I would get gas and sometimes I wouldn't but this was not normal bean gas. This was a LOT of gas. The gas didn't go away, and every time I was eating I was getting lots of gas. Eventually I found out that not eating carbs stopped the gas. Things got worse. maybe a month or so after the gas started I had a new problem, I was having problems having bowel movements. It wasn't that I had a hard stool that just wouldn't come out. When I have hard stool, it usually comes out but it's in pellets or is just rocky and falls apart.

Some notes about this: 

1. Lasts more than a few days. I don't know how long it went for sure. Sometimes I think it felt like 2 weeks but that doesn't seem possible, although when this would happen, sometimes I would eat less.
2. usually not painful, but uncomfortable because of I assume the bloating and gas. 
3. I know I am having the problem when my gut starts making this clicking sound. I will have maybe 1 or 2? more OK BMs and then further attempts are not completely void but not very fruitful either.
4. I know it may not sound that bad just looking at the text, but it was BAD. and I know what you're thinking, you know if you aren't pooping well it may take a few days but it will come. one time I did that. I waited. I waited. I will poop yeah. wait wait wait. Until one day I'm sitting there thinking ""ok, I'll drink some grape juice cause thats the type of thing that makes you poop"" so I did, and I vomited(no poop as far as I could tell), it really sucked, and I did not poop. 

After some time of just waiting for this stuff to go away eventually I went back to my doctor and eventually to a GI specialist. So in the timeline, this is about a year after I had my initial problems, maybe a little longer than that. I had an endoscopy where I was tested for celiac(family history) and not a colonoscopy but a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Celiac was negative. I was diagnosed with EoE and IBS. I was prescribed singulair but didn't take it because at the time it was expensive, I was poor, and the EoE did not seem like that big of a deal to just deal with. Also before that procedure they had me do a fecal occult test which came up negative. 

**The long mass of time afterwards**
This is a list of all of the problems I recall having after the GI visit, after which I kind of gave up for a very long time. Partially because I just didn't have a lot of money, and partially because I was just tired. Really, I just don't have much fight in me even now.

**In ""as I think of it"" order**

I had tingling in my hands and feet for a brief period early on, then it went away. 

Muscle twitches. Seems to be induced by certain foods but also happens when I'm otherwise not feeling well. I have had numbness in my:face, parts of my hands. Noteworthy is that I banged the top of my left thumb... scraped it. Took forever to heal the scrape. Finger got numb. Eventually went away. 

conjunctivitis???? I think. 

stars in my eyes that seems to happen too easily

tonsil stones

gums crack in the back of my mouth where my wisdom teeth were. 

drained of energy sometimes that seems to revolve around eating. 

My face gets oily sometimes when I eat ""bad"" 

This hasn't happened in a while but I would have a couple different types of spells

1. It has been a long time since it has happened, but this happened a couple of times. Basically I thought I was having a heart attack, although iirc I did not have what is frequently seen as a sign of a heart attack coming. It was more like... in one moment I feel fine, then over 5-10 minutes? maybe a bit longer? things are really shitty. this would persist for a little while and then pass, and once again, iirc, I would feel pretty normal(for me) afterwards.

2. I will wake up in the middle of the night. WIDE AWAKE. I know something is wrong, its accompanied with nausea and chill that slowly build up and get worse, and it may just be my personality but anxiety(because I'm kind of anxious anyway). The chilliness and nausea will go away eventually but I seem to never fall back asleep when this  happens. Usually it has happened while sleeping but I think it may have happened before when I wasn't sleeping too. I have also had the 'waking up' without the nausea and chilly feeling. This might happen 2 or 3 times a year, but hasn't happened in a long time. 

A problem with my tongue that looks similar to photos online of geographic tongue. it's come and go.

more typical hard stool - sometimes I would have stools with fine wrinkles in them in addition to the bigger chunkier folds I see sometimes.

I have had small white??? dots in my stool, and small dark dots. But I have also had undigested food other than corn, too. 

I did not and still don't really get diarrhea very easily, but maybe that's because I try to eat a good amount of fiber. I get slushy stool, furry stools, I have had what was probably mucus in my stool. I have had oddly shaped stools and thin stools, green stools, multicolored stools... dark stools(but not the black and tarry ones) very light colored stools... undigested food in my stool(aside from corn, green vegetables, green/red pepper, tomato, maybe quinoa, rice(brown rice?) ) 

I think I have had almost every bad stool under the sun at at least some point.

belly button pain

pain in various parts of my abdomen. 

Difficulties with breathing, it was kind of like the asthma I would have but not quite as bad, lasted a while... at least several days but I seem to recall this was a drawn out issue that happened more than once, but I know it happened at least once. I have also had breathing that was just... short. Not difficult just less volume.  This is opposed to the asthma that I had when I was younger which was episodic. 

Sometime in the midst of all of this I had vaccinations. On my way home I had to pull over because I started feeling REALLY bad. Basically I felt chilly and just very, very shitty for... some period of time. It was easily less than 30 minutes, probably more like 10 minutes or less but it was a long time ago and can't remember clearly. More recently I had shots to get some teeth filled. First time they were like ""next time we will give you the shot without epi in it"" so they did and I STILL felt shitty. But I think this may have been different. I don't recall feeling nauseated when I had the vaccines but I did when getting the anesthetic shots. 

foamy urine that IMO is way foamier than I ever experienced when I was younger, and it is sort of come and go. Also sometimes(not usually) it seems like it gets dark and yellow too easily despite the amount of water I drink. I have brought this up with my doc and he doesn't seem concerned because my urine test was OK. Since I had allergy tests done and cut out those foods I don't have this problem as much but it still happens, especially if I eat too many carbs. Since we're talking about urine sometimes it has a smell. The best way I can think to describe it is some odd plastic smell. But I'm afraid that might be misleading because I wish I had a BETTER way to describe the way it smells. But really, most time we shouldn't even be able to smell our own urine right? I mean, yeah if you get right up on it or let it sit around you'll smell it but I mean I can smell it while I'm relieving myself. 

I have had periods where I thought I bruised easily, or had bruises that would show up and couldn't be explained from any injury. These are light bruises and not very dark.  

Pain in my left nut(both nuts?) which came and went away and I totally forgot till recently because apparently it left a shadow behind and I'm noticing some mild discomfort. Actually, there seems to be a lot of ""shadowy"" stuff where I'll have a pronounced problem, then it comes back later with mild discomfort.

while we're on the subject of sex organs, at one point I had an issue were my penis went crooked on me and seemed blown up, or had blown up veins. I don't seem to recall that it was painful. It happened again later but wasn't that bad, and has not happened in a long time now. 

and while we're talking about blood vessels and veins.... the blood vessels on my legs decided to blow up at some point. I never had prominent veins on my legs but now I do... and its been a while but I seem to recall that they got big when I was having really bad gut problems. I also have a similarly bulging vein on my forehead that also is new within the past couple of years or so. And maybe one on my left arm. But I am not so sure about that one, maybe it's just normal, but I seem to recall having some pain from it. I don't think about that one as much because it's not as noticeable, but there is a clear difference between my left and right arm.  

I remember checking my blood pressure and pulse a few times throughout the years, and until recently it was not good. generally speaking, the top number was usually 130-160(I can't remember the lower numbers as well but they were not impressive) and pulse was in the 80's when I was calm. Now it is in the low 100-110's for the top number usually(although one time it was 130 ish) and pulse is more what I would expect in the 60-70 range. I also recall that my heart rate did not want to settle down. For instance, when I would exert myself it would take a long time for my heart rate to come back down to normal. If it is still a problem it is not enough for me to take much notice of it like it was in the past.

Ashy elbows which went away when I changed something in my diet and have not come back. I can't remember what I changed, it was a long time ago.

this rash that, if untreated, breaks out when I: exercise, eat something that gives me problems, get anxious/nervous, or shower. Its a splotchy, itchy red rash mostly around my face, neck, arms, chest, and hairline.
currently I take cetirizine, or levocetirizine and it does a pretty good job taking care of it. 

Bumps that break out on my hands. They look like mini warts and are grouped. They are different from the exercise rash. These stick around for several days or longer, until I fix whatever I ate that seems to be causing it(because it seems to be attached to diet) Usually break out on the edges of my fingers or wrists. However, one time both of the palms of my hands broke out in these things and it was pretty bad. Usually they don't get red but they can if it gets bad. Also usually results in some skin peeling/flaking. Keeping my diet under control keeps this at bay. 

A patch on my back that has been there for a couple years now. It started small and grew. My doctor gave me some cream for it (triamcinolone acetonide) It gets red and itchy - the cream stops that for a while but it never fully goes away. My skin is dark in this area and the darkness is unaffected by the cream. The spot on my back also seems affected by what I eat. 

Pain under my underarms which... my doctor doesn't seem to be all that concerned about. It's come and go and what I would say is usually uncomfortable but not painful, however it has been painful in the past.
 
tinnitus(maybe I had this when I was younger but can't remember. I have a high pitched tinnitus most of the time even now. If my problems get bad I get this low pitch, throbbing tinnitus??? maybe it's not tinnitus.

speaking of my ears, sometimes my ears will get hot/sore/itchy and start pumping out the wax. Mostly my right ear but sometimes my left ear too, or even my left ear and not my right ear. Sometimes seems to go down into my throat. 

on/off problems with these foods, which did not show up on my recent allergy test:
cinnamon, pineapple, cashews(VERY bad because it makes my anus and mouth blow up and itch for DAYS. shitting is painful. Talking is painful and makes the corners of my mouth bleed. I don't eat cashews now. ever.), canned tuna(I have not tried frozen tuna but other fishes seem OK), carbs in general give me gas and irritation? sometimes but I have many days where non-allergic carbs are not problematic. These 3 foods in particular give me problems that others do not. So basically like I described with the cashews, but not as frequent or as bad with the cinnamon and pineapple. Strangely, the foods I was diagnosed as being allergic to have never given me these problems but I do feel better after cutting them out, but still fighting issues.

in the middle of all of this, I did have a period of about a year or maybe 2 were I seemed to have few to no issues.

**So what are my current ongoing issues?**

a lot of the problems described above seem to have abated some with diet control(cutting out the allergic foods and not eating too many carbs) and exercise. Either that, or they just went away and I didn't see them again(like the eye redness. That carried on for a while then just quit)

When I was diagnosed with chronic gastritis I was given protonix for 30 days. It may have helped a little while I was taking it but the effects seem to have been short lived. At some earlier point in time I tried prilosec for 2 weeks, which seemed to be more powerful but actually seemed to make things worse after a certain point. I have tried pepcid - actually the story behind that is interesting. 

I took pepcid for a while because it seemed to help with stomach grumbling and problems I had at night - because when I would lay down to sleep it would give me stomach problems and such which are probably related to the chronic gastritis. It's not as much of a problem now but I've also elevated the head of my bed. I would say pepcid may have been more effective but if I kept taking it I would get backlash when I quit taking it, so I tried not to take it too long. However, I am suspicious that I may have started having issues with all the tingling when I was taking both pepcid and a probiotic - in hindsight I think that was a mistake. I've cut out all the probiotics now. But like I said before I'm an idiot. However later at some point I took pepcid again without the probiotic and it seemed to make the tingling worse. But I also tried it again other times it's also seemed to make it better. Really, I'm at a loss. It could just be that whatever reason I felt I needed to take the 2 things is what caused all the tingling and pain. I really don't know, it's been too long. 

I get tingling and not too frequently pain when I lay down in bed. It's worse at night. Well, that's how it started anyway. It started really REALLY bad, almost completely went away, then came back. It was so bad that I could not stay horizontal to sleep, it was too painful. At one point I had tingling over my whole body. Currently it is not so bad and is more like background noise, but it does it when I am sitting down now too. Moving around and standing seem to help or stop it. This is the problem that concerns me most at the moment. 

I did not really start having joint pain until this year or so. This is since I cut out the foods I was found to be allergic to. So I was doing some regular gaming, but not so much that you would think it should be problematic. It was just like... not really suddenly but... ramping up quickly I had pain in my hands. Then I quit the games for a while and it got better. Started gaming again and didn't have issues for a long time. But since I have quit gaming(I quit because I got busy with other stuff). I would have resumed when busy times went away but I started having issues with my hands again that seem to not be as bad as the initial problems I had, but the difference is 1. I have the problem despite having not used a controller in a couple months now. I still type but it is not as continuous, although I did take breaks with gaming anyway. The difference is that with gaming, the breaks are needed. With typing, the breaks are natural. 2. I have problems with fingers I don't use much. I also sometimes have pain that goes up to my elbow but it is less frequent. 

at some point recently I was trying to improve the quality of my diet I was drinking low/non lactose milk products like cheese but avoided lactose free ice cream and other stuff like that because it gave me cramps despite being lactose free. At some point I got too lax and started consuming stuff that had lactose in it, which produced an odd result. I didn't get the cramps! so I ate MORE lactose food like real ice cream. First time it gave me some gas but I still had some joy because it didn't give me cramps. I ate it again, and had the same result - no cramps but some late developing gas. I did not connect it at first, and maybe it's not connected. But sometime around that time I was having a new problem. I was getting a strange sharp electric/zap feeling in my right hand. I could grip things and flex my hand and not have problems. But if I so much as lightly brushed the tips of my fingers against my jeans it was electric. I wasn't certain if it was the milk but I was suspicious so I went maybe overboard and cut out all traces of milk product and have not had the zapping since. I am still not 100% certain but I find it suspicious. I am thinking of trying to go back to some no/low lactose milk products again because my diet is just too sparse. Also, this whole episode makes me question the whole lactose intolerance thing. I mean, I think it is possible I have lactose intolerance since it is so common, but I don't think that explains everything and I think I'm missing some things.

I have been jogging lately(several months?). Most days I will feel OK and can jog at a good pace for 40 minutes. On a bad day I jog for a few minutes and I will ache badly, but it will go down a reasonable amount as I jog. I will feel like 20 minutes is too long despite a lowered pace because I just run out of gas a lot faster. Cutting out peanut butter helped with this a good amount(it was almost every day) but I STILL have this problem sometimes. When I run I usually get tingling in my hands/arms towards the end of my run. lifting my arms in the air temporarily makes it go away. waiting makes it go away completely till it comes back for other reasons. 

On bad days I have joint pain regardless of physical activity. It's just not as bad as when I'm running, Mostly the pain is in my legs/feet and hands. As long as I'm not doing anything stressful the pain is mild or more like discomfort.

I still need an answer on why I have had issues with the dental anesthetics. One of my fillings still has a problem and the dentist won't fix it till the cause of my reactions with the anesthetic is explained. I brought it up with my GP but he did not really give me any answers. 

Joint pain and related pain as described above. In my feet/legs and hands.

The urination problems as described.

The exercise rash the skin bumps are mostly under control as long as I take the medicine and control my diet. Still get the itchy feeling in my ears sometimes

the problem with my testicles which is fairly mild and didn't start back up till recently

I still have gas with carbs. it's a lot less than it used to be. Some foods seem worse than others, some days are worse than others. On rare occasions I have had gas from non-carby foods now that I have thought about it more. 

I have brought up diabetes with my GP. My mother is prediabetic and my grandfather(mother's side) is full blown diabetic. Personally I wouldn't really think I would be a good candidate for type 2 diabetes - Generally I eat moderately, I'm not always the best about getting regular exercise but most of my jobs have usually at least involved regularly moving around. Also, if anything I've had issues with being underweight, and typically isn't obesity what's associated with diabetes and not the opposite? My doctor(both of them!) told me I needed to gain weight and to eat more - it is hard. I've only gained like 5lbs over the past year, and that is with effort. But my understanding is that diabetes is one of the most common reasons someone might have neuropathy. So, I don't know. If it's a real possibility and suspect I need to know what to tell my GP to get him interested in exploring that.

Internal hemorrhoids

asthma(??? I was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma when I was young, I think I grew out of it but I have had breathing issues from time to time, but they aren't exercise related and are kind of uncommon. However, I also take steps to prevent such things from happening like avoiding sleeping in carpeted rooms)

anxiety(??? I have been prescribed antidepressants(not currently taking them) by GPs but have not has a diagnosis by a psychiatrist)

Chronic gastritis, some intestinal erosion

Allergies - MANY grass pollen allergies. This has been since I was very young but still confirmed recently. I had a skin prick test done and it was terrible. I can't remember everything off the top of my head. Food allergies are wheat rye sesame pea almonds. 


Current medications
Levocetirizine(or cetirizine if I was too lazy to get a refill)

"Woke up to pain in joints after drinking alcohol?24 year old female, 5ft 100lbs, Asian. I’ve noticed that after even drinking just a small glass of alcohol, I wake up in the middle of the night with joint pain. This has happened almost every time I’ve drank recently, but years ago did not ever happen. The pain varies in location, but is either mostly in my knees or in my hands and elbows; never elsewhere. However, the pain hurts so much that it would make me up in the middle of the night, and I’d say it is about a 7/10 in terms of severity. I drank at around 11pm and the pain woke me up at 5am. My joints only hurt a couple hours later, never in the moment of drinking. Before going to sleep, I chugged a lot of water to make sure I did not go to sleep dehydrated. I took Advil and an hour has passed... and the pain seems to have went away. Usually I would just try to sleep through it and by the morning, the pain would have subsided for the most part.

I got glasses with power -1.5 for left eye and 0.75 for right. Initially it was fine. But month after that i  was made to sit in the front benches and didn't need it. So i stopped wearing it.

**Location:** Left side of face

**Duration:** Unclear. I noticed the left side of my mouth was droopier than the right a few months ago, and around the same time noticed my left eye moving slower/sometimes appearing lazy. I didn’t make a connection or realize how bad it was until I saw photos which were taken of me recently. My left cheek and brow appear completely slack as well.

**Medication:** None currently. Previously took Topamax 25mg and Wellbutrin 100mg (May-Nov 2018) for Bipolar 1, OCD/anxiety.
- **Perhaps worth noting:** I quit these medications because I began having speech production issues, trouble remembering words, frequent trouble just getting through a sentence without excruciating pauses/blanking out. Seems to have improved somewhat, but not entirely.

**Possibly related symptoms which have worsened/increased in frequency since December 2018:**
- Raynaud’s (lifelong)
- dizziness, and temporary loss of vision during dizzy spells
- frequent tingling and loss of sensation in limbs
- extreme fatigue, “falling asleep” standing up at work and while driving (although it’s more like my brain just shuts off, like pressing the remote to turn off your television)

**Other possibly related symptoms:**
- Seizures (Grand Mal in July 2011, cause unknown; Another seizure in June 2018 while donating plasma)
- I am not diagnosed with a seizure condition, although I did not receive proper medical attention for either seizure.

I do not drink, smoke tobacco, or use recreational drugs. I am a full-time student and work 60 hours/week (although I just took a new job to cut my work hours back in hopes it would diminish symptoms).

I don’t think the droopiness is *quite* as noticeable while my face is animated, though the mouth droopiness seems somewhat pronounced to me, and mouth even seems slightly noticeable when I talk/animate, as I’ve noticed it in candid videos.

"Persistent dyshidrotic eczema has been on my hands for over a year and won’t clear up. Feel like I’ve tried everything. Could a diet change fix it?Gender: Female, Age: 24, Height: 5’4”, Weight: 8.5 stone. 

Because I feel like it could possibly have a relevance, I’ll share some stuff about the way I eat. My diet is neither great nor horrible. I’ve been vegan for almost 6 years and generally eat the same as I did before but with meat replacements, most meals have a pasta or rice, some sort of high protein “chicken” or “sausage” and a pile of veg. Usually have a banana or some berries in the morning. I’m pretty good but I do like pasta and I have a meal out with chips(fries) and other unhealthy stuff maybe once a week. I take a multivit &amp; acidophilus every night as I have done my whole life and have had blood tests and I’m not nutrient deficient in anything.

About a year ago I started getting blisters and dryness etc between my fingers on my left hand. It was itchy and I obviously googled it, found out it was probably dyshidrotic eczema but went straight to my GP anyway. He said yes, it’s a type of eczema, probably caused by stress and it will go away. He prescribed some steroid based cream to help with symptoms. About 3 months ago I finally ran out of this cream that had been keeping symptoms minimal(although still present) I didn’t think it was very bad so I didn’t worry about getting more, just moisturised at night.

Well, it’s got much worse. It’s now coating three of my fingers on that hand, and it’s spread onto my palm a bit. The skin around the nail on one of the fingers has swelled up  and the cuticle receded in etc. It looks weird. And it’s developed on one finger on my right hand too. It has a pattern, it blisters, it oozes, it scabs and dries up until the skin cracks open, then the skin peels off and it starts getting “better” then it repeats itself. These pics are from my left hand in the good stage, when it’s dried out, the skin has peeled off and the blisters aren’t present right now, and the other picture is from my right hand that’s in the skin cracking phase. Really sore. It also gets a lot worse when I do a lot of cleaning/have hot baths but I try and wear gloves when I can and it hasn’t fixed the problem.

I've tried staying away from screens, taking melatonin supplements and such but the symptoms just won't go away. Yesterday I couldn't sleep until morning, roughly 6-7 AM, and even then my body refused to sleep, despite how fatigued I was from work and still feeling the symptoms I mentioned above. My body wants to sleep, but my brain just can't.

I work late nights most days, getting home between 9 to midnight. I usually go right for bed but I always end up waking back up in the middle of the night, only to hop on my computer or hit the couch and watch TV till morning. I have tried to break this cycle to no avail. Should I seek a sleep physician? What else can I do?",AskDocs,t3_dk2cmd
"ETD that won’t go awayDemographics: 16 year old male, weigh 51 kg and 5’6 in height 

1 and a half years ago after a flight I got the very annoying cracking and popping in my ears. Mum never took me seriously so it took half a year for her to book a appointment, and the doctor gave me a nasal spray and diagnosed it as ETD. The spray did almost nothing and months later I went again and they just gave me Nasonex actuation Nasal spray. It again didn’t really do anything and a month later when it ran out I went again and the doctor told me she doesn’t know what’s going on and that she’ll talk to her peers and then maybe admit me to a ear canal specialist or something like that. However after 2 weeks she never got back to me as far as I know and I went to the doctors again but got a different one and he just put me back on the spray and told me to chew gum. I’m really lost at this point and I feel like the constant popping and crackling in my ears could affect my study at school and on some days I find it unbearable and others not so bad but I always feel uneasy because I don’t feel 100% healthy. My friends all say that my hearing is bad although I’ve had this for a while so I don’t know if my hearing has gotten worse since I can’t really compare. When I chew some foods I get a different clicking in the right side of my jaw which I’ve read could be TMJ although there is no pain. Is there anything that I can do at this point to get this cured??",AskDocs,t3_dk2bq7

"Help! Can an ER diagnose a potential tooth abscess?Hi there. I’m a 43F. Recent medical history includes back surgery this summer. About a year ago I got a bridge done at the dentist. 6 months later I had to have it replaced due to a misfitting. No real problems before or right after that. Recently started intermittent fasting diet, which I immediately suspected to be the cause of my mouth pain after reading some similar posts about it.  No bad habits such as smoking or drugs.

I’m having some gum pain this week that got markedly worse yesterday. It’s actually in more than one spot but worse around an area with a bridge. It could be sinus, tooth grinding, or a flare up from a recent diet I started (after research). But if it’s an abscess I need to know now. Normal dentist is out of town until Monday and the idea of an emergency dentist that I don’t know sort of freaks me out.

"Fatigue + nocturia – I’m at my wits’ end!34M, 1.80m, 85kg, white. Nonsmoker, drink very rarely, no medication.

Greetings, for the past two years I’ve been suffering ever increasing fatigue + nocturia. With the help of my GP I’ve tested many things, and even she is unsure how to continue. I will first explain the issue as succinctly as I can, then list the tests that have been done. They have all come back negative.

The issue began after a severe panic disorder episode. I don’t think it’s connected, but basically my brain somehow haywire and I spent months in hell becoming suicidal until Clonazepam (Ativan, benzo tranquilizer) saved my life. I used it for a month, then quit by tapering with no side effects and haven’t had a need to touch it since.

Then the fatigue set it. I’m not stressed or overworked, had periods of quitting alcohol, coffee, etc, going to bed early and resting for weeks to no avail. I feel psychologically healthy, no signs of depression so I don’t believe it’s causally psychosomatic, it feels distinctly physical. If I get a good night’s sleep, I feel OK-ish for the first couple of hours, afterwards everything is a struggle and I barely go out in the evenings.

Along with it, nocturia began, I run to the toiler at night 2-5 times, usually in the period between 5 and 9 am. We have done many tests ruling out diabetes and all sorts of urinary problems.

Tests that have been done:

\[BLOOD\]

Very extensive tests with so many variables I can’t list it all here. Basically, all standard tests + things related to potential diabetes, and Vitamin D. Syphilis and chlamydia.

\[URINE\]

One big test with loads of variables that should show if any infection as present.

\[HORMONES\]

Prolactin, somatropin, TSH, AKTH, ACTH.

\[MRI\]

Brain = all fine.

Spine = Spondylitis with some other complications, but vertebrologist told me he sees nothing there that could cause fatigue. However, it did say there is some effect on neural roots, so I plan to have second opinion on that, since I also lately feel a twitching in one eye that has no obvious cause.

I need to figure out what to do next.",AskDocs,t3_dk1o4w

I've been using Cerulyse, but it makes my ear feel sooooo heavy and now on saturday i am wishing time passes quickly to go on monday to the doctor (everything is closed where i live).
2. been a week, i sometimes feel in my right ear (not the left) a kind of heartbeat that lasts for just a few seconds. I felt it maybe 4 times yesterday, each time was less than 1 minute. when? i think when i am sitting and i stand up, or laying in bed and stand up not sure. i don't hear my heartbeat, but it's similar to pulsion sound i guess?

It's like when you are very stressed (but I am not).

Down to the issue. I have had pronounced difficulty sleeping over the last 6 weeks. Every second night, I am totally unable to sleep. I lay there in bed for 4-6 hours and try to sleep, but nothing happens until I give up and get up. I've tried a number of things before attempting to sleep, including hot showers, exercising, and meditation, but nothing is working. It's not like my experience of insomnia, because there are no racing thoughts or anxiety. On the days I do sleep, it's more out of sheer exhaustion, rather than actually feeling sleepy. Sometimes the sedation from the Lurasidone will get me to sleep for an hour or two, but I inevitably wake up and can't get back to sleep.

Hello,

Just like the title says, my period is late by 6 days so far. It's happened before about a year or so ago, but not since. My periods are not too heavy and they're regular, usually.

I have not had sex, nor any kind of sexual activity with any guy, therefore I can't be pregnant. However, I've been sick the past week or so - coughing, somewhat of a fever ( my normal temp is 36.5C and the highest I got last week was 37.7C) and I've been taking the medicine prescribed by my doctor (nothing I've not taken before when sick).

Last month (13th-18th) was when I was on my period and when I took blood tests due to some nausea which is now gone. Nothing abnormal, except for having more-than-average hemoglobin.

I can feel some kind of cramps for 2 days or so, as well as bloating. I took a long warm bath yesterday, as I read it could help, but nothing so far.

If anything else is relevant please let me know and I can add it. Sorry in advance because this is a long story but I'm losing hope and I could really use some advice. My back story is long and complicated, but to spare you the details I suffered from a severe eating disorder and ended up at 120(ish) kg at my heaviest, before crash dieting down and back up for years. During this time I suffered with some health issues of course, including indigestion, constipation and such but I figured and was told this was due to my weight.

Fast forward to now and I finally stabilised my weight and have felt much better for the past while until maybe six months ago. I started having horrible episodes of nausea, vomiting, stomach pain/bloating, constipation all when I eat usually. I have had x rays, which showed nothing. My GP then suggested I was bulimic, and was skeptical when I denied it. I realise my history makes it likely but its just not true, I wouldn't lie about it after all of this.

So I recently finally got referred to have an endoscopy but as I had to not eat before it it found nothing... because it happens when I eat and I wasnt eating. Now my GP is entirely convinced its in my head and nothing I say or do will convince him otherwise. He has given me antacids and they dont do a thing.

I just want a second opinion. Could this really be all in my head? I just feel like it isnt, really appreciate any suggestions or anyone reading this at all, thanks.

Primary complaint: As I was trying to fall asleep, I immediately started feeling like my head was vibrating and my thoughts were echoing multiple times as thoughts poured through my mind and I could feel every single thing working in my body. 

Any existing medical issues: BPD, moderate depression, PTSD.

Current medications: amoxicillin (500 MG)and ibuprofen (400 MG) for a sore tooth. (Stopped taking it about a day and a half ago)

I do drink or smoke very very occasionally. Last time I’ve drank was a week and a half ago and it Was two shots with family. Last time I smoked and got high was last year. Although, my friend did offer me a pull this morning. I took a small one and had no effects, simply wanted to give company to friend.

So, here’s the deal:

As I’m falling asleep, I immediately start dreaming as soon as maybe a minute into me closing my eyes. Nothing crazy, just some events that happened through the day and hypothetically situations. It usually takes me a bit to fall asleep but I was feeling pretty tired so I put my phone down and close my eyes. 

I start feeling my entire body as if i was in a tunnel spinning. My thoughts were so loud and echoed consistently as I was thinking. I was completely conscious but unable to move and I figured it was just sleep paralysis. So I talk to myself, convince myself it’s that.

However, as I “wake up”, I fall back instantly and again it happens, this time my breathing starts to hitch and I start to breathe incredibly quickly. Again, I wake up and try to text my boyfriend but fall asleep too quickly. This time I feel the blood pumping to my heart and I can physically feel my heart moving and hurting. It felt like I was dying. Each time the symptoms from the first time persist and it feels like something is wrong. I’m sort of terrified to go to sleep and I don’t know if I’m hallucinating or if my body is warning me.

foul smell in mouth where she has a crown (she has 10 crowns, the smell of coming from a specific one). dentists havent helped. she takes extremely good care of her teeth, brushing, flossing, and uses a waterpick every day.

feels very intense vibrations in her arms and legs constantly, mostly when she is resting. 

her elbows to her hands fall asleep

when she eats certain foods, like bread, she gets very tired and feels sick. Because of this she usually tries to eat fruits, vegetables, and nuts. It has progressed over time and she used to be able to eat whatever she wanted.

At night in bed her bones hurt very bad. I also noticed she bruises very easily.

She used to, about a year ago, also have bad heart palpitations at night along with the vibrations. At the same time, when shed close her eyes she would see intense flashes of geometric shapes and patterns, one after the other. This all happening at the same time with the tinnitus as well when she was trying to sleep made it very hard for her.

She believes that some of her symptoms could be caused by a bad crown, but dentists wont listen to her and try to help. She has a friend who similarly was very sick and went to a holistic dentist in mexico who (if i remember correctly) switched her bad crown with a porcelain crown and she was immediately 100% better. If no American doctors are willing to listen to her I'll take her to the doctor in mexico.

"A burn on eyeball?31M Hello. I have recently started a new job in fabrication work and am using MIG welders and grinders on a constant basis. I am usually fairly good about using my eye pro all day long, however I may have gotten either a spark from either the grinding wheel or welder in my eye at one point yesterday. I don't know when it happened and it was not irritated at all yesterday. Today my eye is very red and irritated. Upon closer inspection I found a small black dot floating above my iris. I did as many of the internet self help methods of removing a foreign object from the eye (ex: flushing with water. Wiping with a rag, ECT...) but the spot has not moved. My boss has told me ""this happens a lot around here. It's just a burn and should heal in a few days."" He even tried one of his methods to remove it that he has used ""all the time.""

My question is this: Is my boss correct in thinking this is a burn on my eye that will heal or should I be concerned that this is an object stuck deep in my eye? If so, can I remove it on my own? I do not have health insurance and since it's not affecting my vision (and I'm not completely sure when/where it happened), I don't want to get workers comp involved.

I am unable to capture a good picture of the injury, but it is located in the upper part of my iris, but sort of floating on top. Feels like a sty.

"Persistent headache, vertigo, neck pain for weeks after a second episode. Neurophysician is saying its a TIA and no big deal. Can TIA even persist after 24 hours?Age: 56
Ethnicity: Bangladeshi
Duration of Complaint: Since April 2019
Conditions: Hypertension lifelong, Angina since 2017.  
Weight: 55kg. 
Height: 5 feet 4. 

My father is 56, living in Bangladesh. He always had major hypertension but does not smoke nor does he have diabetes or cholesterol now. He does have Angina and did have coronary angiogram in 2017 after failing the treadmill test and it was found that small arteries are clogged that cannot be stented and only medications suggested and the doctors said its not a big deal.

On April of this year he had hypertension, ringing in ears, sweating, fullness in ears, hearing loss for a couple of days and when my Aunt died he had a neurological crisis. He had severe room spinning vertigo, high tinnitus, said his head felt like its not there and was taken to emergency. Some tests were done, but they discharged him with a questionable diagnosis of vestibular neuritis.

The test reports were: hearing loss in one ear 70%, another moderate.The MRI said possible hydrocephalus, possible lacunar stroke, demyelination signs possible neurodegeneration. There was a 42% stenosis in the left carotid artery.

The neuro said that the swelling of CSF is marginal and not hydrocephalus and due to brain shrinkage with age. Lacunar strokes are normal given his age and neurodegeneration can only be diagnosed later with time.

We visited ENT, Neurosurgeon, Cardiologist--no one could give a diagnosis.

Now on 9/10/2019 he had a neuro crisis again. He was in a bit of mental stress and was looking at renovation work done on the house. This time it was the vertigo was moderate compared to the severe one experienced in the first attack. There was heavy sweating and this time, unlike the previous there was a lot of significant painful headaches. Stiff neck, heavy head when stretching head up to look up or bowing head to look down, sweating. Till today, the symptoms have not decreased much.

We visited the neurosurgeon on 12/10/19 and he says that it looks like its a TIA and not to worry because stress seems to trigger it. He gave a few meds for the symptoms and gave encouragement not to worry and that prognosis is very good. No hospitalization or test was prescribed other than an x-ray of the neck even though we asked for tests. My father had a slip and fall and hurt his elbow a two weeks before this but found no issue with the neck. Blood pressure at the neuro was 150/90 by the way.

However I have read that TIA by definition cannot have symptoms lasting more than a day. Has anyone else ever faced a similar condition? Is this likely to be TIA?

"Passing out/seizure like response to laughing hardNot really sure my title is an appropriate description but it's the only way I know to day it. To start, I am a 32M in the US. I am 210ish lbs. Health history is long, including injuries on active duty but nothing head trauma related. I do not have diabetes or anything like that. I did have my blood tests done at VA hospital recently and my AST and ALT levels were quite high... I remember ALT being like 126. Not sure if it's related to my issue or not but figured I should include it.


Back on June 2nd, I experienced my first episode of what I'm trying to get a lead on. I was driving home from work, listening to one of my stand up comedy stations on Pandora. I laughed...pretty hard at a joke.. then blacked out. When I came to, I was driving down a ledge 75ft into a ravine. Totalled car. I just had whip lash. They diagnosed me with having a micro sleep incident because at the time..I didn't remember laughing prior to passing out. 

Fast forward two months, I'm playing a video game with a buddy of mine. Something happens and I start laughing. I felt like I was going to faint..my whole body locks up. I remember hearing almost what reminds me electricity and static. Followed by me being able to say nothing but sort of a mix between a g and d sound in a stutter. After this happens..I come back to..my whole body hurts. Aches. It's as if every bit of my energy is drained. 

Now..I'm starting to connect the first incident to the second.

Then fast forward to today. We are at the doctor for my daughters first year checkup. She is being a handful waiting on the doc to come in. She ends up.tsking off crawling across the bed thing in the room and crashes face first into the wall. I laughed so hard that the above symptoms came back again. I didn't do the stutter thing but my wife said I just sort of stopped laughing... Wobbled..then I came to and felt like all my energy was gone. 


So now I have three times where this has happened. It's never happened before. However it's scary to me to think this could happen at any time. I'm thinking maybe I need to see nuero but they evaluated me after my accident and didn't find anything.

I can notice a distinct difference in my own B.O after a couple of hours of playing an intense First Person Shooter compared to how I smell after a run or playing basketball.

So the basics. 38M 6’ 225 pounds. I’ve been a semi heavy drinker since 21 ( firefighter ). In decent shape I ride 30-60 miles weekly.

About 2 months ago I had some upper right abdomen pain. It was maybe a 5 or 6 in the pain scale. I suffered with it for almost 12 hours before finally going to the hospital. Lab test and CT scan. Labs were all good except for lipas being 155 ( not that high ) but the CT scan showed my pancreas was inflamed. ER doc said it was a mild case of acute pancreatitis. But he also wanted me to follow up because it could be a early cancer. Well that really sucked to hear. Sent me home with info for a clear diet and pain meds. Never took the pain meds and after 4 days of clear/clean eating my symptoms were gone.

So I started trying to line up a follow up with a GI doc. Went to see them about 2 weeks later and we agreed to a follow up CT scan. That scan came back completely clear with all fluid around my pancreas resolved and no signs of any tumors.

So that was great news. But I still am having some floating stools sometimes. I am eating a lot of fiber and vegetables. But it just seems kinda random with what I’ve been eating and the past diagnoses.

My main issue is that in august I went to the ER. I’ve had pains in my stomach. Cramps, diarrhea/loose stools, and random pain. When I went to the ER they discharged me and said everything looked normal. Blood work was fine a little under vitamin K but not alarming. Urine was fine and CBC was fine. I went to the ER because I was feeling nauseous and couldn’t figure out why. 3 weeks ago, I figured out I was lactose intolerant out of the blue. Every time I would eat dairy like pizza I would get bad burning pains after a day by my front pelvis. I really can’t eat fruits like apples or pears either. And I have cramps on my flanks. That’s probably trapped gas. I’ve cut out dairy entirely and stopped feeling those burning pains. My other doctor says I need fiber and exercise. I work from home but every time I try to exercise I get bloated on my lower back. I know I probably need an endoscopy or colonoscopy but I can’t afford it right now. I don’t know if I have a bacterial infection, IBS, Crohns, or something else. I have no blood in stool. 

My second problem is that I went to the ER today for just being nauseous this morning and burping. I don’t have a fever but I feel warm and 2 days ago, I have this weird pain in the belly button.

Also have IBS (not taking medicine for) and family history of Crohns, cancer(mom diagnosed with Langerhans cell histiocytosis in mid to late 20’s), Alzheimer’s and heart problems. Never had any of the four.

So it started months ago I was developing these red spots I had one on my boob almost looked like a hickey and then it got bigger and then a week later I got another one right above it then a week later I got two more one on the opposite boob and one on the neck then later found one on my side close to my back my boyfriend called them ghost hickeys and I wasn’t sure how I was getting them a coworker told me probably stress and maybe I should see a psych well anyway the red spots ended up going away before I decided to see a psych but still knew I should. Well after the red spots went away I got out of the shower and was drying my hair with the towel and as I was about to dry my body I noticed blood on my elbow and I wiped it away and I had no cut For whatever reason I looked up of course nothing and then there it was again more blood so I frantically start looking around and examining my arm really hard and I realized my right nipple was bleeding only the right and it was like it was oozing blood too much just be a dry nipple because shouldn’t both my nipples bleed. I looked for cuts and nothing and I thought well did I rub the towel too hard and remembered I only dried my hair when my nipple was bleeding no soreness no cut no itchyness nothing just blood. Never happened before Fast forward to last month I started getting bad headaches front of head between eyebrows worst headache ever. Next day I got a nosebleed on the right side randomly I was just studying and my nose started dripping I hadn’t had a nose bleed since I was 7z Usually I get a small headache when I switch meds but goes away after couple days these migraines were happening everyday and lasted 1-3 hours nothing relieved it. Fast forward to now. Still headaches but almost a week and a half ago I’ve developed sharp pain under my right shoulder blade and aching on right side of my chest and a dull pain on the outside of my right boob towards the armpit area also I’ve developed a bunch of tiny moles on chest within last couple days and developed freckles on nipples a month ago. I don’t know if these all connect or if these are a bunch of random things and I have nothing to worry about I kind of want to see a doctor but don’t want to go in looking stupid because I’m actually fine.

TL;DR - Symptoms- Couple months ago freckles on nipples and red spots randomly appearing on chest but went away after few weeks freckles still here. 2 months ago right nipple bloody discharge. 1 month ago everyday migraines between eyebrows and right nostril randomly bleed.

Should I bring this up to a psychologist? Is this my depression and anxiety doing this, or is it something else? I don't expect definite answers, obviously, but a nudge in the right direction would be appreciated.

Hey docs, had some typical blood work done yesterday as ordered by my primary physician and am not sure about some of the things that came up. I’ve been told I was borderline anemic 5+ years ago, told I have low ferritin levels a couple years ago and as I understand might be anemic or borderline anemic again. I don’t eat meat much at all and every iron supplement I’ve taken (not many tbh) has hurt my stomach pretty badly and wasn’t worth the pain. I know I don’t eat enough foods with iron in them but I’m not good at eating in general as I rarely have an appetite and if I do I crave something sweet. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes but I do normally eat a 5mg cannabis gummy before bed. I’ve also been taking a decent amount of vitamins such as l-theanine, l-lysine, l-glutamine, Vitamin D (5,000 IU a few times a week), magnesium Glycinate (400mg a few times a week), mega-stress b vitamin (various b vitamins included), glucosamine chondrotin with MSM, etc. I’m going to go over the results of my blood panel with my doctor in a couple of weeks but I’m tired of being tired and want to do something about it before then. Any help would be much appreciated.

Sex: Female

Height: 5'3

Weight: 115

Race: Caucasian

Duration of complaint: 17 days

Location: N/A

Any existing relevant medical issues: ADHD

Current medications: Adderall 30mg XR

I am a generally healthy person. I drink occasionally, exercise, have no prior medical issues/disease other than a previous case of strep in 2016 and every 6-12 months a 2 day cold usually with season change.

Come this October, I've had a a list of event's that seem to not be ending. Timeline below:

10/1 - Got a sudden sore throat (right lymph node) that came on quickly during work

10/2 - Sore throat worsened a bit, and feeling of fatigue

10/3 - Stayed home to rest, sore throat subsided and felt better by morning 10/4

10/8 - exactly a week later, sore throat returned (right lymph node), but came with pain from my ear to my neck

10/9 - Woke up unable to open mouth/swallow without excruciating pain - went to Urgent Care and was diagnosed with a bad case of Strep that had apparently traveled toward my right ear and farther down the lymph note causing sever throat swelling. Was given a dose of 3 prednisone in office, and scripted 4 days of prednisone (4 pills first day 3 second day, 2 on third day, 1 on last) and 7 of amoxicillin (3 pills/daily).

10/12 - finally felt relieve - this is the first day I could open my mouth wide enough to digest any non-liquids. My fatigue settled. I was able to get some brief time outside walking and light chores.

10/14 (very early morning)- My menstrual cycle begins (a bit early - expected 10/18, but stress often causes mine to fluctuate)

10/14 (midday) - sudden chills/aches, extreme fatigue come on while at work. By the time I left I had a mild fever

10/15 - Period darkens and stops through first half of day; fever/aches/chills worsen, I leave work midday to rest. All cold/flu symptoms subside by evening.

10/15-10/17 - extreme vaginal swelling, and burning sensation when urinating (labia, almost as if an irritant or allergic reaction. I had used organic tampons that I don't use frequently, but the length of the swelling and discomfort was alarming)

10/18 (morning) - Swelling /discomfort is not completely gone, but has become moderate/mild. I drink a glass of water, and a glass of tea first thing in the mornings. Half an hour later as I was getting ready to shower, I unexpectedly got sick and threw up the liquids up.

10/18 (mid day) - A red itchy rash appears first, and most prevalent on my chest, lightly on stomach/mid section, arms and back, and moderately on thighs. When under extreme stress, I have developed hives/welts before. I have no fever, no other symptoms other than still mild genital sensitivity and a rash. It is not worsening, but hasn't started to clear.

Things to note:

I have not changed or altered my diet, skin care, bath products, etc.

I have no history of STDs and was last tested 6 months ago (blood) with negative results across the board. I have had 2 new partners since then, both using protection each time (although I know this isn't 100% to prevent STDs). The most recent partner was 10/5 (hence all the STD suspicions).

I have no notable food/drug allergies

I have no signs of bumps or sores (genital or otherwise) - I had a mild panic due to the flu like symptoms and sudden stop of menstruation with the vaginal swelling/burning with urination and have checked more times a day than I'd like to admit.

I have an appointment at a clinic next Thursday (thanks HMO healthcare for the limited resources), and will return to Urgent care again prior if fever/severe symptoms return. I've spent way too much time on the internet listing a variety of predictions (I contracted Herpes, I have Lupus, and autoimmune disorder, etc).

My eyes first started to itch frequently around the age of 14. Within the past 6 years I've been to five different opthalmologists, three of which claimed I had allergic conjunctivitis. The other two opthalmologists said that my eyes were just dry and gave me lubricant drops. It may be worth noting that I've recently moved from an african country with a tropical climate to a European country (my eyes have been at their worst since moving here). The opthalmologist I most recently visited (two weeks ago) told me that he doubted it was allergic conjunctivitis as the papillae under my eyelids were not enlarged and the conjunctiva was not uniformly red (blood vessels are largest around the iris). He gave me a lubricant eye drop called hyco san and told me to continue with the anti histamines I had already been taking (cetirizine). I followed his advice and did not rub my eyes whilst using the new drops, but my eyes have been even worse than usual the past few days. They have been constantly read and it seems like the area around the iris is very inflamed and slightly raised. Medication I have previously used includes 1) Allergo comod (given the best results but I was told not to use them for extended periods) 2) Mast cell inhibitor (did not seem to relieve symptoms) 3) Antihistamines (may be improving symptoms slightly) 4) optrex eye drops for itchy eyes (helps relieve the itching but eyes remain red and inflamed.

"Mitral valve prolapse and possible pneumoniaHi all! Info: 24M, 165lbs, 5'11"", caucasian, taking sumatriptan for migraines and meloxicam as needed for TMJ disorder. I have had a persistent cough for the past 3.5 weeks. It's worse at night and mornings. When I take deep breaths, I fall short of breath and start coughing. This has been accompanied by loss of voice, congestion, and white mucus. The voice and congestion issues were pretty bad during the first week, but recovered within a few days. In the last couple days, the voice and congestion have returned. I tried sudafed and other allergy meds but they didn't work.

I went to the urgent care today and my resting heart rate was 89. It's normally around 70. He listened to my lungs and agreed that it didn't sound smooth. I did a nebulizer and he rechecked everything. He said it sounded better and my heart rate increased to 93, which he said is consistent with a lung infection. He prescribed a zpack and an albuterol inhaler, but wasn't sure whether it's a a viral or bacterial infection. He mentioned something about it possibly being community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). 

I failed to mention that I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) 8 years ago. I've done testing every 2-3 years and each time they've found minor regurgitation, but the cardiologist was never worried. However, I do remember that my original cardiologist mentioned how bacterial infections could cause concern with the MVP. I don't recall everything he said since I was 16. But I'm concerned about it now since I never mentioned to the doctor today I had MVP.

 Should I be worried? Also, if it is CAP, does that have any impact on MVP I should worry about?

"Pain and intensifying bruising 2 weeks after surgery.32M. 5’8” 160lbs. Smoker. Will upload pics in comments.

TL:DR I had knee surgery Oct 3rd. Complications from the start. Bruising began October 10 and are getting worse still with major pain on inner thigh and along the outside. 

Detailed:

I had an arthroscopic knee surgery to resection my lateral meniscus October 3rd. I’ve had 2 previous surgeries on this knee with the first being an ACL reconstruction (hamstring used for repair) and meniscus repair in 2006 and another on my meniscus somewhere around 2011. This surgery has been by far the worst I’ve ever had and now bruising is intensifying weeks after surgery.

Day of surgery I was way too high from the fentanyl to feel anything. Following day things were naturally hurting however the pain in my thigh so so intense I couldn’t lift my leg to even get it into bed. My gf had to help me so I wouldn’t flex the muscles and even that was excruciating. For the following days I grit through the pain and dealt with it while taking hydrocodone as instructed (1 every 6HR), elevating, icing, heating pad, massaging, and doing range of motion exercises. The thigh didn’t prevent me from getting into bed again but the improvement has been limited. Thigh, knee, and calf pain and tenderness has been high. 

October 9th came and I had the last two pills of my 20 pill prescription and I dreaded what it was going to be like without something to cut the pain. Contacted the VA (who did the surgery) and I was encouraged to go to the ER and be evaluated for a clot. I did and everything was fine. I was sent home with 1% diclofenac sodium gel which has done absolutely nothing. October 10th I woke to significant bruising on the back side of my knee and along the outside of my leg from mid calf to mid thigh. Bruising got much worse in the following days but seemed to slow down.

Today I had my post op at the VA. I explained everything I have here to them as well as I still have issues with the muscle on the top inside of the thigh as well as the outside of the thigh to the mid calf. (Its more or less like drawing a line through the ITB extending to mid calf) They didn’t seem to care much. Told me it’s just normal surgery complications and to just elevate more and use heating pad. I did as I was told and now the bruising is intensifying again and not adding any relief to the thigh muscles.

Is the pain and intensifying bruising normal 2 weeks out from surgery? I know they use a tourniquet on the thigh which can explain the thigh pain but these two areas haven’t gotten better at all. Seems incredibly odd compared to my other surgeries particularly the first that I would think would be more trauma to the leg given the hamstring. And I know heat can help bruising but it seems this is making it worse. Is this normal or should I be more concerned and skip the VA for better treatment?",AskDocs,t3_djxybd

I've also had throat pain that comes and goes, sometimes while eating.

"Moderator Post: Impeachment-related questions and why they are not appropriate for this sub -aka- Heck no we're not touching that hot potatoHey all, 

We get a lot of posts relating to breaking news, and the ongoing impeachment inquiry in the United States is no exception. This is obviously a big story that deals with the law, and we know you have questions. After discussion among the mod team, we have decided that **we will not allow impeachment related posts in this sub right now**; they will be removed without further explanation.

We are doing this for several reasons. First, impeachment is a political and legislative process that takes place in the court of public opinion and behind closed doors in Congress. While it is a process based on constitutional and statutory law (indeed some parts may be litigated before the House votes or the Senate sits in trial); it will be a quasi-legal procedure where the outcome is as much determined by political considerations as the letter of the law. In short, it will never end up being tried before a court, so it is out of our wheelhouse.

In addition, it's impossible for anyone to provide answers to most questions. Impeachment is a sui generis process and there is very little law on which to base answers. Everything that is happening right now is taking place in a grey area, which our devoted readers will recognize is not unusual. What is _very unusual_ is that it is a grey area nearly devoid of statutory and case law borders. Anyone who claims to know for sure what will happen is lying - it’s all wishes, guesses, dowsing, and witchcraft at this point. The discussions in here would be speculative at best and argumentative at worst. /r/Legaladvice is not a forum for arguments about politics; there are plenty of places on Reddit and elsewhere to do that.

The mods agree there are fascinating legal issues here. There will likely be several Supreme Court and Court of Appeals cases that spring from this process like Athena from Zeus' forehead. If and when there is useful and interesting discussion to be had or information to be disseminated, we may open megathreads. For those few impeachment-related legal questions that likely have definite answers* we encourage you to post them in /r/legaladviceofftopic. Even there, however, the moderators will remove all but the most benign and germane. 

We value your contributions and input greatly. At present, however, we believe this sub has nothing to offer that isn't provided by other more politically focused forums**. Thank you for understanding this position, and we invite you to comment below with any questions, concerns, or just pics of your pets.

I was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. I am a senior and about to graduate. They reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. They only gave me info for one class. Then a week later they lifted my no contact ban based on new info. And another week later they entirely lifted my ban due to the person saying they completely lied and the allegations we're not true. Despite this I am still ""under investigation"".

I missed too much class to reasonably still complete. Three full weeks of missed senior level classes. I had to drop out due to this condition.

I was also let go at my prestigious internship because they only hire full time students. 

Because of this I have no school and no job.

The university refused any refund to me upon request and their response was ""the actions were necessary due to the severity of the accusation"" despite never hearing my side.

Do I have any rights whatsoever??? I'm out a job. Thousands of dollars and school.",legaladvice,t3_dktlan
"Dismissed from College after suicide attemptA friend of mine tried taking her life last month at our college. It’s a college in New York. Realizing she didn’t want to go through with it, she contacted a friend who took her to the hospital where she stayed inpatient for about a week or two. After being released she returned to school and saw a counselor on campus who cleared her and told her that she was well enough to return to classes, but advised her to speak to the Dean so that her missed classes would be excused which she did. Three weeks pass by of her going to class and living in the dorm before she’s told by the Dean that she can’t live on campus, isn’t allowed in or around any residential buildings on campus, and gives her three days to move off campus with no warning. My friend appealed the decision giving evidence that she’d be seeing a therapist regularly, was given a proper diagnosis and medication to treat her illness while hospitalized, and created a plan with her therapist to demonstrate the follow through for her treatment that would take place for a sufficient period of time. The appeal was turned down and the Dean gave her no reason or explanation as to why aside that she had to leave. 

She cannot commute to campus so she no longer can attend the college.  Is this legal? Especially if she was cleared by a mental health professional who said that she was stable and okay to return to the college?",legaladvice,t3_dkwz52
"Restaurant owners took 24% of my tip last night.UPDATE: I’m actually working a shift at this place right now. My plan was to talk with the owners in person after the shift, however a handful of you have suggested emailing/texting would be better since there’s no guarantee they’d consent to being recorded. My plan now is to email them either after my shift tonight or some time tomorrow after I’ve made some necessary calls. I understand now that it may be legal after all given that it was an included service charge. Some have speculated that they may be paying employer-based taxes with it, however for the past five years I’ve been here they haven’t been going anywhere near our gratuities. Hopefully they’ll be honest with me when I email them and I can let you guys know what’s really going on. Again, thank you all for the advice. I’m trying my best to reply to all of the comments. I wasn’t expecting this much attention.

———————

I live in Maryland. I wait tables for $3.63 an hour plus tips. Last night I was handed an invoice for a party I was working and at the very bottom, written in pen, the owner’s wife/co-owner wrote “tip x 0.78 = tip for server”. That’s 22% of my gratuity. On top of that they’ve been taking 2% of our gratuity every night to help pay for the credit/debit card transactions. The fact that the owners are taking our tip money because they need spending money infuriates me. Especially considering we already share 25% with the support service staff.

Edit: Thanks all for the advice. My plan now is to confront one of the owners about it and make sure to record what’s said. Updates to come later.

EDIT 2: To all those concerned, I actually started work at another job 3 months ago in anticipation of this restaurant going out of business, or me having to quit. Haven’t pulled the trigger yet because even with both jobs money is tight. Being trained to bartend at the new place and from the looks of it, once I’m done with my training, the money from that will sustain me enough so that I can quit the restaurant in question. I appreciate the concern, you all have been incredibly helpful.",legaladvice,t3_dkjyxk
"[MO] My employer forged my signature on a non-compete contractI've been at my current company for 8 years and am leaving to start my own business with a former co-worker. I brought some clients with me from my last job when I started here, and the ones that are aware that I'm going to work for myself have already made it clear that they're going to follow me. Most of them stayed because they liked the work I personally was doing for them, but had become unhappy with my company itself in the last few years.

I gave my job three months' notice as a courtesy, since I have a few projects I'm finishing up and didn't want to take on new ones and then leave halfway through. That was a week ago. Friday afternoon, I got an email from HR with some generic stuff about our exit policies, plus a reminder about the non-compete clause in my contract.

I never signed a non-compete, and I emailed HR back to let them know. This set off a long string of emails where they kept insisting that I had, and I kept asking to see it. Finally, I got a scanned copy of a non-compete with what appears to be my signature at the bottom.

I KNOW I didn't sign this thing. I got screwed over by a non-compete years and years ago, and I've refused to agree to one ever since. The copy HR sent isn't just a paragraph hidden in a longer contract, either, it's its own separate thing that goes on for pages. There's no way in the world I could have just missed it.

How do I go about proving that I never signed this? The business plan my partner and I came up with depends heavily on keeping clients that have been loyal to us for years, and we didn't figure fighting a lawsuit into our financial arrangements.

"Planning to drop out and cut ties with my parents without their knowledge, is this legal? (New York)Hi, I really need some information on how I could go about this. 


I’m currently a freshman in college, failing miserably. I’m planning on withdrawing completely and I have a friend that I’m planning on staying with. I have been planning on cutting ties with my family for some time now, and since I’m 18 it’s possible. There’s only one problem: financial aid. 


My parents co-signed for FAFSA and Excellsior, and even co-signed for a private bank loan. Since I was unable to sign as an independent, I didn’t have the option to cut them out of the equation financially. The private loan and Excellsior aren’t the problem, FAFSA is. There has been no clear information on if I’m allowed to. I’m unsure on if I’m even allowed to do this.

Okay so, I'm 16 and I have 3 little siblings. They are 12, 10, and 9 if that matters. Currently, we have been overseas for a few years. Our mom came with us, and she is undocumented, so she left the United States with no papers or green card. 

Today she gave me an ultimatum and said I need to talk to my father and tell him to sign papers a governor sent to her digitally so she can come back without any consequences and with my siblings and I, or else she will contact the government and try to get child support and file for 'mental and emotional abuse' because that's ""worse in their eyes.""

"Slayer Rule - Murder-SuicideHello Reddit,

My family has had the unfortunate burden of dealing with a murder suicide within the family. Long story short, my grandfather murdered his wife (my step grandmother). He called the police, admitted to the crime, and before the police could show up to the property, he took his own life. My father and grandfather have not kept in touch over the last 35+ years (I've never met my grandfather). We are not aware of any relatives of the victim, and assumed that we would be the ones to deal with the property while probate figures out what's going to happen. We have recently been made aware of the Slayer Rule, which prohibits the ""Slayer"" from inheriting anything from his victim. (We live in Oregon, btw). Does the Slayer rule prohibit my father (and his two sisters), from any inheritance? The victim has no children of her own. Thanks for any advice...

"Protecting myself in partner's custody battleHello,

My partner and I have been dating for over a year. She has kids that are toddlers. I have met them and see them frequently. She has a 50/50 parenting arrangement with her ex and it has always been high conflict, but recently, it has gotten much worse. Her ex reopened their parenting agreement in court and is trying to get full custody of the kids. She has a lawyer and the court has appointed a GAL who she has been working with. In addition to the court case, her ex has been trying to get orders of protection, he has been opening up DCFS cases, and has been harassing her with night time wellness checks and every communication they have on Family Wizard results in an argument. He's basically using any legal means necessary to rattle her cage. In addition to all of this, we are worried that the ex is coaching the children because recently on his parenting time, the kids have been going to school and making claims of physical abuse against my partner. I have never seen anything during my time with her and her kids that would make me suspect that was happening or I would have contacted the authorities. I have every reason to believe that these claims are bogus and her poor kids are being used as a means to an end. I have a good relationship with her kids. They adore me and I try to take a role of the funny adult friend that they can have fun with.

My partner is working through the process with her attorney and the GAL and I'm trying to be as supportive as I can be, but honestly we feel helpless. The process is slow going.

My question is, how do I protect myself during this? Seeing the erratic behavior from the ex and the recent false abuse claims are making me concerned that it is just a matter of time before I'm targeted as a side channel way to attack her. Do I need to get an attorney of my own? What steps can I take to defend against the schemes of her ex? I have tried to stay out of it and I have very limited interaction with her ex. I attended a kids school activity a couple times because her attorney wanted a witness there. I attended a couple court dates for moral support, but other than that I have no interaction with him. Although, I would be more an happy to babysit the kids while she runs an errand, I am never alone with the kids out of fear that the ex will try something sneaky.

EDIT: Location, IL.

TL;DR My partner is in a very messy custody battle with her ex. Is there anything that I can do to protect myself from being pulled into it?

Almost all the tips come from credit cards. Every night when I clock out I see I’ve made $40-$100 in tips but after my manager does something with the machine I end up with $1-2 in tips. Is this legal? She’s never explicitly said we have a tip pool or have delved any further quite frankly into explaining how tips are divided. First time I asked her she said they go towards your $15/hr pay ($12.50 is minimum wage in washington). I don’t understand how that works since I get $40-50 in tips for a 5 hour shift. Where does the rest of the money go? I confronted her last night officially asking how the tips get divided because I’m having trouble understanding. She explained that the tips are divided between the front end and back end (cooks+dishwashers) and are divided by every hour everyone works. She also explained how its now a set $15/hr + no tips instead of $13/hr with tips because in the past the workers got upset for some employees getting more tips than them because they work the busier days. (???) She’s not that great at explaining things in English but she was saying how she has a whole team of financial advisors and her own CPA to figure all this stuff out implying that it’s all handled and taken care of. 
We also don’t get any of the cash tips in the tip jar because of her reasoning which is “People don’t tip that much so every week it comes out to $8.” So she pockets that I guess. I also want to note she didn’t ever say in our interview that we get tips through the machine.

"Friend being manipulated in a divorceDivorce proceedings in Oklahoma

Alright so the whole situation is messed up but boils down fairly easily.  Friend of mine has been in a terrible marriage for many years to a man who is verbally and emotionally abusive, and manipulated her to get his way.  He threatens suicide any time she’s brought up divorce, or threatens that if they DID divorce he’d get 100% custody because 6 or so years ago she had a one night fling with a rando.  

Now she’s finally set on actually getting a divorce, but he’s locked down their finances and she can’t afford a lawyer.  They just had a huge blowup fight where he was yelling at her and then physically took her phone from her so he could yell at her more.  He’s pushed her to the point that she’s pretty much willing to sign any divorce papers just to get it over with.  Which is the problem.  He’s already said he’s putting language in the papers in order to control who the kids can be around even during when the kids are with her.  She said she’s willing to sign that, just to get things over with.  Those of us trying to help her have tried to explain he’s just trying to exert more control that extends past the divorce.  Here’s my questions:

1. What can she do if he’s locked their finances down and can’t afford a lawyer because of it?  Are there ways of making him pay all the costs and fees?

2. If these friends of hers aren’t criminals or somesuch, can be really decree who the kids can be around during the mother’s custodial time?  Or is that something a judge will throw out?

"UK - 19 year old being paid £1.20 an hourSerious responses only please. 
I have trained with a martial arts academy since I was twelve. This academy is well know in the UK for extremely high standards in student ability and very hard belt testing. 

When I was 15 I started to volunteer in the class before mine just to get some experience in working with children. Around the same time I was asked to help out at their summer camps. I was getting ‘paid’ £10 a day to work for six hours. Despite the fact that kids younger than me got £20 a day for the same work. 

Flash forwards a few years and I transferred to the main club in the franchise. I trained pretty regularly (twice a week) and paid £46 a month for classes. 
I was informed that I would have to ‘volunteer’ for twelve hours of coaching in order to get my black- belt. This is not what the guide lines by the British (being vague here) council say. It is also not a requirement at any other club. 
I completed my volunteering at the club by doing three hours before my lesson and then training for an hour and a half. This meant I got my 12 hours done in four weeks. 
I diddnt get paid to do this, despite doing the same job or even more responsibility than others who where getting paid. 

I saw a public announcement of a job in the onsite cafe for the club and was given the job when I applied. I was initially asked to work 3 nights a week but it was bumped down to 2. I made £7.50 an hour. I typically worked 3:30- 7:00 or 3:30- 6:30 pm. I never signed a contract and only got paid cash in hand. My wage slips said ‘volunteering expenses’ and often had the wrong hours on them.

Around the time I got paid for my first month in the cafe. I said I was going to stop coaching. The next month I got paid for coaching. But it was still only a small amount. 

The real issues started in the last few months. I stoped the cafe because it was causing me anxiety due to the nature of all the work to be done. The club hired two new people to work the cafe hours. But one got fired. I was asked to fill in (because I had the training). I tried to said I would rather be coaching, as it didn’t affect my mental health negatively. 
Some new people where hired to coach my lesson ( but we’re given contracts and paid decently). I eventually stoped doing the cafe but was not offed my coaching hours back. 
I was told I have to attend new training sessions, but won’t be getting paid for them. It is costing me more to get there at the moment. 
I have been told I have to pay class fees in order to work at the club. I have to work at the club in order to grade for my next belt. And in order to work at the club I have to sit an exam and attend training sessions ( to do with coaching) that I won’t get paid for but are costing me £8 a week to attend. I am a nursing student and just simply can not afford this. 
A friend ( only a belt lower than me) is also a nursing student, does similar hours to me and is only getting £20 a week. Her wage works out £20 a month. But it cost her £12.50 to even travel to the club. 
Please can someone help.",legaladvice,t3_dl0dyh
"Florida, my nephew is non-verbal autistic and was injured at school, but the school is ghosting us on the detailsMy nephew is non-verbal autistic and attends a public school that is labeled as an ESE. Two weeks ago my BIL receives a phone call from the school indicating that he (nephew) had been in a fight and injured his lip and that it needed stitches. So my BIL starts heading towards the school when they call again stating that they were transporting him to the ER that was listed on his paperwork, just meet them there. OK, so no problem, by the time he got to the ER the doctor was almost finished gluing the wound closed, and then he was discharged to the care of his father. Now the ER did not offer any meds for pain, and all that they did was clean and close the wound. On Monday the 14th we took him back to his PCP due to the fact that there was still swelling. The PCP looked at it and said he suspected there was an abscess but the clinic was unable to do anything to it because of the location of the wound (face) he advised that we take him across the street the ER and have them drain it. 

We took him to the ER and they prescribed antibiotics. Now on Friday we took him back to the ER because it was clear that there was something more wrong. Due to my nephew's disability he can not tell anyone what happened or what is hurting so this makes it much more difficult, plus he has other issues where he can not sit still, etc. So armed with this info the ER decided that they wanted to do a CT scan of his jaw, but he would not lay down for the procedure, so they ended up sedating him, it took 4 different sedatives and over 9 hours to get him sedated enough to get him to lay down for the CT scan. 

The ER doctor reveals that the CT scan reveled that his jaw is fractured! He asked how this happened and all we can tell him is what we have been told, but he did say it would take force to fracture the jaw. This has been 2 weeks since he was injured at school and the school refuses to disclose what happened except to say that there was a staff member that has been placed on leave pending an investigation, but we have no idea what this staff member role was. Besides calling the school and talking to the principle, what else can we do? This is in Duval County.",legaladvice,t3_dkqhob

"NY: Former employer purposely hid major health plan changes. I now owe money to doctors and can't pay. 

I'm located in NYC.

I'm on COBRA - the plan year started Jan. 1 2019 and was suppose to renew on Jan. 1 2020. There's no in-network deductible and I reached the out of network deductible in April 2019 so I now get 100% reimbursement for about $5K in medical expenses monthly. I have a serious life-threatening illness and I have doctors' appointments three times a week minimum. 

In August, I noticed my claim payments after July 1st were being unusually delayed. I called my insurance carrier who stated this was due to my former company rebuilding the plan. I reached out to the company's benefits manager via email and she replied that there some backend process changes, but no changes to the health plan. I eventually received full reimbursement and thinking the issue was fixed, continued with appointments in September and October.

However, I just discovered my deductible was reset to zero on September 1st. Without my knowledge I was charged the full deductible and co-insurance, leaving me holding the bill for $2000 in unpaid doctors' bills. I can't afford them and I will probably need to end service this week.

I found out that my former company changed the plan's coverage date from Jan. 1 to July 1, 2019. They then cut off the deductible year in September and didn't tell anyone. I asked the manager why she didn't tell me about the changes when I asked or disclose the changes to the plan prior to July 1st. She stated she found out after we spoke and they didn't tell anyone because this only affected the out of network (which is not true) and very few people go out of network.

That's insane.

I already spoke to the Dept. of Labor and they needed to provide notice within 60 days the change went into effect. DOL doesn't penalize, but It's also a major violation of the ACA - and is considered a criminal act because a major change to the deductible period was intentionally not disclosed. They're also required to provide a summary benefit plan and the didn't do that either.

A lawsuit will be hard because I signed a release for severance. And it makes no sense to hire a lawyer for 2K - and I don't need a lawsuit. I just need that money as soon as possible because certain medical services will be cut off soon.

My instinct is to write a calm and unemotional letter to the head of HR and explain the facts and that I need to be reimbursed this week. They know a lawsuit doesn't make sense. But does it make sense to say they're violating the ACA so they understand I mean business? Or will it just alienate them further?

Also, how do you report ACA violations? I only get directed to OSHA - and that only provides whistleblowers protection from employer retaliation, but I'm on COBRA. How do you report a violation like this?

This is not an issue for appeal. My insurance did everything they could and knows the company is wrong. They aren't responsible for notifications - the employer is. This is about nondisclosure to plan participants and I need to deal directly with them.",legaladvice,t3_dknylf
"Work is trying to fire me for having an allergic reactionFirst time using reddit but I’ve heard how you guys can be a great community to go to for help. Little background , I have strong allergies to perfume and bleach and they can cause me to go into anaphylaxis. Work is aware and although they claim to try to “accommodate” me they will not post any signs or institute a “fragrance free” policy like other similar medical offices. Last year after a reaction I ended up in the ER and work would not let me back “for my own safety” and after getting a lawyer involved it took 3 months before they allowed me back, all going unpaid.

My new problem is that I had another reaction last week, this time caused by pure negligence. All my coworkers are aware of my condition and have been educated and one of them decided to spray large amounts of perfume in a common area without any warning. I immediately went into anaphylaxis and was taken by ambulance to an ER. 

Occupational Health is once again claiming that they cannot guarantee a “safe” environment for me and are now looking for ways to fire me.

"Mum can't seem to get widow pension after dad's death (almost a year) because the solicitor has been postponing due to this reason or that (UK). 1 year seems excessive. Please, please help. Is waiting this long normal?TL;DR - Solicitor has dragged out inheritance process for a year for various reasons, advising non-native mum to not apply for widow's pension yet. Savings running low, and I'm getting frustrated on her patient behalf

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My mum's husband (my step-dad) passed last year in November. She and I came to the UK to live with him after they got into a relationship in another country. So my mum has lived here with him for 20 happy years. After he passed away, mum had no idea what was in his will as he never talked about it. It seemed that she inherited the house, which she was happy about, but considering she has no other ties here in the UK, she might leave it to his children and go back to her hometown.

The main problem is the inheritance money he left for his whole family. She is in charge of contacting the solicitor - of the organisation my step-dad was a long-time client - and making sure the inheritance gets handled properly and will be in safe hands. It has been a whole year now, and absolutely nothing. She has been calling relentlessly, and the solicitor will come up with one reason or another as to why it's not done yet. But always with promises of ""just a little more to go"", ""just a week / fortnight left"" and ""I'll be in touch with you next week to update you"" - none of which have been true, and she has managed to drag it out for months and months. I am severely frustrated and so is everyone around my mum, but she insists we shouldn't raise a fuss yet as she believes it will all be done in due time and we should be patient. I can't help but think this woman is taking advantage of my non-native mum. But for what reason?!

Mum is living off of her savings (she is not working anymore due to age and illnesses), but of course they will be running out, and she is getting worried. She has been advised not to submit the Bereavement Benefit form yet until the solicitor has completed the inheritance process. Are they really doing their best, like my mum believes? Or are they taking some kind of advantage? The false promises every day, lack of contact and updates, and excuses (like when mum calls in a day after the solicitor missed their scheduled phone call, and the receptionist claims that ""she's (suddenly?!) on holiday for 2 weeks, so will call when she's back"". What can we do?

"Contract does not specify notice of leave timeHi all,

I am on a trial period at my job until 31 Dec, however, I would like to quit now. My contract only specifies that AFTER my trial period ends do I need to give 8 weeks notice. Can I give them however long I'd like since it's not specified? Ideally, I'd like to give them 3-4 weeks now.

To clarify further:

On page 1 of my contract, underneath trial period:

“Your trial period will last from the date of commencement of your part-time employment to 31 December 2019… *The period of notice that you are required to give during or after the trial period is set out in clause 1.1 (Termination of employment).*”

However, when you go to the Termination of employment section as stated above:

“*The period of notice required to terminate your employment during or at the end of the trial period is set out at clause 5 (Trial Period) above.* **After satisfactory completion of the trial period** (as determined by the Company), and subject to clause 13.3 below, the notice required by the Company to terminate your employment will be 8 weeks' written notice”

Only **after** my trial period does my contract state I need to give 8 weeks’ written notice. My contract refers to two places in the contract where the period of notice for my trial period should have been written, but these two places simply refer to each other and do not provide a specified time period.

So can I give them 4 weeks if I'd like? Thank you!

"Sexually harassed at work.Hi reddit, so I’ve been dealing this with a few months now but it hit a point over the weekend where I realised something needed to change or something was going to go wrong. Let it be said that I worked the doors of night clubs for years and had similar issues but nothing that continued like this so I’m not sure if I’m being pedantic.

For the last few months I’ve been working the fresh produce at a large supermarket chain in Melbourne, Aus. Shifts are crap and I mostly work nights so it’s not a job I’m dying to hold onto.

One of my superiors on these night shifts had always been a bit of a flirt asking me what I’m doing after work etc. but to the point where I had to stop being polite and say I really wasn’t interested. Then he started referring to me as his bitch on the shop floor in front of other staff and customers to the point where it wasn’t even cheeky but just awkward and would make me super uncomfortable so I again shut that shit down.
So this past Friday night rolls around, It was my birthday on Saturday and some people at work knew about it. He caught wind and spent most of Friday night creeping up behind me and asking what “we’re” doing later.
I lost my shit though when it was the end of the night I was loading the cool room in the back with no one else around. When he walks in and goes in for a hug and a kiss like we were hiding some passionate love affair.
I stepped back and lost it. He said something like he was only play fighting or something like that and I told him I would’ve punched him either way, it ended with him apologising and me leaving before I’d wrapped up my work. I just have this gut feeling that this really isn’t the end.

Sorry if that all reads as a bit of dribble, I’m not the most articulate person and I’m on mobile.

I was assured that my card would be refunded, and thought everything was done with. A week and a half later, the charge was still not refunded to my card. I’ve been calling for the past 2 days, getting bounced around between customer service reps, and they can’t seem to figure out how to refund my card. I’m not even their customer! They refuse to let me speak to a supervisor, instead they just keep making me explain myself to a different rep every time they are sick of dealing with me. I just want my money refunded.

"Is my Oregon attorney just unprofessional or unethical?My first time dealing with the legal system and court (received a DUII and reckless driving in Oregon) and I did not qualify for a public defender. My attorney was recommended to me from the state bar website. I can most certainly say that I got a poor recommendation and my attorney is not doing what should be expected from her. However, I’m not sure if it’s just laziness and unprofessionalism or if some of her behavior is beyond that. The two issues that I am most concerned about are the following: After I hired her, she requested an extension on my court date so she could have time to review the police report and other documentation. The week prior to my initial court date, she had her teenage daughter call me to update me on the situation. By teenage, I mean 16 at the oldest and not someone who is an official member of her staff, such as a secretary. The child introduced herself as “attorney’s daughter” and then stumbled through the call with my attorney in the background telling her what to say and correcting her several times. The next call I received from my attorney, she explained that she was driving so she had her daughter make the call and she even laughed about how awkward her daughter was on the call.

My other issue is that my attorney continuously tells me about her other existing cases. She never mentions names, so maybe that makes it okay? She has detailed to me three different cases. Most recently, she had been out of town for a case and when she returned, called me to notify me why I hadn’t been able to reach her. She detailed the case, telling me what town/court it was, what charges were held against her client, that the client was from out of state, and how long they were able to extend the court date for. She ended the story with, “I guess that just keeps them out of jail for a few more months” while laughing about it.

As someone who has never dealt with lawyers before, I don’t know what to think. She has portrayed a long list of unprofessional behavior that I am disappointed in but these two instances leave an especially bad taste in my mouth and I am not sure what to do about it. On our first meeting, we found out I used to work for her mother and I’m worried by this behavior that she is telling her mother or other people about my legal issues when she should not be. Please tell me I’m being paranoid and looking too far into these issues. Or maybe I’m not and you all have some advice? Thank you!",legaladvice,t3_dl1gq0
"Could somebody help me with the conclusion of a corporate law case Im currently studying?&gt;In January 2002, Alex, a business consultant, won a lucrative contract with Ball Company to provide them

provide the necessary computer hardware and a third one was with Eric to write a manual explaining the
operation of the new system. All of these tasks were to be carried out by 23 rd May. Chris, Martin, Eric were

increase his payment by a further 1000 pounds. Alex agreed to pay the increased sum in order to ensure
that the job was done on time. However he thought it was only fair that he should increase the money
promised to the others, so he promised them a bonus of 1000 pounds, if the job was done on time. At the

"HELP: Getting caught cheating by University?I’ll preface this by saying I understand the advice I seek doesn’t actually pertain to American Law; rather I’m looking for principle-or experience-based advice from people who are familiar with court. 

I go to a very large, public state research university in the United States. I’m a STEM major, so some of my lectures can get pretty packed with kids. Several weeks ago, I took an exam in a lecture hall of ~100 people, and roughly the same number of seats (meaning we were all packed in like sardines). I had been up all night studying, was still feeling an Adderall buzz, and had 4 more classes immediately after that; needless to say I was a little restless. I felt pretty unprepared and jittery so I was glancing around A LOT, including at my neighbor’s papers. Nevertheless, I answered the questions (I thought) on my own and received a half-decent grade a few days later. This was October 5th. Last night, my professor emailed me saying “I was observed violating the Academic Code” that day and i would “likely be hearing from them soon.”


I know there’s a lot to unpack here, but I am extremely worried. If I get punished, I will receive a permanent F in the class and will subsequently be kicked out of my entire major (I’m a junior now). I need to know how much of a case they have if the only evidence is my repeated glances around me, which may be on video due to some lecture hall cameras. If anyone is familiar with academic cases/university judicial practices, PLEASE let me know. My entire future is at stake.",legaladvice,t3_dl1bz2
"[CA]No window locks, mold in water heater, angry tenantHi,

I moved into an apartment August 1 with my wife and baby, and we've had nothing but problems.

After moving in, we noticed that none of the seven sliding windows locked in our ground floor unit--wooden dowels were used instead. It took **56 days** after notification for a repairman to be sent, who showed up with a handheld vacuum and cheap [window stoppers](https://imgur.com/TE1OXRz). These were screwed to the window tracks, creating the annoyance of having to unscrew them to open the windows and then reattach them when wanting the windows closed. Frankly, I'm uncomfortable using them because I believe they create an unnecessary fire escape hazard as they aren't quick release.

The other big one is disgusting and infuriating. After the first time using the washing machine there was a horrible smell of rotten eggs. We notified management, they sent someone to fix it, and told us it was fixed. We used the washing machine a second time, it still had the horrible smell, and again someone was sent to fix it, and again we were told it was fixed.

The third time using the washing machine, some of our baby's clothes looked as if mold had seeped into them. A plumber was sent, who found that mold was growing in the hot water heater, told us that the water was contaminated, and we should probably throw away our clothes, *especially* the baby's clothing.

By now we're furious. Our baby has been wearing this stuff, we're talking at \*least\* $1k between clothing, bedding, burp rags, etc., and yet the property management has said the property owner isn't responsible for the clothing and we should submit a claim with our renter's insurance. We have a $500 deductible and don't see how this is our responsibility.

At this time I started poking around the law and learned that our unit was legally uninhabitable because of the window locks. Clearly IANAL, but my interpretation of other laws make it appear the property owner is **entirely** responsible for the damages to our baby's clothing.

So after 2.5 months, we just want out. We informed the property owner and have exchanged just a few emails of negotiation, but they're behaving like bullies, using the fact that my wife and I want to be out by the end of the month as she returns to work beginning of November. Their last offer was, ""as a courtesy,"" ending the lease October 31st but will offer no further compensation and no further consideration ""beyond that.""

I haven't yet brought up the law, and if we had more time, I'd dig my heels in and fight back because I believe the law is entirely on my side. So now, the questions:

* Do those window stoppers satisfy Civil Code 1941.3(a)(2): Install and maintain **operable window security or locking devices for windows that are designed to be opened?**
* Does the condition of the hot water heater and washing machine violate Civil Code 1941.1(a)(6):   Building, grounds, and **appurtenances at the time of the commencement of the lease or rental agreement, and all areas under control of the landlord, kept in every part clean, sanitary,** and free from all accumulations of debris, filth, rubbish, garbage, rodents, and vermin?
   * On this, does Civil Code 1714 (a) apply as it states: Everyone is responsible, not only for the result of his or her willful acts, **but also for an injury occasioned to another by his or her want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his or her property or person,** except so far as the latter has, willfully or by want of ordinary care, brought the injury upon himself or herself
      * Finally, Civil Code **1929** states: The hirer of a thing must repair all deteriorations or injuries thereto occasioned by his want of ordinary care.

If you're still with me, thank you, I'm just about done. The big question is **what can I do**?

I believe our lease was not signed in good faith, and breached by the property owner according to Civil Code 1942(a) which reads:   If within a reasonable time after written or oral notice to the landlord or his agent, as defined in subdivision (a) of Section 1962, of dilapidations rendering the premises untenantable which the landlord ought to repair, the landlord neglects to do so, the tenant may repair the same himself where the cost of such repairs does not require an expenditure more than one month’s rent of the premises and deduct the expenses of such repairs from the rent when due, **or the tenant may vacate the premises, in which case the tenant shall be discharged from further payment of rent, or performance of other conditions as of the date of vacating the premises.**

I'd be more than happy walking away and going to small claims court, but it's a gamble as they still have our deposit of 2x the rent. We haven't agreed to their offer, nor have we seen lease cancellation agreement, but to just accept their condescending ""courtesy"" makes my blood boil, while the clothes my baby has worn makes me vengeful.

Thank you so much!",legaladvice,t3_dklqke
"Accidental American - looking to renounce citizenship - what is my best course of action?Hello LegalAdvice,

I am under 18, will be 18 before the end of this year. I have just started working.

I have very recently become aware of the fact that I am an ""Accidental American"" - i.e I hold an American citizenship of which I had no idea of. I am in Australia, born to an Australian/American couple of which my father is American which is how I ""inherited"" the citizenship. I have an American Social Security Number.

I did some digging and I realised that not only do I have tax obligations even though I have never lived in, do not associate with or do not plan to travel to the US any time soon, I am also required to register for the draft.

I'm struggling to wrap my head around the process for renouncing my citizenship and any exemptions which may apply to me, I'm also looking to figure out if there are any tax related requirements I would have to meet before I am able to renounce my citizenship. Do I have to file any tax returns in the US before I am able to renounce even though I have never earned anything close to a taxable income? Is there any benefit to renouncing my citizenship before I turn 18?

If there is something simple that I can do to make sure we both stay employed, I would love to hear it. If that thing is nothing, even better. To questions:

1. While I am a fan of ""Shut the Fuck Up Friday"", is just the existence of any cannaboid product on the property clearance for the Feds to shred my life til they are satisfied I am just the loser I claim to be?

"Advice on Starting a Non-Profit that Won't Make Any MoneyI am a graduate social work student and am looking to start a non-profit program in my community for my final project. The program will look to address the issue of unemployment among people with autism (which by some accounts is between 70-90%). The program will be for high school-aged kids with autism and other challenges who want to gain work experience before they enter the workforce. The program will give them a better understanding of their needs and will help them get an idea what sort of jobs they could excel at. Imagine a lawn service, free to the public, where youths with autism can come and do the yard work while being coached and supervised by a social worker (that's not exactly the idea but that's the gist). I will be using my own money to get the supplies needed, but I don't expect it to cost a whole lot to run.

I'm a bit lost when it comes to which direction I should go. I'm leaning towards non-profit because I would love to apply for a grant. Other than that I'm pretty clueless, even after some extensive googling. Do I incorporate? Do I make it an LLC? Do I need insurance? I have no immediate plans to make money from this, but I could see myself opening a garden supply shop 5+ years down the road to sell goods for profit and to help supply and fund the program.

"(NJ US) My boss has vocalized to coworkers that they are intentionally treating me badly (shorting me on pay, overworking me, allowing sexual harassment to go undisiplined) because I am of a different social class and culture/race than them and they don't 'like' me. They are also comitting fraud.I would like to know what laws are being broken, what and how to document so that I might seek a lawyer, and what legal options I might be able to take against my employer suchas reporting them to the IRS. 

I will try to keep this concise.

I have been working the same job (line cook/garnier) for about 3 years. 
About 8 months ago our Sus Chef quit. The owner has made every excuse as to why they haven't hired anyone to replace the position (and a second position in back of house) leaving us short staffed and worked raw for nearly a year now.  In the meantime because I have the ability/experience to do so, I have been fulfilling all the tasks/responsibilities of the Sus Chef position. The employer has acknowledged verbally to me that they are fully aware that I am working the Sus Chef position but refuses to give me the title or pay increase and refuses to tell me why. The employer has said to other employees that it is specifically for classist/racist reasons (I am poor white trash and they are upper class Chinese, we are both female if that matters).

They have been shorting my pay significantly for the entirety of the time I have been with the company. How they do this is by paying me half on the books and half off the books. They have me work on average 45-55 hours per week, but do not pay me for overtime and only record/tax 20 hours per week. Everything over 20 hours is only recorded on my punch card (which I have photographed). 

This is tax fraud, correct? I have told the employer multiple times that I am uncomfortable participating in this arrangement and they have ignored me.

I have been sexually harassed (forcefully kissed and groped by an off the books dishwasher who was fall-down drunk on the job at the time) threatened and bullied by 3 different male coworkers (I am female) over the last 3 years. These incidents were all on camera and all had witnesses. When I brought it up to the employer nothing was done. No diciplinary actions were taken. It has been allowed to continue on a near daily basis for over 6 months straight. 

I have diagnosed PTSD/anxiety disorder due to my nervous system having been both physically and psychologically damaged in an incident where a stranger attacked me while yelling sexist slurs and  nearly killed me/tried to kill me (I have a permanent physical injury do this) .

When I had a string of severe PTSD attacks at work due to the constant harassment and physical exhaustion I was finally forced to disclose this personal medical information to the employer.  The employer told me- and this is a direct quote- that I am 'weak' that my illness 'is not real and is just weakness'. I told them that it is real, that my nervous system is physically damaged and I am under the regular care of a doctor (twice per month) because of it and have medical records to prove it. 

My employer is also aware that I have been homeless since April because even working well over full time, they are not paying me enough for me to afford rent anywhere within an hour commute. They have been stringing me along all summer claiming they will soon 'fix my pay'. They have told me this 4 times and never actually done it. 

What can I do? I am definately going to leave the job (as are many of the other employees, for similar reasons) .

Can I leave a voice recorder going in my pocket and try to get the boss to say these things directly to me? 

If so, what are some example questions I might ask, do I need to use specific wording or get then to say specific words?

I understand I likely have no recourse to recover all the overtime I have not been paid for, or to press charges for the harassment/discrimination. That sucks, but it is what it is.

I would, however, like to report the business to the IRS and/or any other appropriate tax or labor rights organizations. Honestly, I would like to do everything in my power to destroy the business so they can't do this to anyone else in the future. 

I have not quit yet and the boss is never around. So, I can photograph time cards etc as proof of all the off the books workers. What should I photograph? What can I legally document?

I have multiple coworkers who are witnesses to my claims and/or have had the same done to them.

Should I contact a lawyer/attorney? If so, what type?

Thank you in advance and I appologize for formatting. I am on mobile.

Please let me know if I should edit in any further information.

Edit: I would also like to know if recipes are considered 'intellectual property'. The restaurant uses a couple of my original recipes on the menu. These did not come from books or the internet. I made them up myself. I can prove there are no identical recipes online by simply googling it. These dishes are very popular. Can I force them to not use my recipes once I quit? Also, can this be used as proof that I am infact doing the job of sus chef while being paid the rate of an entry level inexperienced cook? Chefs make recipes for menus, cooks just do what the chefs direct.

Edit 2: I also am not allowed breaks. I work on average 9-10 hour days and sometimes as much as 14-16 hour days with no breaks. I have never once been given a break in the 3 years I have worked at this job.

I also basically cannot take days off. We have been so short staffed for about 8 months that if I call out it hurts my coworkers. I care about them, so for example today I woke up with a fever and stomach problems but have been on the clock for 9 hours already with 2 yet to go. There are 3 of us working a line/menu designed for 5. All three of us are working a double and there is no one to call in for relief. This *has* to be illegal? Right?

My therepist thinks this job situation is affecting my health. My massage therepist (I go for pain management due to a permanent injury) thinks there is an injury to my right shoulder caused and perpetuated  by the shoulder being injured and than overused/not allowed to heal due to my job.

Around Sept 15ish I went to a furniture store near my house(went there with my dad previously, he bought a few items).  The reason I came back is I was previously offered the next time I come and order something if the total is over $2k he would take $200 off.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a bedroom set, a mattress and a sofa set.

The total came up to 3400.  My wife and I put down about 650\~.  The salesrep(we found out hes the manager) agreed on a Oct 20th delivery.  We said we would co.e back this coming Wednesday and put down another 1000.  No issues so far.  Come Wednesday I had to work late next few days and I was busy at work.  Didnt get out till after store was closed.

&amp;#x200B;

He called friday to ask about the payment.  I apologized profusely for being negligent.  He said no issue, just come I  tomorrow and pay the money.

&amp;#x200B;

Go in Saturday, pay what we could to bring the total down to $2500.  It wasnt the $1000 promised but he said that shouldnt be an issue as long as we paid by delivery day which then we both confirmed to be the 20th.  I then take a look at the invoice (should have done this way before, but as my wife kept the invoice I was unable to).. I asked him about the discount he previously mentioned.  He said not an issue he would talk to his boss and get that added.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, he said was busy so we paid with a different sales rep. We again confirmed with him that we were still set for oct 20th delivery.  He said yes of course.  I also told him next payment would be close to the delivery day as we have some renovations going on and I would be super busy to come in to pay. He said that's quite alright.

&amp;#x200B;

He then called the owner over and said what a lovely family we were, and started ranting about how my dad came and bought somethings and how I came now and that we were so lovely... lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to oct 19th.  I go in with pretty much the full payment.  I ask him about the discount and he said not to worry he hasnt talked to the boss yet but he would.  I then said when would he talk to him as delivery is tomorrow oct the 20th.  He then said sir I'm sorry but we dont deliver on sunday.  I said but the previous two times I was in the 20th wasnt an issue.  He said I should have known they dont deliver in sundays no one does.

I told him how would I know as nothing was told to me.  He also said I havent even paid in full(another thing that wasnt told to me) and told me delivery cant be made unless paid in full.  I told him again this was never discussed.

&amp;#x200B;

I pulled out the invoice and showed him the delivery date.(so this is my big mess up) the date on our invoice was empty, nothing written.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him to pull his out and it showed some abbreviations with del atr ar.  No clue what that means but I'm sure he wrote that in after we left.

&amp;#x200B;

I asked him again why he wouldnt give us the full information.  He goes sir you should know this everyone normal goes to church on sunday no one works.  Which I found highly offensive as I'm Muslim and church on sunday is not a thing.

Though I ignored it.  He then pushed my daughter away as she went to him(he was previously very nice to her) so she went to say hi and play with him.

&amp;#x200B;

I got infuriated when he did that and said your an asshole. I then asked for a refund, to which he rectorted we dont give refunds sir you  should know that.

"Rarely allowed a meal break at workSo, a little backstory. I work at a McDonald's in Georgia since May of this year, and the managers and pretty much everyone else has been giving me a rough time. I have sugar issues and can be sick (vomiting, etc) for a whole DAY if I go more than 6 hours without eating anything at all.

So, my issue. I ask about halfway through my shift or whenever it's not busy if I can get a meal break. Most of the time they'll say ""no, we don't have anyone to cover your shift"". Sometimes they won't even allow me to eat a quick snack before returning to work. A week ago I watched this same manager allow every other service person on break except for me. These issues began almost two weeks after I began working there.

"What should I do to negotiate a title loan settlement? 

I have a title loan on a car for over $6,000. I’ve had it for over three years now and so have paid well over that amount back in interest (title loans charge interest rates per month, not per year, so I’ve been paying over $600 a month in interest only). I cannot keep paying money into the abyss every month like this.

I have read that with title loans you can do a settlement for a fixed amount to settle the loan and get your title back, for somewhere between maybe 25%-75% of the entire loan. My loan would be over $7,000 to pay back at once, since it would include that month’s interest payment too. With a settlement, I could resolve the loan for somewhere between maybe $1,500-$4,500 in a lump sum. I cannot afford the higher end of that but I could afford somewhere between $1,500-$2,500 (though the lower end of that the better, especially considering I’ve already paid probably over $20,000 to the title loan company).

I stopped paying the title loan over three months ago. I took precautions to keep the car from being repossessed from my driveway. I was expecting them to first default the loan (or whatever the correct term is), then try to repossess the car, then negotiate with me for a settlement. I was expecting it to be done and over with by now. 

After the first month, they let the total interest owed accumulate on a day-by-day interest rate up to two month’s total for the second month. One month is over $600 in interest payments, so it moved up to over $1,300 after two. Apparently they are allowed to let the interest owed add up to two month’s total at most, so after the second month they froze the amount owed but still didn’t default the loan as I’d expected.

When you are even one day late on a regular monthly payment, they contact you to tell you you need to pay asap plus the extra days’ interest or you’ll lose your car and they can only wait a week before that happens (and they say or imply that they’re giving you that extra week because they’re being nice). After that week, they say the same thing but add another week, and so on. After two months, they still did the same thing each week except they stopped mentioning exactly how long it’d been (just now saying it’s “way overdue”) and the total then stayed the same capped at two months’ worth instead of increasing any more.

After not hearing any settlement discussion from them, I finally brought it up myself without mentioning any particular amount or percent. They said under no circumstances would a settlement be possible now since I was so late, and that I’d have to catch up with my late payments first to even discuss any possible settlement. However, I have no faith that they would entertain a settlement offer if I did catch up first, and to “catch up” would be $1,300 alone when I’m hoping to settle for between $1,500-$2,500 total.

Another week went by and they called again (this was last week) and I brought it up again. At first they said the same thing, then they hedged and said, well if we were to do a settlement it’d probably be for over $5,000 which I said was too high for me for a settlement. I’ll be expected to talk with them again this week now.

This is the point I’m at. Every week this drags out the more nervous I get. I would like to hire a lawyer to help negotiate a settlement for me, but I’m afraid that would be much too expensive and even if it were somewhat affordable, would cut into the amount I could offer for a settlement.

What should I do now? What can they do and what are they likely to do? This was at a TilteMax store in southern GA near Valdosta, if that makes a difference.",legaladvice,t3_dl0s0q

She has a core team of 5 full-time, salaried employees for planning and production and she brings in freelancers as hourly contractors for day-of design, set-up, break down, etc. Everyone is paid above minimum wage.

Occasionally, her clients will tip following their event. These tips range from $50 up to $1200 dollars. There's no expectation or convention on tipping - some clients do it, others don't.

My wife was telling me that she takes the tips and adds them to a pot along with other misc cash income (for example, from selling off used vases, etc). At the end of the year, this pot is used to throw a Christmas party for her core crew and freelancers, for an end of the season spa day for her core crew and then as year-end bonuses for her core crew.

"Is what the 92 yo man at the dry cleaners said true?So last week I was at the dry cleaners dropping off a pair of pants. The clerk (a 92 year old man) started asking me questions like “how much is the national debt”  “who do we owe it to” and “how many people are there in China vs the US”. I’m a high school debater and the current topic is related to China and trade deals so I roughly knew the answers and he was surprised so he continued talking (for way too long). 

Apparently he asks these questions to everyone he interacts with to assert his superiority, as he said he asked a couple earlier and they didn’t know. He also goes to the bank around the corner just to antagonize the manager about economics. 

Anyways, after he’s done questioning me he tells me that he hasn’t payed income tax in 40 years because he took the IRS to court and without hiring a lawyer, he singlehandedly defeated them after an epic battle using only the constitution as that’s the ‘real law’, not the statutes and regulations that ‘they’ try to enforce because taxes are communist, communist manifesto, he’s a real american blah blah blah. 

He then goes on to say that since I seem like a bright young man, he’s going to pass on some secret information to me so that I’m not just another one of the masses. He writes down on a piece of paper “HJR 192” and tells me to look it up as it will change the way I think of things and it will ‘keep me up at night’. I looked it up out of curiosity when i get home and it’s just some law passed in 1932 that did away with the gold clause in the constitution and in all public and private contracts. He said this is some secret truth that the government is hiding from us and that him telling me this is planting a seed in the future of this country and that because of this law, people aren’t actually required to pay taxes.

 Ofc I don’t really believe him but it’s kind of intriguing tbh. So if any of y’all actually understand what HJR 192 is, is there any truth at all to what this old man was saying or was it simply the senile ramblings of a “real American” ?",legaladvice,t3_dkgjgd

"[IA] I'm being forced to pay rent for an apartment I don't have access to.Rented an apartment with a year lease. I was forced to re-up the lease May of this year because plans fell through and I wasn't ready to move yet.  
  
I served notice 30+ days in advance that I intended to break the lease and move because I started a new job over an hour away. They asked for the keys to be returned on the date I have, and I did. They would not advertise the apartment to be re-leased unless I paid a $350 advertising fee, so I did. They didn't actually update the listing with the correct availability time and date until over two weeks later when I pointed out that the listing was in error (showing the may 2020 availability). Now it's two months later and they claim to have shown the apartment to three people, and haven't had any takers.  
  
I want to point out that I always paid rent on time. I meticulously cleaned the apartment, repaired the dry wall where I hanged pictures.. I took excellent care of this place.
  
They said I would be ""eligible"" for my security deposit back after 30 days of the move out date but they are now dodging my inquiries about it. I've also been forced to pay the entire amount of rent for the two months that I've been completely moved out, and I'm expected to pay for November rent this week too.

I would like advice on how I can write a legal document acknowledging rental payment made to my deceased mother.

My mother (55) who was afflicted with autoimmune disease for 20 years, passed away in September this year. She was acting as an Agent for her elderly godfather and was collecting cash rent on his behalf before depositing into his bank account; she did this without pay for 8 years. However, her uncle passed away in March this year and his estate went to his Son Mr E. While they were getting his estate affairs in order my mom continued to collect rent for the months of May and June totaling $6,000 before becoming debilitated with illness herself. 
When my mom passed I inherited her estate, however her bank account totaled $4000. My mother did not have much to her name as my father stole her savings when he abandoned us, and was unable to work due to her health. She could not buy insurance due to her already being ill, and I suspect most of her finances was spent on medical bills. I lived with my mother and supported her financially.

Now Mr E is chasing the tenants and I for his $6000. I am aware that debts are not inherited and largely ignored him. However now, he is going after the tenants and threatening to deduct their deposits. Unfortunately my mom did not issue receipts, and since the tenants paid in cash they have no way to prove payment. These tenants have known my mother for years and I have no doubt that they did pay rent to my mother and would like to know if there is legal recourse to protect the tenants and take the heat upon myself.

"Planning violation on flat conversion, affected area on other flat but what is my liability as joint freeholderLondon, England

I am leaseholder with share of freehold of a maisonette which the previous owner converted from a townhouse.

As part of this conversion the planning stipulated that the front driveway was converted to a garden with turf and fence/wall. This was not done and we have owned the property for 6y.

At the turn of the year we got a visit from council planning dept saying that this work needed to be done as it was in violation. As the planning was against the original house it is against the freehold so I am supposedly part liable, however the land in question is wholly under their lease.

The landlady downstairs has made some attempts to solve this, but is stalling and going slowly and the council is now threatening an enforcement notice. She's also not being greatly communicative in the last couple of months.

My issue is that I'm not sure what I can do. The front drive is not my lease, so I can't unilaterally do the work. I also can't solely appeal (which I think we should do as the land is wholly inappropriate for a garden and rented gardens usually are very poorly maintained. There is also no space for the tenant to store any required tools). It's also not clear whether I have a financial liability. My lease stipulates that we share liability for structural issues, but this is non structural, however it is against the freehold.

"Is this fraud or something else illegal? (OH)I want to look into this before giving advice to my kid.  

At his school, there are a group of students who are making money in a way that I am concerned is potentially illegal, and want to know what kind of exposure he may face as a result of knowing about what's going on.  A group of students are making discord servers for popular games, getting people into the server, and then start charging for people to get various rights on the server.  Then, once they have cleared enough money, they close down the server and pop a new one up to rinse and repeat the process.  Basically, they are using the fact that people will shell out some cash for ""power"" on the server, and once the process dries up, they move on to another server.  I am light on specifics, but I would assume that this is all happening with some kind of online transactions.

So far, my advice was to just take it to his advisory at the school to let the school know about what is happening (as they are pretty serious about ethics, and him knowing about it without doing anything could even get him kicked out if the whole thing comes out), but I am really wondering if this also falls into some type of fraud due to the intent of the students to pop up these servers only to get the money and run.  And if it is illegal, would him not doing anything make him a possible accessory or anything that I need to be concerned about.

TL:DR - Is it illegal to pop up discord servers, charge for admin\\mod powers, and then close the server once the whales dry up, just to do it again on another server",legaladvice,t3_dkz16b
"NYS DMV License Points QuestionsI have a couple questions regarding the following statement (questions are at the bottom). I live in NYC and I’m 24 years old. 


“Once 18 months have passed from the violation date, the points for that violation no longer count toward your total. However, the points remain on your driving record as long as the conviction remains on your record and may be used by your insurance company to increase premiums.” - quoted from the NYS DMV website. 


Q1. Assuming the above statement is true, if I receive a conviction for 6 points 24 months after the violation, would i technically have to disclose that I have 6 points on my license if a potential employer asked how many points I have on my license, seeing as it surpassed the 18 months since the violation date?

Q2. Say I am issued various violations which add up to 20 points in 2016 alone, but my conviction dates are between 2018-2019 for all of them, and I am found guilty for all 20 points. Since it has been greater than 18 months since the violation date, but not 18 months since the conviction date, would I still have 20 points on my license?

Q3. Would potential employers view my ticket history as not receiving a ticket in 3 years, since last ticket was in 2016. Or, would they view my history as just convicted of a lot of tickets in the past 1-2 years, since conviction was 2018-2019?

I hope my questions weren’t confusing.

"Tenant just ate his wordsIn California. We have a tenant renting my house for two years (lease ends on Nov 3). On Oct 3, the tenant texted us, asking to extend the lease to late Nov, in his own words:
“I was about to contact you - we would like to vacate 15 days later by November 18th... given our new home is not fully ready. Can we start viewing from next weekend please”
And immediately we replied:
“Thanks for letting us know. We will just prorate in this case.”
Knowing the move out date is postponed by 2 weeks, we also okay’ed his request to postpone viewing by one week, and scheduled a few prospective tenants in next few weeks according to this new dates he gave us.
Today (Oct 20) the tenant texted us:
“We plan to move the weekend Nov 2-3. Will give keys Nov 4 Monday.”
This is totally unexpected and we told him if there is no one who can start on Nov 4 we still have to charge the prorated amount to cover the gap between the date he moves out and the date someone who moves in (if before Nov 18) or the date agreed upon (Nov 18).
I have a few questions and need some advice:
1) Is the text message (the tenant made a request and we approved the very request) considered “legally binding”?
2) The tenant argued he did not reply to the message to confirm after we told him about the “prorate”, therefore we are still on the Nov 3 star. He also claimed he did not want to pay us the prorate so he didn’t answer. Does this make sense and can he do that legally?
Much appreciated!!",legaladvice,t3_dkvkev
"[WI] My dog bit me, if I need to see a doctor, what can I expect by the way of law enforcement involvement, etc?TLDR upfront: my dog bit me when trying to cut his nails. He has had a fear of having his nails clipped since a puppy when he was hospitalized and the vet let an assistant cut his nails improperly, causing him to bleed on multiple nails. Would law enforcement be involved if I visit a doctor? If so, how? I have a fear of LEOs from childhood trauma and want to brace myself. Please let me know if there is a better sub for this. 

As a puppy, my dog had to be hospitalized for a day for what turned out to be growing pains. He was in puppy school at the time  and we were training on nail cutting so we were instructed not to cut their nails until we had worked through the acclimation. The vet decided to train their new assistant using my dog and she cut the nails way too short which caused them to bleed. They had to use something to pack into his nails to stop the bleeding, it was so bad. He has been fearful ever since. 

As he has become elderly, this has been more and more scary for him as his vision gets worse. I have worked all his life on training, and this was better for years, but in recent months I have had to use a muzzle. He slipped his muzzle last night and snarled at me, which resulted it a puncture wound. Normally he is the sweetest thing, this isn’t normal. He was being defensive. 

My dog will be turning 14 soon, and his siblings from the same litter (This litter was a rescue and a few of my friends adopted from it) have passed a couple years ago. I have been bracing myself for the inevitable since then. I’m not worried about putting him down as I know that is something that will have to be done as his arthritis and vision issues progress. This incident tells me that his time is near because he must have been in pain to do this. His arthritis has been getting worse. 

Now, I’m looking to brace myself for what may happen if I need to see a doctor from this bite. I have a fear of law enforcement from being sexually assaulted by an officer when I was young. I get unreasonably nervous whenever I see an officer. Just the other day I was driving home from work when a light turned yellow a few car lengths before the crosswalk, I saw the light turn red just before I passed under it, and my heart began to race as I noticed blue lights in my periphery (turned out to be a car with blue LED around the headlights). I was worried I might get pulled over. I even pulled into a parking lot to calm down before driving again. I was only a mile from home. I know this isn’t healthy and I recently started  therapy to work through my anxiety. 

What I’m really asking here is what sort of contact I will have with law enforcement about this. My dog’s rabies shot and city license expired two months ago and I decided not to renew given he hates the vet and he likely has little time to live (I plan on in home euthanasia because of this). He also is to the point where he does his business right outside the door and wants to come back in immediately. He still plays inside but shows no interest in the five mile walks we went on when he was a puppy and adolescent. 

I’m open to any advice. I know this sub is restricted to legal, I’m open to contacting other recommended subs as well.",legaladvice,t3_dkrvxd
"[NM] My parents were pulled over by police with no probable cause. My stepfather is currently detained because of two IDs.My mother and stepfather were questioned by police after they pulled over, in my vehicle, to use the restroom. They were coming from Albuquerque to Las Cruces to give me back my car and my dog. 

The officer showed up behind them after they stopped. My step father was arrested because he had two ids. One with the name on his birth certificate and one that is currently his legal name. The officers pulled them over for no reason and obtained the IDs after searching through his wallet. They said they couldn't verify the IDs were real. 

The officers let my mother go after questioning if she was a US citizen, which they both are. She asked the officer if she could drive it back to me but he did not let her. 

My car is now impounded because they couldnt verify who's it was. I only found out after my mother called me. They left her in the middle of nowhere, along with my dog, and I had to go pick her up.

2. Call 10 local employers to set up flu clinics

"Dentist is charging me for services that weren't covered by insurance, after telling me they would be.Location: Asheville, NC

I recently moved to a new town. In search of a new dentist I called a practice near my new home. They asked me for my insurance details, confirmed I was covered and ""in-network"". We scheduled my fist appointment.

I arrived a few weeks later and handed them my ID and insurance card. They confirmed, once again, that I was covered and led me to the back to begin my examination.

About 20 minutes later, I'm in the midst of getting my initial dental x-rays done, when the practice admin (the same one who took my initial phone call, and also confirmed my details upon arrival) comes in and apologizes, they had made a mistake, I was not in-fact covered.

They asked me what I'd like to do, and I explained I couldn't afford to pay out-of-pocket, and so we agreed to end the appointment early and I would leave.

A few weeks later, I get a bill from them in the mail for ~200$. I assumed this was in error, and called to confirm. Once again, that same practice admin answered, apologized and told me it would be taken care of.

A month later (just a few days ago now), that very same practice admin calls me, and now explains that I would be responsible for the ~200$ and if I don't pay, they will send me to collections.

I told them to send me the bill in mail and that I would respond accordingly.

"$2,124 in bogus legal fees due to negligence*Location: Ontario, CanadaAll names have been changed to fictitious ones.*

**07/25/18** — Closing day; I get keys to condo.

**07/27/18** ⁠— I am given contact info for a man named Grey who works at OLD Property Management, Inc.

**08/01/18** ⁠— NEW Property Management, Inc takes over as new property management company and **sets my account up with the previous owners info**.

**08/06/18** ⁠— I drop two post dated cheques for August and September into property managers mailbox (made out to OLD Property Management, Inc). (*see* *emails\_1.pdf*)

**08/26/18** — I make contact with Elisha from NEW Property Management, Inc and ask about how to set up pre-authorized payments for condo fees. I don’t realize the post dated cheques I dropped off on 08/06/18 won’t be applied to my account.

**09/17/18** — Previous owner calls me, letting me know ***his*** account is being debited for condo fees. We both call NEW Property Management, Inc to find out what’s going on. **I’m told I can’t pay my condo fees until the issue is resolved with the previous owner**, but I should be patient because the transition from OLD Property Management, inc “has been difficult”. Nobody follows up with me.

**10/18/18** — I enter three months of “arrears” and a Notice of Lien is sent out, **addressed to the previous owner**. It is returned to sender as undeliverable. (*see* *emails\_2.pdf*)

**11/22/18** — I drop off payment for all condo fees owing along with a VOID cheque and the requested PAP form for setting up pre-authorized payments. I send an email to Elisha, letting her know I dropped everything off. **She replies the next day** confirming receipt. (*see* *emails\_3.pdf* *and* *bank\_draft\_original\_copy.pdf*)

**12/06/18** — A new Notice of Lien is sent out (presumably addressed correctly this time) for all condo fees since I took possession of the unit, **which were already paid on 11/22/18**. This NoL is sent back undelivered. (*see* *emails\_3.pdf*\*)\*

**12/17/18** — Lien is registered for December condo fees plus legal fees/interest. Note that in my email correspondence with Elisha, I specifically request pre-authorized payments be set up and provided her with all requested documents to do so. (*see* *emails\_3.pdf*)

**04/16/19** — While preparing taxes, I notice odd amounts coming out of my account for condo fees and immediately contact Elisha. Shaun the accountant contacts me saying they had not set my account up for pre-authorized payments (as I had requested) so they made manual withdrawals for Dec, Jan, Feb. He provides me with a statement showing $0 balance and says nothing else is required from me. (*see* *emails\_3.pdf*)

**07/22/19** — I find a letter in my mailbox demanding $2,124 or my unit will be sold. This is when I first became aware of the lien.

\---------------------------------------

The property management company and Board of Directors are both refusing to acknowledge any wrongdoing, claiming that I can't prove I dropped off payment when I said I did. I have a scan of the bank draft dated for the day I said I dropped it off, an email to the property manager letting her know I dropped it off, and an email from her the next day saying:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Thank you! I will ensure it is provided to the accounting department right away.

&amp;#x200B;

They say the email from the property manager is an acknowledgement of email receipt and not receipt of the bank draft/PAP/etc. Now I'm forced to pay the lien and take this to small claims for damages. What would a judge likely think of this situation?

We do not have kids. I pay 100% of the mortgage payments. She does not work. We have not yet filed for divorce.

2-3 weeks ago, she told me that she cannot move out to an apartment or other housing because it would be ""house abandonment"" and she would be giving away her rights to her equity in the house. She said she was told this during a free consultation with an attorney.

I do not want her to be chained to this house, especially since she gets very sad here. However, we are reaching a point where we are both suffering here as we transition toward separate lives (ex. I come home late from dancing, being with friends, etc.).

1. If I stay over at my friend's place, is there a risk of losing my stake in our house -- for example, if I were to stay for a week, or a month, or multiple months? 
2. If one of us seeks out an apartment, applies, and moves into it, would this constitute house abandonment?

"I filed a report against my roommate for weed, can they tell her I filed it?I want to preface this by saying I'm in a hurry, so it won't be the prettiest and informational post.

University in TN, USA

So, my roommate originally didn't move in until the day that classes started, which was after the period in which we could change rooms if we wanted. About two or three weeks after, she starts to skip class and bring weed and boys into our room. The boys, I had no problem with, but I'm allergic to the THC in weed. It makes me nauseous, I throw up, have a headache, sometimes I can't even breathe. I told her this the first few times, but she never listened and I just gave it up, leaving the room when she started doing it.

Last Tuesday, I decided enough was enough. Our room always smelled like weed and cigars, and I was highly worried that if police services found out, they'd convict me too. I'm a 4.0 GPA, 30 ACT, A student even in college. I study every single night, and I never skip class. I'm the first to go to college in my family, and I worked far too hard for some lowlife, crackpot whore to ruin it for me.

I filed a report, went to Drug and Alcohol services, and gave them this long rant about how she wouldn't stop smoking and bringing weed into the room even after I told her it makes me sick. I sent them multiple pictures of videos of her rolling blunts, having bongs, and using vapes/smoking cigars. (I know taking videos of her is in itself illegal, but they actually told me to do that) I thought I finally had her out of my life; they'd kick her out of the dorms without refund at the lowest form of punishment, or expel her without refund entirely.

But, yesterday she disclosed to me that someone had reported her and that she has a hearing today in which she is given the right to know who filed the report. Is this even legal? What about my rights? As a person? As a student? (On a side note, I'm absolutely paranoid that she's going to beat my ass when she finds out and we meet again, so I've taken every precaution to take all my daily essentials with me to class so I can possibly stay out of the dorm until night.

We tried to find subletters but we're unable to because our landlord wouldn't respond to us. In the end we told the landlord we were leaving, and headed out. We never heard from them again. This was roughly 4 months into a 12 month lease.

Apparently shortly after they set up a court date (we were never notified), and because we didn't know about it we weren't able to represent ourselves and our landlord won the case.

I honestly never even considered the idea that the school had been negligent or anything until I got this letter, and after doing some reading on the subject, my unprofessional opinion is that the school doesn't seem liable. This is my only child, if I had throught the school was in the wrong, I'd have said something! Kids trip, running kids trip hard. 

&amp;#x200B;

My questions are: 

* Will the insurance company go after the school? I'm going to have to have a relationship with these people for the next 6 years, I'd really rather it not start out this way. 
* Should I contact the school at all? 
* Am I making this out to be a bigger deal than it is?

Thank you, hopefully I'm worrying over nothing.",legaladvice,t3_dkmkt0
"Ontario, Canada: can landlord or original tenant evict me if I have a pet?So I subletted a room for the school term, and initially my cat was supposed to stay at home with my family. So I didn’t mention a cat living on the premises when I subletted the place. However, it’s becoming hard living apart because my cat and I are very attached, so I want to bring him to live with me. (I’ve done it before but the sublet agreement then said pets are allowed.) 

Are there any legal consequences that can arise from this? There are no “no pets” clauses in my sublet agreement with the original tenant and from what I know, landlords can’t discriminate against pet owners. I know if the pet causes excessive odour, noise etc., then the landlord has grounds to evict but I don’t think that’ll be an issue with my cat. 

On that note, in the future do I need to disclose that there will be a pet living on the premises prior to renting? I was talking to somebody and they said that even though they’re not supposed to discriminate, landlords will just find a different renter without telling you the actual reason. 

Thanks for the advice!",legaladvice,t3_dkzzv6
"Noisy upstairs neighborsI've recently come to realize that my upstairs neighbors create so much noise that it's impacting my ability to sleep and do schoolwork, or even have a quiet thought. It's not really their fault either. It's not music or partying, just them walking, moving furniture, talking, babies crying, etc. However, it often occurs until after midnight, and is a near everyday occurrence. When my landlord turned this house into units, it seems they put the bare minimum thickness of walls and ceiling to maximize the interior space, but it's seriously starting to impact my ability to live in peace.

Do I have any ammunition in discussing terminating the lease early with my landlord? I've begun recording the sounds in my apartment as well. Could I be in trouble for recording one of their conversations I can clearly here from my basement apartment?

"Police officer (undercover ) accused me of speeding 40km faster than the speed limit in a 60 zone. Completely false, and according to him by observation. ( Victoria Australia )So I passed what I didn't know was an undercover police car. He was at the stop lights and they had just turned green so I went around him while maintaining my speed. Now it is possible that I had sped up to 5-10km above the limit. However my Speedo is about 5km off aswell ( tested with a Speedo ). 

The police car at the time followed me about 150 metres and tailgating me with no siren or lights and after I turn the corner he then pulled me over. 

I was completely shocked as I had no idea what i was being pulled over and then he hits me with some bullshit number saying 30-40km over. I asked him did he get that on the radar ? He said no, it was an observation. I said I definitely wasn't going that fast and perhaps it seemed that way because he has just taken off from the lights and I went past him making it seem like that.  He then said that I was questioning his intelligence and that I flew past him doing 30-40 I'm over. He said I was doing 100 which was absolutely false. 

He said if I had not given him attitude he would have given me a caution and told me to continue my night. I had not given him any attitude, I was just shocked and confused as to what he was trying to tell me. 

He comes back, no written ticket or anything, takes my address and such then comes back and says I'll have a penalty sent in the mail. 


I'm at a complete loss on what to do here.  I got caught speeding once and lost my licence for three months and recently got it back so am in no rush to lose it again especially for something I'm sure I didn't do.

"Dog Court - Dog Defending Against Another DogI live in Washington State. My dog is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier/Bullmastiff mix (aka, not a pitbull. He is a bully breed, though.) my boyfriend took him outside to potty and they were headed back inside, with my dog on the leash. A woman with a cattle dog was walking down the sidewalk, when her dog saw my dog. Her dog became aggressive and lunged forward. My dog attempted to defend himself, by grabbing the back of the dog’s neck and holding him there to avoid being bitten. Her dog got a light bite on my dog’s wrist, but her dog did not sustain any injuries. Another passerby had to come take control of her dog, as her dog was going wild and knocked her off her feet after the dogs were seperated. She told a 911 operator twice, as well as an animal control officer both dogs were leashed, and she did not wish to persue. Two days later, however, I’m issued a potentially dangerous dog notice and am told she wishes to persue because she claims my dog was off leash. The notice I was given has an incorrect breed that was not confirmed with me, my boyfriend’s name as they did not confirm with us who the actual owner is, no description of my dog or a microchip number despite asking me if he was microchipped (he is), and no case number. I am planning on appealing it, but I need advice on what to bring and if this notice is even considered complete, due to missing information. I am bringing photographs of him with another dog playing, a photograph of him focusing on me with another dog in the background, statements from a Petco groomer I bring him to regularly, a statement from a trainer who has been working with us for a year, as well as documentation of his injury and a statement from his vet. I also have confirmation I purchased a license for him. Am I missing anything? Will this even fully go to court with the missing/incorrect information, as well as her story changing two days later?

"Class action lawsuit over a car accident?Hello, (23/F) GA, U.S.A
So at the beginning of May I was involved in a car accident that was my fault. I was taking a left onto a busy road and there was a blind spot.  The speed limit is fast for the road making it harder to predict when cars are coming. I did not see them at all. I ended up side swiping a car as I was turning while going about 15-20 mph. Not fast, but they over corrected hard in shock and spun out of control hitting (and in some cases totalling) 7 other cars.

I was borrowing my step-dad's car during this accident. 
It was a horrific accident. I was in complete shock at the scene and probably seemed emotionless/apathetic. Damage to my car was minimal. A headlight and a new front bumper were needed. It was drivable after. The impact itself was hardly felt by me. 

My step father recieved a letter that a class action lawsuit is being filed against us. There is insurance on the car and there was at the time of the accident.

The letter was vague. I am not sure what to expect from this and am terrified. Neither my step-dad or my mother make much money or have paid-for assets. I myself am a college student and make on average 8-12k a year. Neither of my parents have money saved for retirement and will likely work their entire lives. 
To my knowledge no one reported any injuries at the scene. Though I know they still may have afterward.

"What to do with the vehicle of a deceased relative? [California]My father passed away recently, and the only real property he left behind was his work van. We are unsure how to handle it because of several problems:

1. We cannot find the title!
2. It has over $2,000 in late registrations fees. My dad was a courier, and so he had to register his van as a commercial vehicle. Several years back he developed a rare disease in his leg which prevented him from working. He apparently paid the registration for at least a year after that, but didn't change the registration type. His condition worsened and the van was neglected for several years. The registration fees stacked up quickly.
3. The van has some minor issues; the main obstacle is that it is a Sprinter van, and the parts are expensively imported from Mercedes. 

We are not sure the best way to proceed given the circumstances. Ideally, we would like the keep the van, although we do not have much cash on hand. It would be nice to get the fees reduced somehow.

My questions are:

1. Is there any protocol for waiving fees in a case like this where the owner became disabled and was unable to drive; let alone work?
2. What is involved in taking over the ownership of a deceased relative's vehicle?

"Questions about visitation and contempt of court motionThrowaway because I don't want these questions to be associated with my regular account.

State of North Carolina. 

I have a lawyer but he is vague and non-commital in explaining what is likely to happen in court.  I'm hoping you all can tell me how courts typically respond to certain issues. 

Background: I'm a grandmother with legal visitation with my 5-year-old grandson, who I will refer to as A. A lived with me for 2 full years as a kinship care placement, but two years ago I lost custody to his father who previously had not been involved in his life. His father, I'll call him B, lives about 6 hours away, in South Carolina, and I am court-ordered to meet him half-way at 6:00 pm every other Friday and Sunday. When A visits, I am required to supervise his visitations with his mother, who is my daughter. To be clear: I have legal visitation in my own right, as NC law allows for grandparent visitation under a narrow set of circumstances, which I met.  I also have full custody of A’s half-sister whose father is dead.

A was conceived when B cheated on his long-term girlfriend, who I will call C, with my daughter. C did not know about A's existence until DSS subpoenaed B for a DNA test; B knew about A and knew that it was possible he was the father, but he chose not to act on it, presumably to maintain his relationship with C. My sense is that now B&amp;C would like to just be a nuclear family with A and leave my daughter and me out of the equation. C has two other kids from two previous marriages who also live with them.

Over the past two years, B&amp;C have increasingly encroached on our visitation time using various excuses, like that their work schedule interfered with the drop-off so we have to meet later on Friday. Or that 6:00 on Sunday is too late too meet because A needs to be in bed by 8:00 so we need to meet at 4:00 instead. Or that C's other kids have some activity that they need to attend to so other arrangements have to be made. You get the picture. I have generally been quite flexible because I just wanted to keep things civil, but the more I gave, the more they pushed, and on Easter weekend when they told me that we had to meet at 11:00 on Sunday because they had planned a family Easter dinner, I pushed back. It didn't go well. In the end, they relented, but only after I threatened to take them back to court to enforce the order. 

Then, over the summer, they went MIA, and would not respond to any of my texts or phone calls. We missed multiple visitations because of their ""disappearance."" My lawyer sent a letter threatening to file a motion for contempt, and the following week B sent me a ""we haven't heard from you in a while - what's going on?"" text. I calmly told them that I didn't appreciate their disappearance, but they pretended that they hadn't gotten any of my previous texts or voicemails (their phone numbers had not changed). They said that A had been sick and could not visit that week so it took another full week (and missed visitation) before they finally agreed to meet for the next scheduled date, and even then, they cut our time short by needing to meet at 7:30 on Friday and 4:00 on Sunday. I didn't argue because I knew we would soon be back in court.

So my questions:

1. Is the judge likely to see through their claim of not receiving my texts and voicemails when they ""disappeared""? The fact that they reappeared only a week after my lawyer sent the letter makes it seem especially obvious to me that they are lying, but is a judge likely to agree?
2. If the judge does agree, how likely is it that he or she will find them in contempt of court, and maybe order them to reimburse my legal fees? Or is it more likely that the judge will just order them to follow the court order in the future?
3. B&amp;C constantly come up with reasons why A's visitations are bad for him, and they frequently claim that he has come home sick or injured. It's all complete bullshit. At one point they claimed that he came home with lice, even though no one at our house had it. They’ve also made claims about colds and bruises. Today they told my husband that Jacob always gets in trouble at school for hitting his classmates after our visitations; they want to know what's going on at our house that makes him violent upon his return. There is nothing bad going on at our house (we don't spank him); we always have a ton of fun with him, and he probably just has trouble with transitioning back. They nonetheless insist that it must be something we are doing wrong. But a judge will see through their attempts to demonize us, right? 
4. B&amp;C tell A to call C ""Mommy."" When A is at our house, I always refer to C by her actual name and A has told them that. At one point B asked me not to do that ""given everything C has      done for A."" I told him nope, that my daughter (as messed up as she is) is ""Mommy"" and C is not, and I will not refer to C as Mommy when talking to A. My guess is that the judge won't touch this issue either way. Am I correct about that?
5. Altogether, A has missed 6 visitations with us due to their game-playing. The court order says that those visits are supposed to be made up, but every time I've tried to schedule makeup visits, I've been      rebuffed. Is the judge likely to force them to make up the time? If so, is it more likely to be added to the summer, or as back-to-back weekends? Will I have any say about my preference? 

I know that there are no guarantees as to what the judge will do, but I am interested in knowing what I may reasonably expect. As I said, I've asked my lawyer, but he never gives me any straight answers. I trust him and have faith in his abilities (he's been good in the past), but his vague answers here are making me crazy.

"After 3 years leasing my car, I've been declined my right to buy it because it's not in the exact same condition of when it was new. Help. UKI'm an Uber driver and three years ago I signed this lease agreement that gives me the option to purchase the vehicle (for an extra 10k) at the end of the third year. The current value of the car is about 16k. The company from which I lease the car is acting very dodgy now they are finding excuses to not selling it. They told me that since I've been in an accident (a minor traffic collision), the car has sustained damages and it's not in the exact same condition of when I started the lease, this represents a breach of contract and they are refusing to sell it. I requested clarification but they are just ignoring or giving me a vague and confusing explanation.
The contract is quite long and articulate, but I can't seem to find the clause that I've been in breach of.
I've contacted a few solicitors, one suggested that he could write to them but he was not going to read the contract because sometimes the letter is enough. Another solicitor gave me a quote of 5-6k if I want to go to court...
In the three years period, I never missed a payment and the lease I signed only made economical sense if I would buy the car at the end, I feel outraged that they are trying to nitpick the contract to avoid selling me the car.

"No record of traffic infractionsHi,

About a month ago I received tickets from the Santa Clara county Sheriff's department for driving with an expired registration and an expired license. It was not suspended.

I got a ticket and he told me he was making the court date in november so that I could have time to get my license so they would dismiss the case (if you renew your license and show the judge they basically just dismiss the expired license charge).

I have a physical copy of the ticket but there's absolutely no record of the infraction or court date online. I've tried just going by my name, my driver's license, the case number, and the infraction number.

I also went through every case in the month of november and I have no court date at any point that month.

I thought maybe that the sheriff's citations went through their site instead of the county court site, but there is no place to search for traffic infractions on the sheriff's site.

The cop was very nice to me and I could see him not actually filing the ticket, but that's never actually happened to me before and I don't want this spiraling out of control just because I think the ticket doesn't exist.

Is there a way I can absolutely be sure this ticket wasn't filed and that I absolutely have no court case? I basically used ever possible way to search for it on their website and it doesn't exist. Do I need to go to a courthouse and have them confirm it in person?",legaladvice,t3_dktj51

I now have to pay about $300(2 visits) worth of counseling bills and have no way to pay it. I don't even have access to the insurance's online portal or my login details, *she* does. She herself admits she screwed up but refused to pay it or do anything. Our health insurance provider basically gave me the middle finger when I attempted to tell them the situation.

The counselor knew that I didn't make the appointment yet still ran with it. Throughout the two sessions(second I made because I thought it was free) I was then insulted by said counselor as he tried to insinuate that I was mentally insane.

I’m always jittery and have trouble speaking and understanding words being spoken to me, especially when under a lot of tension from the police. They told me to calm down as if I was having a huge freak out when I really wasn’t, and then proceeded to ask me two or three times why I look like I’m scared and if there’s something they should know about. I explained my conditions, but they acted like it was redundant to my reasoning for being jittery. Just a couple months later I was pulled over again, this time not for traffic violation but for a sudden movement I apparently made in the car at a red light and asked if I am stoned. Again, I act jittery and so my vehicle is searched and I do a DUI test, along with getting asked the same questions as last time.

He seemed like a good dude at first, I met him and honestly got along with him pretty well right off the bat. He moved into her apartment with her because they got along well and their relationship was going good. Things changed very quickly however, and she started seeing a side of him that wasn't apparent at all before. He started accusing her of sleeping around on him while she was at family functions or even just running to the grocery store. He began following her places and showing pretty classic signs of an abusive significant other. He physically and emotionally abused her. She asked him to leave her apartment and he refused, stating because he had his mail sent there now he was a legal tenant. She broke up with him, and they had a falling out. I went to her apartment with her, helped her box up his stuff, and called him. I had him come get his belongings, walk through the apartment and make sure nothing was left of his, and then walked him out of the apartment.

"Worker's Rights in MA?There's a lot of little parts to this situation, but at the moment my biggest frustration is that my current company (employee of about 4 months) has been making it very difficult for me to get any time off to recoup. I have brought it to their attention that Massachusetts law dictates a Day of Rest for every 6 days worked. The company has employees like me traveling 80+% of the time on back-to-back 2-3 day trips (which, in my view, was misrepresented to me during the interview/hiring process, e.g. they stated I would always have travel days as stand-alone days, and they have gradually had me fly/drive same day as work days more and more until now that's all I do), in addition to weekends that we are supposed to be able to take off so long as we've worked 1 weekend during the month (also misrepresented), and without real lunchbreaks. I have worked 2 weekends this month, with no weekday breaks between, for a total of 13 days of work, and they were giving me a hard time about taking next weekend off. I reached out to HR and they agreed that I should have some days off this week to compensate. and told me over the phone that they were concerned about the 6 days issue, plus the lack of lunchbreaks.  


As of a few days ago, they took me off of a trip so I could get a break in, only for me to see today that my ""break"" is still working in the office, just not traveling. At this point, I have a hard time believing they aren't being willfully harmful, as I have been stating my discomfort with driving while exhausted, having no true lunchbreaks, and my need for days off for my mental/physical health.

"Wife put under citizens arrest in CaliforniaStory starts yesterday, the neighbors below us have a dog, and they locked it in, so it was making a lot of noise as it did not want to poo inside. So we filed a complaint with the apartment, as this was not the first issue with the dog. Two o clock rolls around neighbor approaches me irate. His main argument is we should have talked to him first. My main argument is that his outright aggression from the gate, makes me think I did the right thing. Guy refuses to internalize anything or let me get a word in edge wise, and in fact says ""No"" when I asked if I could talk, so I said ""We're done here,"" and went inside.

Last night 2 am, agro guy decides to violently bang on his ceiling, our bedroom floor. He didn't persist because he knew he could only do like 5 bangs or I would have a recording.

Today we find out that they have filed many petty grievances against us. Tonight around 9 my wife goes out to make sure all the groceries are out of the car and the car is locked. She see's the neighbors girlfriend coming outside so she tries to have a civil conversation to smooth things over. GF is as agro as the BF.

I'm watching all of this from our landing above. Agro BF comes outside. Personal space becomes an issue very quickly, before I can fully understand what's going on, Agro BF is saying my wife pepper sprayed him.

Obviously after that both parties called the cops. I tell my wife, when stuff like this happens someone usually ends up in cuffs, good chance its going to be you, just be chill about it. Our interaction with the cops was almost enjoyable, and may I say those were some of the four most attractive cops I've ever seen. They leave to talk to the other people and come back, to  tell us that Agro guy is placing my wife under citizens arrest. No surprises there, dudes agro.

1. Obviously getting a lawyer
2. Obviously getting a restraining order on both of them
3. Probably going to move.

I would like to know a lot more about the citizens arrest. The cops said this guy is full on liable for this, but google and the links after have been super unhelpful. I would also like to know a little bit more about the nature of macing someone when you feel threatened. Thank you for you time!

"Writing a glassdoor review for a company, but concerned about defamationGreetings to the Lawyers of Reddit!

So a couple years ago, I had one of the worst interviews of my life. I'm very experienced with interviewing and take my own professionalism very seriously, and I'm also not usually the type to hold grudges... but this interview was so unbelievably unfair and unprofessional that I feel compelled to write about my experience on Glassdoor. However, before I could post, I found Glassdoor's page explaining defamation and I admit that it was difficult for me to comprehend. My understanding is that Glassdoor will protect people whose reviews are sued for defamation, but only to a certain extent? IMO, it makes more sense to just write a review that I can't be sued for to begin with, which is my goal. I'm also concerned because the CEO of the company that I'm writing about is literally a psycho and I wouldn't put it past him to try to find out who I am and sue me. However, I can't seem to drop this. I think the whole point of Glassdoor is to bring transparency to the nasty treatment employers dish out on applicants, and it's important to call it out. In fact, I also believe that racism might be involved, which is also why I want to post. 

With this said, I was wondering if anyone would be willing to spend a few minutes to explain defamation in accordance to this [Glassdoor article](https://help.glassdoor.com/article/Tips-on-writing-a-review-to-avoid-defamation/en_US/), in layman's terms? I read it through a few times, but I'm having a hard time making the distinctions. Or ideally, I already wrote my review - before posting about it on Reddit, I considered perhaps hiring a lawyer to proofread it before I post it. Is this something I could potentially contact a lawyer about? I have never hired a lawyer for anything before however and my knowledge on how to proceed in this situation is extremely limited, so any advice would be most appreciated.",legaladvice,t3_dkrmd0
"Out of state subpoena - victim in criminal case (WA / MD)TLDR: The State of WA vs Person. Superior Court of WA for King County. Vehicular Assault criminal case. Drunk guy drove through my fence years ago. State of WA says I'm a victim and emailed me a subpoena. I disagree with what they are trying to charge him with. I have moved to MD and was supposed to leave the country a few months ago. Can I get out of this?

I received a subpoena for the Superior Court of WA for King County. The plaintiff is The State of Washington. The defendant is a person. The charge is Vehicular Assault. I believe it's a criminal case.

Late one night a few years ago, I was pulling out of my driveway (in front of my house) with a friend and I heard a car crash. I drove around the corner and saw someone had flipped their car up on it's side behind my house. The car was smoking, so I called 911 and stayed back. My passenger and a neighbor helped the driver (who had gotten his head stuck in the door frame and was hanging by his neck inside the car). I stayed on the line with the 911 operator until the police and an ambulance arrived. We left to get my car out of the way and because we had no info to provide. I never saw the person in the car, but my friend was pretty sure he was dead. The next morning, I came home to find a giant hole where my back fence used to be and one of my trees had been hit and was covered with oil. No idea how neither of us noticed it the night before. A friend helped me replace my fence and remove the tree (which needed to be done anyway). My neighbors who also had damage said the driver was drunk and didn't have insurance or a license. They also mentioned that they had some people sleeping in a tent in their yard that night and they could have been killed, but luckily they weren't hit and were totally fine. They also said they stole cigarettes from the guy's car and went through his stuff... classy, eh? I never spoke to the police or anyone else about the incident.

Fast forward to this year (it's been two or three now.. I'm not sure): I sold my house and am temporarily staying with family on the other side of the country getting ready to go travel for the next few years. I have legally changed my address to Maryland. I start getting letters forwarded here stating that I will be receiving a subpoena because I'm a victim in a court case. I call the contact-person listed on the papers. She says I can't do a video deposition, but they'll cover travel and accommodation expenses. She asks if I know how to contact the people who were hurt while sleeping in the tent in the accident. I explain that as far as I know, no one was hurt and I don't have any contact info for my old neighbors. I continue to receive letters, now stating that a new date has been set and I'm still under obligation of the original subpoena that I never received. I reach out again and she emails me a subpoena. The court date has changed a few times and I'm having trouble continuing to put off my overseas travel plans now. I can't tell them anything other than that a car hit my fence and tree. For various reasons, this is starting to cause me a great deal of problems because I was supposed to leave the country months ago. I have no problem helping get a drunk, uninsured, unlicensed driver convicted, but I don't feel that I have any information that would help the state's case. If anything, I disagree with the charge.

Is it weird that no one has ever asked me a single question about that night, but I've been listed as a victim and subpoenaed? Is this subpoena enforceable? Is it possible to get out of this? Thanks for any insight you can provide.",legaladvice,t3_dkvouj
"Guy threatening me, what can I do?Hey, 18M here in Washington State. This is gonna be a long one.  
About a month and a half ago, I got into a fight with a guy when he hit his girlfriend (girl 1). No charges from that, so no worries there. However, his girlfriend is now dating that guy's friend, and I'm very close with the girl's sister (girl 2). I went with girl 2 to see her little brothers and girl 1's new boyfriend decided to talk to me. He heard a rumour that me and my friend beat up the first guy, and said if he found out there was a second person there, he'd beat me and wouldn't stop until I stopped breathing, because 2 on 1 isn't ""fair"". Yesterday, at girl 2's baby shower, we got into a discussion about whether or not the new iPhone was any good (he buys a lot of expensive things because he thinks it makes him better than people, and he thinks if it costs more it's always better) and when I pulled up the hardware specs, he got mad because I showed him that the cameras aren't that great, the ram is sad, etc. And started threatening to beat my ass.

I sent him a text after the baby shower telling him not to threaten me again unless he had the guts to follow through, because he hasn't so far. He replied with, and I quote, ""Next time i see you I'ma fuck you up stay in your lane broke bitch your a fucking retard and pedophile talk shit get smoke next time I see you I'm throwing hands an I won't give a fuck whos your around."" Now, I know that might be tough to understand because while English is his first language, he's not great at it. Basically he called me broke because I have a OnePlus instead of an iPhone, and threatened me again. This was followed by several more threats.  
Now, while I would love to see him follow through and give me an excuse to set him straight, knowing that he's very heavily focused on items and money, I was wondering if there's any legal action I can take against him. I feel like it would be much more satisfying to make him lose his precious stuff. Can I sue him? Or maybe even get him locked up?

Hello, so in June an acquaintance sent me a screenshot of a 4chan thread of photos that people masturbate to I guess(? I’m not very familiar with 4chan but that’s how my friend described the thread). On the thread, someone was posting fully-clothed selfies from my Instagram, that I posted when I was 14-16. 

My friend and I did some digging, and we got the kik of the poster. I posed as my ex and messaged him trying to find out who he was. I sent him one of my own lewds to further the idea that I wasn’t actually myself and he asked for more pics. I just deleted kik and forgot about it. 

Yesterday, the same username added me on snapchat, and messaged me my own lewd asking if it was me. He tried to lie and say someone random sent it to him, and I called him out and told him it was really me who kiked him. Then I essentially manipulated him into telling me who he was, by telling him I was SO flattered he found me attractive, lol. 

Turns out he’s someone I went to high school with who I never would have suspected of this.

"I was told to “remain neutral and not pick a side” while I was shuffled into a room for a photo op with the mayor.Hey y’all, so I live in Chicago and if you may know there is a teacher strike going on. Currently I attend university and Im doing my student teaching - think of it like an internship except for teachers. Because of the strike my uni told me I would need to attend a community organization in lieu of my regular placement since there are no students and I would be working with kids that weren’t in school. I was fine with this because I was still fulfilling the amount of hours needed to graduate. 

Well, I show up to the community organization and I saw a news truck but didn’t think much of it. Come to find out that the mayor would be dropping by in an hour to do a photo shoot with a bunch of the kids. Cameras start showing up and walking around the hallways then they shuffle us into a room where the mayor was going to come and read a story to the children. Meanwhile, I was texting my university supervisor asking what to do and she said I was to not “pick a side” but remain neutral. This bugged me because I felt that by putting me in a room where the mayor was going to take a photo op they were essentially using me as a token. I exited the room once the mayor got there because I didn’t agree with the whole thing. Either way I guess my question is did I have my first amendment rights violated? I don’t really want to pursue any legal action but I’m genuinely curious if by my publicly funded university planting me in a room with the mayor during a strike and telling me to remain neutral and not pick a side is a violation of the first amendment.

I dont feel particularly safe or comfortable here, knowing that their leasing agents, and maybe these strangers have our house code. It's a keypad lock, rather than a key. 
There was no mention of this before we got the 24 hour notice email, and I'm just worried what might happen if none of us are home when they decide to do a showing.

"Are retired drug dogs legal?So I am living in an apartment complex in Texas and I smoke weed, that's the basis of this story. So as you would expect when you smoke in an apartment you have to be very careful. Well for quite a while I wasn't as careful as I should be I suppose. I would smoke out on the porch and Ash on the sidewalk. So the penalty of this is, a neighbor who himself is a retired police officer, owns a retired drug dog. He walks this dog by often and one day the dog sits and won't move this being the signal for drugs. We thing the dog is just being stubborn but the neighbor says this and says someone must have dropped something there. He then says he's not gonna say anything that's he's cool and won't tell on us, admitting he knows it's me and my buddy. Well we feel some relief but still shook and not believing him totally. A week later we then get a letter from management saying a drug dog in the complex has sniffed an illicit substance coming from the patio. My question is, if a drug dog is retired, is it legal for the dog to still practice? Now I know if the dog is trained it's habit but is it legal for the owner to intentionally use this?

"Planning on Posting a Video Review of Terrible Rental Complex**Background:**

I recently moved from a luxury rental complex in South Florida. We had lived there for two years. About a year in, a new company bought the complex and began major renovations. It started with the community facilities and pools, and then they began renovating the apartments themselves. They immediately hiked up the rent $500 to anyone who wanted to renew. In our building of about 8 apartments, six tenants moved out within the span of three months. They began construction immediately and it was..loud. Like wall-shaking loud. 

The construction devastated my health and caused migraines and vertigo. I was sleep-deprived constantly. My husband worked night shift and needed to sleep during the day, we were in hell.

They frequently started earlier than 7AM and went later than 5PM. This included breaking titles which broke the legal sound barrier limit. Despite numerous complaints from us, they continued heavy construction. We finally negotiated a termination of our lease (which wasn't supposed to be up for another six months.) And scrambled to find another apartment which we finally did and moved out last week.

**Now for my question:** 

I have nearly 30 video clips (timestamped) as well as series of ridiculous emails between myself, their local management team and their corporate office that makes me them look like the villains they are. I want to make a review video and post about the realities of my experience with their management and construction--warning future tenants not to lease with these people.

  
Are there any legal repercussions to an honest review of this nature on a well-followed YouTube channel? As well as cross-posted on Yelp and other review sites? I'm currently with a private renter now and will most likely buy a house after this (will never rent or live in an apartment again if it can be helped.)

"Company sending invoice for much more than agreed sale price.Earlier this year, I made a purchase on a company's online store. The item was on sale for $169.99, normal price $439.99. I had been on the fence about making a purchase for this, and finally decided that with that sale price I could justify it. I made the purchase using their online store, and used PayPal for the payment. Purchased for the sale price. Got confirmation that the order processed, and about a week later I received the item I purchased in the mail. As far as I could tell, everything was fine.   


Fast forward to a full two months later. I receive an email from a representative of the company saying that the original payment failed from PayPal and that that I owe them the money for the item. They attach an invoice and are trying to get me to pay the $439.99 price. I would absolutely not have purchased the item for that amount. I then check my PayPal account and see that I had a pending payment for the company in the original sale amount that said it was waiting on the company to accept it.   


I've been back and forth with PayPal and this company a few times now and so far the basic summary of the situation is that, PayPal says they never received any requests to pay the larger $439.99 amount they only ever got one for the sale price amount. The company is refusing to acknowledge that the item was on sale, or any possible fault on their end for not accepting the original payment or invoicing me for the much higher price. The real kicker here is that the exact same item I purchased from them is *still* on sale on their online store to this very day for the sale price.   


To be absolutely transparent, they currently *have not been paid* anything because they declined to accept the original payment I authorized. I am not looking to get away without paying, I would gladly pay them the sale price that I agreed to when I purchased, but I'm not pleased to be effectively extorted for 2.5 times the price I agreed to so I have not given in to their requests that I pay them that higher amount.  


So I guess the reason I'm here is to ask... what options to I have for combating them on this? How much to I really need to worry about them pressuring making a payment I never agreed to. Is there a specific area of law that I should look into for this issue? Any particular kinds of representation I would have to seek? I realize that in the grand scheme of things roughly $300 is not of money to be fighting over given legal fees and the time involved in combating them but I'm just so irked on principle alone about this whole mess.

"Roommate’s Leftover Stuff/Identity Theft (?)Hi Reddit. I have two problems with my roommate I could use help figuring out. I live in Washington state. 

Problem 1:
My apartment lease is ending next month. I have gotten all of my belongings out of the apartment, but my roommate still has a lot of random things left there. He told me three different dates of when he was going to pick it up so we could hire a cleaner, but the stuff is still there. I tried contacting him multiple times recently to see when he’ll have it out, but he is ignoring my texts and leaving me on read. I talked to the apartment today and they said to over communicate with him saying if he doesn’t have his stuff out by X date, then I’ll throw everything out so the apartment can be cleaned. The issues I have with this are that I don’t know if he’ll legally come after me later because I got rid of his stuff, and I’m not physically capable of moving the rest out and would have to pay someone to take it away. The apartment also said that we would both be held legally responsible for any leftover items/ the condition of the apartment. I’m also afraid I’ll have to clean it all by myself when he left a huge mess in his room and bathroom or I’ll have to hire someone and pay for it all myself. 

I feel my options are to either pay someone to take his junk and hire cleaners (or clean by myself), or leave everything and have the apartment charge us both so at least I’m not paying everything out of my own pocket. Even with this option, I’m afraid if I pay my half, he won’t pay his and the apartment could go after us both. I also don’t know how much they’d charge us. 

Problem 2:
I found out that the same roommate stole my SSN (I’m assuming from our lease when we applied for the apartment) and opened a utility account in my name. I have since shut it down, but am worried of what else he’ll do with that information and don’t know what to do going forward.",legaladvice,t3_dkst1l

"Can I sue landlord for (a portion of paid rent)/ lower rent for repairs not fixed since moving in? :: IndianaWe moved in during June. 

Outlets in our two bathrooms haven’t worked since moving in. 

The installed microwave hasn’t worked since moving in.

One month (so far) without access to our Master shower, because when used it leaks on our downstairs neighbors. 

Window blinds in a bedroom were just installed yesterday October 20th (lease states that only the Landlord can install blinds) 

There was mold from a dishwasher leak and cabinets had to be removed. Landlord paid for us to stay in a hotel for 3 days, but did not give a per diem for food. 

When we got back to our condo, our kitchen sink was laying in our living room. So for the next three days we opted to drive to a friends everyday, and return home at night, instead of staying in a cheap hotel again. (Should we be compensated for mileage?) 

Today we used our dishwasher and checked for leaks under the sink... we saw [this. ](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/H7B9RSu) 

Apparently the mold removers had to cut the garbage disposal cord to remove the cabinets. This is how whoever our landlord hired decided to repair this. (We have a toddler)

"[California] Can third parties be held responsible for maintaining/enforcing the distance stipulation of a restraining order?Hi all. I represent a non-profit organization that is currently planning its annual conference. One registrant (Attendee A) noted that they have filed a restraining order against another potential attendee (Attendee B), who cannot be in the same physical space as Attendee A. Attendee A has not mentioned the exact stipulations of the restraining order.

&amp;nbsp;

This has spawned a large legal question for the organization. Staff will do our best to maintain distance between the two throughout event programming. However, if staff were unable to prevent the two from inadvertently coming within the distance stipulated in the restraining order, could our organization be held liable, as event organizers, for not doing enough to meet the requirements of the R.O. if Attendee A were to sue?

Security Deposit and Late FeesI rented an apartment in uptown New Orleans only to find out the day I moved in that her and her husband are notorious slumlords. Her assistant even told me at move in that she would not give me my security deposit back because she never gives anyone them so to be prepared for that. However through out the year of my tenant seem I had problem after problem after problem but I did not break my lease I paid my rent every month and I'm stayed there the whole year. I gave her written 60 day notice to vacate which was required. I had no balance due at the time of move out and there were no damages to the unit. I cleaned the unit and turned my keys in before the last day of the month. So basically everything that I was supposed to do. I send her my forwarding address and asked her to mail me my deposit and she tells me that she will get it there and ask for my address. The 30 days goes by and I have not received my deposit check so I reach out to her on the 1st and let her know that I have not received it. She gave me some story about September checks getting lost in the mail and that she would reissue it to me. So I received the deposit and the glider of deductions after the 30 days if she was required to get it to me and I had to contact her several more times to get her to send it to me by the middle of that following month. When I got in I was being charged $100 late fee for the last six months in a road that I was there. However she never once notified me to let me know that my rent was late because it wasn't and it was also dropped off in the drop box at the office and she lives in New Jersey so her assistant picks it up. I have text from the assistant sometimes saying that she's picked up rent but hasn't deposit it and has been holding on to it. So my question is can she charge me late fees for 6 months in a row without ever notifying me to let me know that my rent was late? She lives in New Jersey and we drop the checks in the Box in New Orleans that are assistant picks up and has admitted several times on text that she's gotten the check she just hadn't made it to the bank to cash them. So does she have to notify me if my rent is late or can she just say I was late without ever notifying me throughout the last six months of my lease and take it out of my security deposit?

1. She had told my father multiple times that she wants 'beat me up' and fight me, especially because I was gay, and the only thing holding her back is her going to jail. I have at least one instance of this on recording.
2. She has made me the pivot point for her defense. She's effectively claiming that I'm manipulating my dad so I get all of his things. I have proof that she was the one manipulating him originally. My father's first will had about 90% of all he owned going to this ex.
3. She's also decided that she wanted to practice this story with other members of my family, calling at least one family member with this story, lying about both me and my father to try to get her hostile to my family. 
4. She has been trying to use my sister as a way to find my dad's location, whereabouts and such. She is expecting that my father should be dying soon as he was diagnosed with 3-6 months to live in April. However he's recently been told that he may live up to 5 more years

I desire to rid myself of a tenant.  I own the house, I'm renting a single bedroom to a young man who also works for my employer.

I handed him a lease agreement based on a various lease agreements found online.  It mentions a 30-day notice period for termination, but I think that should actually be 60 days in the state of Georgia.  There is a clause stating that no language in the lease shall supersede any law should the language of the lease be found to conflict with the law.  Any such section shall be amended to comply with the law.  Notably (and regrettably) absent from this lease agreement: Criminal Activity clauses, Smoking clauses.  While I did discuss the matter of smoking with him (I would have none of it indoors), I didn't see it necessary to discuss anything about illegal drugs (I've got nothing against people smoking weed, but I would prefer not to open my property to the risk of forfeiture).

Also absent from this lease agreement: either of our signatures.  He never reviewed it, nor did he sign it, nor did he hand it to me for further review or co-signing.  I presumed that he intended to go over this with me after getting settled in (stupid of me, I know).  He has, however, promptly paid for each of the two months he has resided here, but he's shorting me $50 each month per what I originally wrote on the lease which I handed him.

I believe that, legally, he is a ""tenant-at-will,"" and I very much no longer will to retain his occupancy.  I wish to terminate his occupancy for the following reasons:  Smoking indoors, bringing illegal drugs onto the property.

"Sublessee Filed Chargeback on Rent Payments Using My Leasing Account, Debt Collectors After MeHello all.

About a year ago I had to move out of my apartment on short notice. I scrambled to find someone who I could sublease to. Fortunately, it didn't take me long to find someone who was willing to take up my offer. I found this guy on Facebook - he was a current student at the same university I was going to, and he seemed like a nice guy. My impression of him only improved after meeting him and his family in person. After showing him the apartment he agreed to move in. 

Per the terms of my lease, subleasing was allowed only with written consent from the landlord. I talked with management (landlord) and they consented verbally, saying they didn't care as long as rent was being paid. I knew many other students who lived in the complex were doing the same, and in desperation to cover my rent and my ignorance as a first-time renter, I went ahead and had him move in without drafting any paperwork. No contract between he and I and no written consent from management, nothing. 

Anyhow, my sublessee was a good tenant and there were no major problems with his stay. He always paid rent in full and on time, and he seemed to be enjoying himself when I came to visit my other former roommates. I thought my crisis was averted; that is, until debt collectors started calling me a few months ago on behalf of management. They claimed that I owed them upwards of $2,500 (rent + interest). It was not a scam call. 

Thankfully, I didn't agree to pay anything, but I was baffled. I visited the office the next day to figure out why they sent debt collectors after me.

Apparently, my sublessee filed chargebacks on two rent payments. I had no idea why he'd do this, how he was able to get those approved, or how it was even possible for him to file chargebacks on payments *I made with my account* in the first place. Then I realized what had happened. 

The first few months, I had him send me the rent money and I'd use my account to make the payment. But 3 months in, he asked for my account information (not bank, but leasing portal) so he could make the payments on his own. For what, I didn't know, but I trusted him and gave him my username and password. Second mistake... 

Management was wholly sympathetic to my cause, as it seemed like he was scheming from their point of view, but they said their hands were tied. 

I called him multiple times but he never picked up. I sent him a text explaining the situation in the most non-accusatory way possible and asked him if we could talk soon. Still no response. 

My sublessee was a likeable guy, but having spent a good deal of time around him I could totally see him doing this just to keep some extra money in his pocket. He's a cheapskate in the worst way possible, like Mr. Krabs level cheap. I wouldn't think much his penny-pinching ways if that was what he needed to do to get by, but ~~he~~ his family is very wealthy. What's more, his lifestyle choices - the Benz he drives, the parties he goes to, the rent he pays - are funded entirely by his parents. 

So yeah, *maybe* he had a good reason for filing those chargebacks, but I highly doubt it. All I know is I'm on the hook for this.

I've learned many important lessons in having to deal with this situation, but I can't help but feel like a total idiot. Never in my life have I been finessed this hard. In any case, I need advice, which is why I came to this sub: 

1) Why have the debt collectors stopped calling me? I'm still on the hook for this, no? 

2) Can I fight this? Does what my sublessee did - using my account credentials to make payments to file chargebacks to get the money back - is this fraud? Identity theft? 

3) I'm just barely recovering from homelessness, I can't afford to pay this. What can I do if I'm forced to pay up?",legaladvice,t3_dkup3q

"Partial signature and date not written by me (NJ)My doctor said he would run a test in his office and the office confirmed it would be billed as an office visit. When I came in for the test, I was given a consent form for test and billing as they were hooking up me for the test. I put down the first two letters of my name before I realized they were going to bill it as an outpatient hospital service so I stopped signing because my insurance doesn't cover hospital. The nurse said to sign quickly because the doctor was waiting and I was being hooked up. I refused to sign so she took the form from me and said we would solve this after the test. After the test, I asked about the form and the nurse said I didn't need to sign anything, it would be billed as an office visit. She then said, ""you're good. You can go."" 

Now, I received a bill for a huge amount because it is being billed as a hospital visit. The bill even has the address of some hospital, not the doctor's office. The office is telling me they never promised they would bill it as an office visit and that their office is considered part of this hospital.

"A company gave my business data to a client without consent. Can I sue?I run a marketing consulting agency based in Texas that purchases ad inventory from another ad agency based in the US. I then resell this inventory to my consulting clients based in Sweden.

One of my clients contacted the ad agency that my consultancy uses (they figured out who I used) and requested data from my business account relating to their website. The ad agency gave them impression data and the financial costs that my company incurred for those impressions. This was done without my consent.

I previously wrote to them by email that nobody should be able to access my account except myself and my company. I was told no one would be able to access my account except myself under any circumstance. Also from their privacy and data policy on their website this is made clear as well that data will never be given to third-parties. My client is not a part of my company and the account is under my own company name. However my clients website name is listed in my clients section of my account. Secondly, I had requested over 2 weeks ago, before the data was sent to my customer, that my account be deleted and this was never done, however by email they confirmed it would be done. The reason for deletion is because I was moving to another agency.

After my client received the data including the costs I incurred (I mark up the prices) they decided to terminate their relationship with my company and purchase direct from the ad agency. This was a client for over 5 years, my largest client, and has ruined my company.

Am I able to sue the ad agency and reach a financial settlement of some kind? I'm not sure if there is a type of lawyer who takes these kind of cases on a pro bono basis and keeps a percent of the settlement.

Their actions have ruined my business financially and I'm not sure what will happen with me personally because of this. My company will be forced to close. Further, is what they have done illegal? Perhaps against US or GDPR data laws? I am a US company and they sent the data to Europe.

"Phone company charged $4 dollars monthly for 15 years for a service that was never applied to my account. (PA/USA)I have had a home phone account with this company since 1995. I was curious about a $4 monthly service charge on my statements so I called to have it explained. 

Upon calling, I was told it was to keep my number out of the directory. I never requested this service so I tried to figure out how long it's been on my bill. The supervisor I spoke to said they couldn't find a service request for when it started and while checking, they found out that the service has never been applied to my account and my number has always been listed in the directory. 

That means I've been paying for a service I wasn't even receiving. It appears to be on my bill since I opened the account which would be 15 years ago, give or take a couple of months. Added up, that's about $1100.  

The rep only had access to my past billing until July 2018, where the charge still appears up until this month so they offered me a $60 credit for 15 months of the service. I told them if they could email me copies of the first bill it appears on and the one before that (without the charge) then I would consider their offer. I did not receive an email or the proof I requested but instead had a $60 credit added to my account for the next month.

My father (51M) is completely disabled, physically as in he cant walk properly most of the time, cant sit for too long and cant stand for too long. He also has a variety of mental health issues, such as SEVERE anxiety and depression (he's attempted suicide twice) and he cant even go into a grocery store that he's not used to without a panic attack. He's been fighting for SSI since 2011, he has been rejected several times, and lived with me for about two years until financially I could no longer care for him. He also has COPD and has been hospitalized a few times for this and pneumonia along with MRSA a couple times. The MRSA has cleared up btw. 

Moving on, he has been approved for SSI as of last year. They granted him a small back pay portion of $2500 USD, and $408 per month. He was supposed to get further back pay of about $19,000 give or take. The state, (Oregon) is taking $6,000 for back child support for my older sister (aged 33) and the rest is going to restitution for the state based on an assault charge that my dad had in 2005 or so (if it matters, the next door neighbor was creepy and my dad confronted him and then he tried to fight my dad. Neighbor got the worst of it so they arrested my dad). They have also decided that they will be taking the $408 per month that my dad gets for SSI. This is his only source of income.

"What should I discuss during consultationJust wanting to start getting realistic when I see a divorce attorney for consultation. I currently live in Louisiana with my husband but plan to move back to Alabama. I plan on divorcing my husband of 5 years (together for 8) within 6 months due to multiple times he has cheated (proof of all times cheated with me). No kids but we are doing a debt consolidation and in the middle of paying all that off and my car that is in both of our names but is a “gift” to me several years ago that is paid off. 
He has always made great money as a welder working outside of the state while I was at home working jobs making just above minimum wage due to helping my parents with my disabled brother. So I have almost always relied on his help for essentials. 
He has cheated on me twice this year (if you don’t count the dating profile he made two years ago that I found with the other stuff from the beginning of the year). First towards the beginning of the year and the second time three days before our fifth year anniversary. I have all of the proof in a separate email that he doesn’t know about. 
He has opened credit cards in my name without me knowing and maxxed it out. Then wouldn’t pay it. But I don’t have proof that he was the one who did it because he applied for them online. That’s what the debt consolidation was for. 
I’m about to take a job that makes twice what I used to so that should help me out. I have a separate bank account from way before we met each other that he has never even deposited in, let alone made joint. But I want to make sure that I have my other ducks in a row before I get a uhaul and get my stuff. 
I will be “lawyer shopping” later this month and want to use my “free consultation” wisely. I know I have one time to talk to them and after that it costs money.

"Is S-Corp the best way to conduct business in US as a foreigner?Currently a F-1 Student here, someone I am close with that is a US citizen wants me to join him on starting a very small but good opportunity clothing business here in California. I am a Canadian citizen. A specific foreigner case I am unsure about legally.

What is the best way to legally start a partnership of some sort, (even going in as employee is fine) just wanting to abide by law and the most cost efficient way to start the business. F-1 students can only work part time on campus (rare exceptions), I am willing to go through any process as I would like to take this opportunity if I can. I do not care to have equity and honestly fine with being an employee if theres a legal way to conduct business that way. I will mostly be operating the business through internet and not a brick and mortar store. My US citizen friend would likely be the face of the company.

We were recently suggested starting a corporation (s corp) and was looking what type of partnership would be best from people with experience in similar circumstances. Leaving the country and coming back to sort visa issues is not much of a problem, a working visa would be nice.

"Does landlord have the right to evict for using garage outlet to charge EV?For starters, my girlfriend and I both live in southern California, you can start to see here how ubiquitous EVs are starting to become but some areas still have little to no access to public areas. One of our deal breakers when we went apartment hunting was the inability to charge her  car. We read the entire terms of agreement on our lease and know it makes no explicit statement about use of the private garage outlets. We even asked our landlord if it was OK to use it for EV charging and was verbally given the go ahead so we of course signed in. A year passes and our lease is due for renewal, they do their required inspection of the apartment and garage to which they find everything within agreement until they noticed the little basic 120v slow charger plugged in. We were shocked to hear from the report that the charger should be removed and that we are due to another reinsepection. She relies on that station to arrive to and from work everyday since there aren't any reasonably placed public charger near us to take advantage from. Are they within and should we find a new place?

**TLDR**:GF needs feasible access to EV charging, nothing in lease says we can't use garage outlets, landlords gives the go-ahead, we sign lease. Lease is due for renewal but inspector requests removal of 120v slow car charger.",legaladvice,t3_dkr0ks

"Boss wants to deduct money shortage from my pay in FloridaOkay, so I'm a shift lead at a pizza shop in the state of Florida. Last night, I was closing manager,  and while counting out money  and closing the system I came out with cash over what the system said we should have had. I counted it thrice. 

Okay, so I just took part of it and threw that in the bank bag we use for instore tips, that we divide amongst the managers and instore employees every week. The other part I just left in the deposit so it said we were about 40 bucks over. 

This morning my boss sends me a pic of the printed daily operating report. Under the cash over for the day part, it says ""Team member shortage $148"" and then below that, it says ""Total Cash Short $106"" 

Now, maybe this was a fuck up where a driver's money owed to the store wasn't saved when they clocked out, I don't know, honestly, I clocked out the majority of the drivers, and I saved payments, what they owed the store at the end of their shift, like we have to do, but the opening manager may have clocked out a driver as well and took their money owed. We also had another instore employee, whose been training to be a shift lead, and all 3 of us all well as some of the drivers used the till to cash out carryout orders. So pretty much every Tom, Dick, and Harry had access to all of the money, and could have screwed up somewhere when cashing out orders. 


I'm sorry if this is kind of jumbled, I'm hella confused myself and I apologize for not making this coherent from the get go. 

This store already doesn't have the best money practices. The safe is not used at all. We only have one working till/cash register, and all of the store cash is kept in that drawer. At the end of the night the deposit is just put into a bank bag and into a cabinet in the office that has a lock on it, but the lock is very rarely, if ever, used. 

When I was counting the deposit out and counting store cash and driver banks (the money delivery drivers start their shift with), I did not see the team member shortage or the total cash short numbers. 

I only saw the cash over bit, because that's the part I have to copy down in the book we use every day to record that, total net sales, labor cost, food cost, plus out the door times, and customer service compliance numbers. 

I just woke up to the texts my GM sent and a voicemail with her saying ""I didn't work yesterday, I'm not paying for this, this is on you, opening manager, and instore employee."" 

So my question is, will it be legal for my employer to dock our pay for this amount we are apparently short by? I've googled this question, and I think for FL it says as long as it doesn't knock the employee down to below minimum wage, they can, whether we sign an agreement for it or not. Is this true? 


I'm also really confused as to how one number is saying we were over, but this other number is saying it's short.

"I was assaulted(I think) last week and the police want to speak to me.I'm 15 and live in Ireland and the main thing I want to know is if I'm allowed to speak to the police alone without my parents or if I'm allowed to avoid talking to them and just write down what happened. It happened during school lunch and I'm allowed downtown for lunch.

 A boy had wanted to fight me and I was very reluctant to fight from the start and everyone knew this. A lot of people had heard there was going to be a fight and I was scared there would as I'm in transition year which is only in Ireland I think and it cost nearly €1000 for the whole thing and my parents would kill me if I got kicked out over a fight so other than simply having no motifs or dislike for the boy I didn't want to do it. A lot of people who wanted the fight said they'd drag me over to him if I didn't go to the boy so I reluctantly did and it became clear he didn't want to fight because of the amount of people around who probably would've rathered I won not because I'm overly popular but because he's hated because he's always fighting. I got to where he was and I stood there while he was talking shit and was saying ""come at me"" I'm which I didn't but put my fists up thinking he'd eventually back out under pressure in which he didn't. 

We walked around in a circle and had no intention of fighting unless I was absolutely forced to as walking away was never an option. We had basically walked a small circle and my best friend came in trying to defuse the situation and I thought it would work and told me not to do anything. My hands dropped down by my side and I was listening to him try to tell me to walk away which wouldn't work but it calmed me and next thing the lad punches me in the face completely unexpected(I drift away and typically struggle to concentrate and having a fight seemed unlikely so I wasn't expecting anything) and he lunges at me grabbing me and he's trying to pull me while I grabbed him and I fell/he pushed me and I smashed my head head off a wall and he punched me in the eye. My friend called an ambulance and the police came too. I later got 5 stitches.

$400 red light ticket.So this is a bit of a story and I really have no idea what to do. When I was backpacking in late August I ended up selling my car to a used dealership. When we test drove it he ended up running a red light. One of the guys I was living with at the time send me a message a couple days ago telling me about the ticket(he got it because I put the Qld rental address I was at as I did not have an a perming address at the time). I am now back in Canada and have been since early September. I have no way of paying this ticket since my Aussie bank account are is closed and I can’t afford it since I am back in school studying again.$400 is really expensive for a student. I know it was the dealer driving as the route he took was distinct and I only drove to the dealership that day to sell the car. Problem is I have no idea which dealership it was as I can not find the paperwork. If I could find it I could most likely send the gov an email telling them who was driving but that’s not an option atm and they would need to take my word for it. I don’t think that’s likely.

"Car towed due to employers mistake, what now?Hi everyone, I’m having one hell of a time trying to figure out my next steps.

Background: 

I work for a small local coffee/tea shop in Arizona that does not have much parking around our building. When I was hired about a month ago (and all other employees were told this) I was told to park about 2 blocks away in a shopping centers parking lot. The owner of the entire company, all of my coworkers, and myself all park there for every shift. Some of the girls I work with have received flack from the property manager for parking there because there is a high school adjacent to the parking area, and he thought they were high schoolers parking there. Other than that, there hasn’t been any issues. The owner of the company had even said that if we ever run into any issues with the property manager, to call her directly and that she would sort it out herself. 

Thursday I went in for my shift at 7:30am and parked in my usual spot. I got off at 1pm and my car was gone. I immediately knew it had been towed. I called my manager and explained the situation and sent her a photo of where I had parked, and also contacted the towing company. I get a call back from my boss saying that the area we had all been parking in was not correct, and that everyone had been “assuming the risk” by parking there. Management said that it would be MY responsibility to pay for the tow, even though every other employee that works there (including the owner) parks there. The cost is $117 and I know they can afford to pay it, but are choosing not to. My coworkers are all on my side and are very upset for me. I make minimum wage and I’m only scheduled 1 day a week, there’s no way in hell I can pay for this, and that was even mentioned to management by a seasoned employee. 

I emailed management yesterday asking about reconciliation and how I could be reimbursed for this since my car is STILL impounded. No response. I even offered to have the amount garnished over a few paychecks.

My question is, how do I proceed? Do I get an attorney involved? Do I go to the police? Quite frankly, I’m at a complete loss on what to do next. I can not afford this at all, cannot take out a loan, and do not have anyone I know that would help me out. I’m considering quitting at this point because I feel like I’m being made into an example and that my employer is trying to wipe their hands of the situation. However, I don’t have another source of income at the moment. I absolutely hate confrontation and this whole situation has been a nightmare for me.

I sent them a detailed message regarding it and said i'll be using the deposit to pay for the damages and they'll get the remainder if there is any. They replied and claimed that it might be my neighbors that hit my garage door since they use my driveway to back out. They also said that they'll take me to court if I use their deposit for repairs. I'm not sure what to do as I've never been in this situation before. 

*I have pictures of my property from before move in date and def shows no damage

*I have a text from him admitting to scratches inside the garage but not hitting the garage door itself

*My lease prior to move in date has all prior damage listed, just nothing about the garage (didnt think this would happen)

"PA - Next door neighbor's tree fell down on another neighbors shed, do I have any liability?We and our next door neighbors share a privacy fence along the rear of our properties. About 1-2 feet inside their property line, there was an old tall Douglass Fir that was dead and rotting for awhile. They recently had a tree company in to repair another tree on their property, but the company told them the fir was ""stable"". Turns out that wasn't quite true.

Last week we had crazy high winds. The tree fell down on the privacy fence, and on to another neighbor's shed.

That shed owning neighbor paid my wife and I a visit yesterday to see if we knew whose tree it was. We have a surveyor's map from 2007 showing the tree is on our next door neighbor's property, but just barely. The map was from when the previous homeowners were having a carport added to what is now our home. So we showed them the map we had. They asked for a copy and told us that their insurance company would still be contacting us and the neighbors on Monday since the agent wasn't sure where the property boundary was.

We are going to run off copies of the map on monday to provide them.

My only concern here - are we potentially responsible for any branches that hung over the property line on to our property? I've attached part of the map to show what I mean. There really weren't any branches left but I am just trying to understand if there is any way this could be twisted into putting some liability on us.

My big concern is that there's a good chance that the next door neighbor's insurance wont cover it if the tree was rotting, so I could see this becoming a nasty issue very quickly and people grabbing for straws to find money.

Here is the section of the surveyor's map in question.

"Permanent Alimony vs. Bridge-the GapMarried 30 years as of tomorrow we live in Florida. Stay-at-home mom for last thirteen years so husband could work longer hours while I homeschooled for three years or had our kid in a private school for the rest. I had to drive to and from school, plus after school activities. I drove our kid from 3 pm to usually 6 to 8pm depending if it was games, practices, or youth group. I also typed up STBXH work contracts.   


I know I qualify for permanent alimony. My question is: Can I ask for temporarily more support under bridge the gap (2 years) vs. longer term, less alimony. I'm talking an extra 600 to 700 a month. I'd rather have enough shorter term so I can have time to update my skills and get a job like I had before I quit working than a crappier job right away because a smaller amount wouldn't cut it.   


Any advice or knowledge you can share would be appreciated.",legaladvice,t3_dksqli
"Help with debt collector (NV)I moved out of an apartment, they immediately turned over a final balance to collections. Half of what they say I owe, I don't. Some of it is from utilities that weren't posted when I made my last payment through their portal. The rest is for a cleaning fee which I paid up front when I moved in, an additional cleaning fee, carpet cleaning and shampooing. I've sent the debt collector a letter to validate the debt and they sent back a list of the items. They also are charging me interest which I understand is illegal since the original contract, my lease, makes no mention of charging interest. I'm stuck as to what my next steps are to dispute the debt, I've already filed a  CFPB complaint about the interest, but I'm not sure what's next. I'd be ok paying the half, the utilities they didn't post to my online account, but that's it, I'm also concerned about my credit since the apartment office never contacted me and turned it immediately to collections.

"Colorado landlord heat shenanigansSo our landlord has been having trouble with our heating. First off it didn't work at all. but then they figured that the heater needed water in it. So now our heat works, but only if we bypass the thermostat. So it's either totally on, or totally off. Kind of a pain in the ass since there's a dog at home and the electricity bill would go through the roof leaving on the heat while i work. 

I assume this means that it's not in good working order and I keep getting the workaround and bandaide solutions that have been going on for over a month. I hear that I can get a court order for the landlord to fix this heating issue. However I'm not sure how to do this. Also I've read that I can withhold rent until this issue is resolved, but I'm very reluctant to do so. I believe that this could lead to other issues.

"Own a home and let my freeloading friend stay with me until they get back on their feet. Refused to pay rent for almost a year and has been an overall nuisance, how do I go about evicting?I live in Pennsylvania and my friend was in a bad situation and needed to get back on their feet. I own a home and have a spare room so I offered for them to stay with me until they get back in their feet. We had agreed on 200$ a month but didn't put it in writing (I know it was stupid, hindsight is 20/20). Right before moving in, they quit their job. The first couple months they said they couldn't pay so we told them to do what they could for the time being. Apparently that was nothing, in fact, we (my husband and I) had to even pay for their groceries. I did this because we had an almost 10 year friendship and they were coming out of a bad situation. 

I ended up helping them get a job where I work and rent still never came for 11 months. There was a constant back and forth about just paying something because we needed to cover the increase in utilities. Nothing came of it. During this time, they were rude to my husband and I, would not do their dishes, would not take out their trash, and treated my home like a hotel with a maid service. I was expected to wake them up when they were late, and take their trash out because ""it's all going to the same place anyway."" I realize I should have evicted them then but I didn't want them out on their asses in the middle of winter. 

They finally started paying rent last January. It wasn't the full amount but it was something. Fast forward to last July, we told them we need them to move out in the near future because we would be starting to move on with our lives and wanted to start a family. They said they would need until the end of August to get some money together and look at places. We agreed.

 They quit their job in the beginning of August and said they needed until the end of September because they would be starting a new job. They got the job and are now FINALLY paying full rent. However mid September came and went and they said they were going to be out by mid October. It's now mid October. Last week, my husband asked which day they were planning on moving multiple times. They ignoring him until Thursday when they said they weren't planning on leaving. We tried to set a date for this weekend and made clear we want this to end amicably. They said they're not going anywhere, ""know their rights"", and closed the door in my husband's face.

"Stuck in Lease ExtensionSo I’m a tenant in NYC who just purchased a new place with my wife. The process was arduous and took 6 weeks longer than our original lease. I discussed options with my landlord, and he said we needed to sign for an additional year but gave us a rider that would allow us to terminate one month late. At the time, we had cleared our interview with the co-op and expected to close one week into the new month. What we didn’t anticipate was the seller holding off until the very last day our offer was good for before closing. The one month extension we were given is now essentially worthless, but I recognize the situation.

The landlord will not give any additional months saying it is more difficult to rent after October and the only way out of the lease is if someone else begins renting. I get his view and it seems fair. We have made ample efforts to ensure the apartment is presentable and needs almost no work done to transition over.

Last year when we got into this apartment, the broker claimed that the landlord would work with us if we were planning to buy and arrange month to month, but don’t expect to see it in the lease contract (yeah... I feel stupid for missing the red flag). When I looked online, I only saw the apartment listed on one property app and nowhere else. Last month I also checked and saw it on multiple locations, meaning some were deliberately taken down. We feel the broker isn’t making enough effort to bring new people in and want to help, but we aren’t allowed to list anywhere.

It wouldn’t make sense for the broker to not help since he isn’t making money off of sitting on it, but he is very close with this landlord, and something feels off. We have done everything we can to make a seamless transition, but the landlord doesn’t mind since he is getting paid regardless.

"Want to take custody of my nephew. Need help/advice!I made a throwaway because I don't want anyone I know IRL to potentially see this.

I live in PA with my fiance, my mom lives in Ohio. She has raised my nephew since he was a baby. He's more like a little brother to me than my nephew. The problem is, the man she's married to (my step dad) is a toxic, abusive, oppressive POS, and he shares custody with my mom. They've been married for over 15 years.

I've been trying for years to facilitate a divorce between them, but the nature of abusive relationships and abusers makes that very difficult. It includes holding my nephew over my mom's head, and the threat that she can't leave without losing him. He doesn't deserve that. My stepdad has literally never said ""I love you"" to this kid, but wants to use him as a bargaining chip to force my mom to stay. Or for a tax break.

I want to get him out of there so he can salvage at least somewhat of a healthy childhood. My stepdad curses him out on a daily basis, constantly compares him to the father he's never known (my brother, and he is not like him), and has now convinced him he is bipolar and mentally ill. Trust me when I say this is classic projection. My stepdad is tragically the only father he's had.

He's 14. I've looked it up and his preference will be considered in a legal setting, but won't make the final decision. My mom is willing to consent to granting me custody, but think it will be a fight with my step-dad. 

Is there anyone who might be able to point me in the right direction?

I've never done something like this before, and don't even know where to start. Is it going to be a pricy, lengthy process? Will I need to do anything in particular to ""prove"" I will be a responsible guardian? Is there actually anything my stepdad could do to deny me custody, even though he's abusive? 

One more concern I have: I didn't have a great childhood either. And I almost got lost in the foster system when my own dad tried to force taking custody. I don't want that to happen to my nephew. I want to do this the right way.

I love that kid to death, I'm willing to do whatever it takes....I just need to know what it will take, and where to start.

Tell our real estate agent about what happened so she doesn't recommend him to others?

Post negative reviews about him online?  I don't know that I want to publically state my wife had an affair yet.  Can I just say something like: ""He lacks integrity.  Avoid.

"Can I do anything about being disinherited?It is a long story on unequal distribution. My Dad is a self-made man who became a CEO of a major Fortune 500 company. He is now in his 90s. I was raised in wealth but always treated differently, and even as a child there were many times he told me he didn't like me. I felt like an unwanted foster child.

I decided to take some time off from college when he cut me off. Five years later struggling to pay bills and put myself through college I contacted the family. My mother had died and my Dad remarried a much younger woman and they had 2 children. He agreed to help me with living expenses but not my tuition. I was grateful and it helped a lot. Fast forward to the time when I wanted to go the graduate school: he would not help. Nevertheless, over the years, he has helped me out from time to time and helped me buy a car.

I am on disability now and recently ran into some financial trouble when the owner of my apartment building sold the building and we all have to move. Rents are skyrocketing in my area. I approached my Dad and he said he would not help. He also said ""I am not a rich man.""

I turned to the internet and found out recently more about his assets. He owns 2 homes paid in full, one worth $1.6 million and last year sold a vacation condo for 3 million cash. Two weeks after the sale of the condo one of my step sisters who has no visible resources bought as 700,000k home. He has at least 1 mil in a stock portfolio and in retirement gets over 100k a year. His total net worth is well above 6 million.

My Dad made it clear to me upon his death everything will go to his second wife who I haven't spoken with in 10 years. The sale of the condo and the extra house shows up as an assset for my other step sister. He also fully funded their private school college tuitions including master's degrees at colleges where the tuition is $50,000.00 a year.

It hurts. I know I was always disliked, and least favoured. But I always thought he would provide some token amount for me. He is aware of my situation and that it is desperate. He just doesn't care. When I tried to talk to him about the whole situation, he became verbally abusive.

I guess life just isn't fair sometimes. My Dad's assets are all POD (payable on death) to his spouse. Is there anything I can do?

"[NC USA] Will accepting a position at another company impact my EEOC case?I opened an EEOC inquiry against my employer regarding a failure to accommodate a disability.  The claim I have submitted is that the accommodation has been unreasonably denied through inaction.  The employer is a large company with over 1000 employees, so there are dedicated HR avenues.

History (intentionally vague to not identify employer):

I have worked at company since May 2017.  I was diagnosed with a mental disorder in Sept 2018, and began treatment.  This diagnosis did not severely affect my job at the time treatment did improve my work.  I quickly got noticed, and was selected for a test run of a new position in Feb 2019, with the understanding that if the CBA of the position didn’t work out, I’d go back to my old position.  I was provided with a “loaner” laptop from our IT department and a work table (roughly 2.5’x4’) on the production floor.

By March 2019, I realized my diagnosis had the potential to impact the new position, though it had not done so yet.  I decided to disclose my diagnosis to HR, so that it was on record should it ever become a problem.

The CBA was well worth it, and I was chosen to fulfill the position full-time in April 2019.  My duties started to shift as we refined what needed to be done and defined the process.  As the process got streamlined, additional duties got added on.  The position started as 85/15 split between physical activity/administrative work. It slowly progressed, and is now roughly 50/50 between the two.

The physical work is easy to do, and needs no refinement or accommodation.  However, the administrative work requires additional time and mental labor, as I am now evaluating data and refining processes outside of my personal area in order to fulfill the position duty of “prevent unnecessary loss”.

With my mental disorder, organization is extremely important for stress management and combating executive dysfunction.  The work table and loner I was assigned quickly proved to be insufficient for me.  I disclosed my disorder to my boss in June 2019, and requested that my work table be moved off of the production floor.  This request was well within reason for the size of my employer, and would not impact my assigned duties job in a negative sense or impose undue burden.

I continued to follow up with my boss in our 1-on-1 bi-weekly meetings (as I was not in the communication loop), and was constantly told that he was “working on it”.  I received an upgraded laptop (mainly software updates were needed for my administrative work), from a separate request, and was dated temporarily by that as I implemented a few organization techniques that were not able to be done on the old laptop.

In August 2019, I grew impatient.  I followed up, once more, on the desk and reminded my boss that it was an ADA request, and asked if he had spoken with HR, as they may have access to resources he did not.  He informed me at this time he was unaware it was ADA related (despite my specifically explaining my disorder, diagnosis, and that the accommodation would be for that).  He instructed me to go to HR to fulfill proper channels.

No problem, I promptly did so.  They gave me a form to have my doctor fax, along with a letter from the doctor explaining the need and benefit for the accommodation.  I had requested that the workstation be off of the production floor, as parts of the production floor are varying levels of clean room, and as such can’t have certain materials down there that are common in office/organizational supplies.  There are empty desks/workstations in other parts of the buildings that I work in, that are also more central located (my physical work is across several departments in multiple buildings).

My doctor sent it in, I followed up with HR in early September 2019, and received confirmation that was received and was not given a denial.  I had informed HR my boss was already aware, they followed up with him, and told me he “working on it”.

In early October 2019 I followed up with my boss in our meeting and he told me that he had not gotten a reply from Jane (fake name), who is the person who does administrative assignments (such as basic office equipment, desk assignments, etc).  I had also reached out to Jane on my own separately in May 2019, and she directed me to my boss, whom I did speak to when it became a problem.

I have lost my patience.  There are empty desks, there are desks assigned to people who voluntarily left the company months ago that still have things on them, and I have not gotten any actual communication.  I went to the ADA to find out how to file a complaint, the website directed me that ADA employment issues fall under EEOC.  Went and filed with EEOC, did my interview, and EEOC rep determined there was enough to file a charge.

I dove into this job headfirst.  I’ve always had a hard time making work happen, which was answered by my diagnosis.  Once I started treatment, I was determined to turn this new position into a career (it has career prospects in logistics/industrial engineering), and wanted to become the absolute best I could be at it.  The months and months of perceived inaction and perceived procrastination have destroyed that, and before I filed for EEOC, I was looking for other jobs.


Here’s the actual question:  Would accepting a job offer from another employer impact this EEOC charge, and if so, how?  Obviously I won’t need the accommodation if I leave the company, but I feel that the company should be held accountable for mistreatment of those with a mental disability.  If this is how I’ve been handled after being specifically chosen for a role, I can’t imagine how the average employer at my former level is treated with mental disability/disorder.",legaladvice,t3_dkqzgu

"Disclaimer Creation for Community-Driven Writing ProjectHi, I manage a community-driven writing project that's been going for a few years. Our gig is that we have a larger lore completely written by the community. We have been going steady for a while, with submissions to our wiki every once in a while.

All entries so far have been from people I (or another moderator/high up member) know(s) well enough to know their merit as a person. But the problem is that we've gotten big enough (still not big at all) that we have virtual strangers that wish to add material to the wiki. I'm apprehensive because I fear some of these people might be the type that are willing to throw the project into legal trouble for using material they wrote. So, I decided I should write a legal disclaimer that writers are asked to read before their submission is accepted. I want to include the following conditions in the disclaimer:  
That submitted material can be used in all other material and media made through the project, describing the project, or made about the project.  
That the writer will not submit copyrighted/borrowed/unoriginal material.  
That the material, after submission, may be modified to conform with other sections of the wiki.  
That Material from a writer can be removed from our wiki upon request at any time.

"Can I record someone else in my own home when I'm not there?This is in NYC.

My landlord is selling the apartment that I'm currently a tenant in. My lease gives me the right to continue occupying the apartment for the remainder of the lease regardless of this situation. While my landlord's real estate agent will try to keep viewings to hours that I'm around like on weekends and weeknights, he may be conducting viewings during the workday.

I'm not completely comfortable with having strangers inside my apartment but I understand that it may be necessary to sell the apartment. While I do want it to get sold quickly so I don't have to deal with this mess, this is my home and I want to live comfortably. Also, I'm not getting any discounted rent or any other compensation to accommodate these viewings.

"Currently Being Committed Against My Will to Psychiatric Care after Visiting Campus Clincian about Anxiety Medication. Currently in ER, Soon to be Transferred to Inpatient Care where My Phone will be Taken From Me.The last 12 hours have been surreal. I am a college student in Boston, Massachusetts. I have been struggling with general anxiety and depressive symptoms since coming to college. I have taken and continue taking variety of measures including biweekly meeting with an on-campus counselor, group therapy, and self-care tools. 

With midterms, I found my anxiety and depression interfering with my work more I could handle. I have been asking my on campus counselor for a consulation on medication for weeks, but because of how disgustingly overflooded system, she told me I would only be able to see someone in early November (this is when I asked in late September). I ask other resources for help and I am told that seeing an urgent care counselor on campus and expaining how immediately I need to get help with medication can help expediate this process.

Come this Friday afternoon at 5PM, I check-in at urgent care. It takes an hour for the on-call clinician to arrive, and by that time the nurse tells me that another 3-5 people have checked in to see someone.

The urgent care counselor spends no more than 10-15 minutes with me. During this short time, I try to explain literally 2 years of mental health history as well as the nuance of what I was experiencing most recently. When asked if I have ever had suicidal ideation, I tell them I actually do have intrusive thoughts on occasion, but it is usually very easy for me to brush off. I described however that last night I felt compelled to look into reddit threads on r/suicidewatch and r/suicidebereavement. When he asked me to explain more in depth what I had read, I mentioned a thread about a student who had hung themselves with a electrical cord and the perspective of their friends who found them. Reading stories like that help me rationalize how violent and terrible the reality of suicide actually is and makes it a lot easier to see these thoughts as the irrational momentary escapist fantasies they are. I know in my deepest core that while I entertain these suicidal thoughts, I know truly that I would never seriously kill myself.

Unfortunately, this is where things start to completely spiral out of control. This urgent care counselor leaves the room and disappears 
for 20 minutes. When he gets back he informs me he is going to have me take an ambulance to a nearby hospital for emergency evaluation and possible admittance. I tell him this is not something I am comfortable and that it was an extremely unnecessary escalation. (I was also worried since I don’t know how the finances of this works out for me as I am a low income student) He says I have no choice as he is placing me under “Section 12”. After some wait where nothing more is explained to me about Section 12 (I had to google it to actually understand what its meant to do), I am escorted from my campus hospital in an  ambulance with an actual brigade of 5-6 emergency responders and police.

HERE IS MY BIGGEST POINT OF CONCERN. On the way to the hospital for emergency evaluation, I am taking to one of the ER responders trying to just stay composed and take in everything that was happening, she says “Just so this goes easier for my report later. We were told that the campus clinic recieved a call from your dorm last night (meaning Thursday night) where they were informed about you threatening to commit suicide. They mentioned something about the use of electrocution.” I immediately stop her there, I said no that is absolutely not what is happening nor was that what I told my urgent care provider. There was no phone call from my dorm about an attempted suicide. There was no attempted suicide or threat to commit suicide. I cannot understand where this idea of electrocution came from, besides the counselor misconstruing the example with the electrical cord from earlier.

I since have arrived at a local emergency care and spoken to an registration facilitator, ER nurse, and the psychiatrist on duty at this hospital I was transferred to. I tried to explain in more detail the context of everything I had told the counselor who placed me under Section 12. I tell them this initial report about a late night call and electrocution is just completely untrue. She says she will check, continues to ask more questions and eventually tells me I am being placed into impatient psychiatric care, with or without my consent as extension through Section 12.

I ask her more into what this means. I will be in involuntary care from 3 up to 7 days. I will be in a “secured” area with someone checking in on me every 10–5 minutes. My phone will be taken to limited access, but I can write down numbers and make phone calls through a provided phone. Limited visitation hours. I will be given daily counseling with a psychiatrist and medication from there.

It is definitely true that I have issues with anxiety and depression that needs professional help. Help which I have personally sought out and understand is in my best interest. I know how serious and how insidious mental health issues can be, and I feel educated to understand my level of risk where I would know if I needed to voluntarily commit myself for example. I feel I am being made to feel crazy. I cannot comprehend how I am being asked to stay for up to 7 days without consent.

I am at a loss for words how within 6 hours, I have gone from a student needing medication consultation to being stripped of my freedom, my clothes, and contact with the outside world at the word of a counselor who spoke to me for 10 minutes.

I have been contacting my family (who are overseas and cannot help directly) and furiously googling to understand my situation. This passage from Massachusetts Law Section 12 looks relevant.

“Upon admission of a person under the provisions of this subsection, the facility shall inform the person that it shall, upon such person's request, notify the committee for public counsel services of the name and location of the person admitted. Said committee for public counsel services shall forthwith appoint an attorney who shall meet with the person. If the appointed attorney determines that the person voluntarily and knowingly waives the right to be represented, or is presently represented or will be represented by another attorney, the appointed attorney shall so notify said committee for public counsel services, which shall withdraw the appointment.

Any person admitted under the provisions of this subsection, who has reason to believe that such admission is the result of an abuse or misuse of the provisions of this subsection, may request, or request through counsel an emergency hearing in the district court in whose jurisdiction the facility is located, and unless a delay is requested by the person or through counsel, the district court shall hold such hearing on the day the request is filed with the court or not later than the next business day.”

I was not told about my right to attorney. I was not offered chance to defend my ability to refuse admittance.

I am currnetly sitting in ER wing of a local hospital still. I am waiting for a bed at another facility so I may be transferred and begin treatment.

My questions are the following:

How long are they actually allows to keep me for? I have been in emegency care for 8 hours already. I overheard a nurse mention how beds may not even open up till Monday. Will I be waiting this entire weekend through to next week in an ER room with people genuinely screaming and yelling down the hall?

How do I talk to someone about what is going on  with this application of Section 12? I am completely  shocked that this is how little they need to put me in a room with security guards paroling me. By this standard, half the rest of my school and more than half of reddit should be admitted against their will.

"[VA] My building is currently under construction, converting from radiators to central heat/AC. The construction has been ongoing for about a month and we still don’t have heat. Temperatures have hit 35°F some mornings. Is there anything we can do as tenants?I’m a college student. This is my first time living off campus. My roommate and I live in a 102 year old house that has been converted into 6 apartments. Previously, the apartments used radiators in the winter and window AC units in the summer to moderate temperatures. Apparently, the radiators just got too old and the landlord was told they wouldn’t be able to start up again this winter, so for weeks we’ve been enduring construction (landlord’s handling of which could be a whole other post) to install a central AC system in each apartment. My terminology is probably off here, I know nothing about HVAC or what is really going on in the apartment. 

The important part is, the radiators have been removed but the new heating system still isn’t up and running, meaning we have no heat in our apartment. I don’t want to buy a space heater because I have 2 stupid cats who will probably start a fire, plus they’re expensive and gnarly on the electric bill, but I’m getting tempted due to how cold it’s been lately. The temperature around here dropped pretty starkly from 80s to 60s, with mornings being 35-50°F. It’s chilly. I’ve been wearing gloves while I play video games. My cats have been tucking themselves in to my blankets to keep warm, and one of them still managed to get a cold. I’m sure there’s some VA law that requires landlords to make sure our apartments CAN be heated, but given that she’s installing the system now, is she in the wrong? Is there anything we can do? 

Our landlord also has a history of ignoring us when we raise complaints. She pretty universally sucks. Is there a way that, if she is legally in the wrong here, we can make her take action without actually going to court or anything? I can’t afford a lawyer, or taking time off from school and work to go to court. I just want my apartment to be warm.",legaladvice,t3_dkem33
"Pinworms at my WorkplaceThrowaway account, first time posting here.

I work front desk at an activity center in my town in the United States. It not a big chain, just a local community activity center. Just for some background info- we have a day care that parents can pay for if they need someone to watch their child while they work out. Only one lady works day care and she often brings her toddler son and seven year old daughter.

So about a week ago I came into work and it was pretty slow at the front desk. My direct supervisor was there, she really likes to gossip and get into people's business, very nosy. Supervisor says ""Omg OP, did you hear about what happened with daycare lady?!"" I said no and my supervisor proceeded to tell me that the daycare lady just found out her toddler son has pinworms. If you don't know what those are, look them up. In short they are parasitical little worms that once you ingest the eggs they hatch and live in your intestine/colon area. They take a couple weeks to grow and once they do they  start to um.. crawl out of places. (Just look it up if you want to know more) They apparently spread fairly easily, especially with kids. Anyways, so day care lady's son has grown pinworms. Then supervisor tells me that the pinworms spread to daycare lady and her daughter.

 I obviously was freaking out because ew, but here is where I need legal advice. Our bosses (there's two) asked everyone if any of us could work in day care. They didn't mention the pinworms and after I talked to the rest of the staff in the building, I realized no one else knew about it at all. My supervisor said the bosses considered saying something to everyone and posting a notice on the door for customers to see when they walked in so everyone would be aware but they decided against it because they didn't want to scare everyone off. Is that legal? Are they allowed to offer a day care service and not inform paying customers who are parents with small children about a pinworm outbreak? Are they allowed to trick staff into working day care without telling us that there was pinworms?

They found out about it on a Friday, I heard about it the next Monday evening and by that point no one had cleaned the room yet. No one volunteered to cover the day care shift and they were pretty mad about it.

tldr: Coworker who works daycare and her kids got pinworms, it's likely they've contaminated the workplace. Management is trying to keep it a secret from customers and staff and they are trying to get me and other staff to work daycare without informing anyone of the pinworms.",legaladvice,t3_dkkc8c

"Who will get the houseI'm currently 19, living with my grandma because I wanted some Independence from my parents even though they're right down the road. My grandpa passed a few years back, so it's just me and her in the house, along with her two dogs. 

The problem is, my family has fallen apart after my grandpa passed. And the debate of who should get the house arose. It's down to me, and my uncle. Everyone thinks he should get it, but he'll turn this place into a chop shop and caused my grandma hell when he did live here, before being sent to jail. He, of course, is no longer allowed to live here because of past issues such as illegally buying and selling cars, and owning a lot of guns with shady people coming around. 

Since before my grandpa passed, I was told I'd be getting the house since no one else is interested on actually keeping it in the family. After he passed, I was told grandma signed the house under my name so it will be mine after she's gone. But I've found out that she hasn't done so, and is debating on not leaving a Will at all because it's ""too much work and will lead to more conflict"". I'm worried that if she doesn't situate everything herself now, there will be lawsuits after she passes since most of the family only wants to take everything she has now. 

I've almost been living here for a year, and plan on staying until she does pass at least, since she suffers with major depression and she just refuses to take care of the house. If she doesn't create a Will or hasn't actually signed the house to me, will me living here for an extended period of time mean that the house becomes mine by default? What can I do to prevent lawsuits and more conflict in my family? What will happen to everything if no Will is left behind?

I live in Washington State, and am sure that she has at least 20 years, maybe more since she does take care of herself.

"Estranged grandmother died, left us to a messThis is in Indiana.
Four days ago, my grandmother passed away. My father and I have not talked to her in over 10 years, she cut us off after many arguments about my biracial relationship and children...she was incredibly racist and did not approve, enough to move away and tell us to never speak to her again.

Anyways, she lived in a small apartment by herself that she rented and hoarded herself to death in. She had very little (if any) assets of value and no life insurance policies that we know of. No 401k or pensions, I believe she lived off of social security and a part time job.

We discovered her death from the landlord, who said my grandmother had listed my father as the emergency contact. He let us know that we absolutely needed to come to her town (100 miles away) and get her apartment cleaned out so that he can get it rented out again. He also let us know that we would be responsible for all damages that my grandmother had caused. From what he stated, my grandmother's body is located at the county morgue, awaiting family.

My question is, can we just ignore this entire situation and go on with our lives as if this never happened? My grandmother means nothing to our small family, and frankly, none of us really have the time or extra funds to deal with any of this. My father was an only child, and my brother feels the same as us, wants nothing to do with it. Can we be sued by the landlord (or the county holding her body) if we don't do anything?

"Bill for a streaming site I haven't used.Info about the location: I'm Swiss but the site is German.

So, my brother and I wanted to watch Pearl Harbor since he needed to write a summary about it for school.

Since we didn't have the movie and didn't find it on Netflix, we said fuck it and went to online streams.

Many sites didn't work until we found one that did. But they required an account for using fullscreen.

I thought ""Well, I'll just use a wrong username and my trash email."" Then they asked for a mobile phone number and I googled fake numbers since I was too tired to search for a new site at this point. Then they required to open an SMS they sent to... the fake number which obviously doesn't work. So I quit the process.

I searched for a new site which took some time but we could watch the movie succesfully.

Today I got an email saying ""Your free trial of our service has ended and thus we renewed your subscription for one year. A payment of 395€ is due in 3 days.""

I think I should ignore it, because:

1.) I never made an account. I left the site before that happened.

2.) Is a 3-day payment with automatic subscription even legal even if it's supposedly written in the terms of service?

3.) Would a streaming site with questionable legal status really ask authorities for the real adress like they said when they only have an IP adress?

4.) They gave the ""supposed coordinates of my device"" and that wasn't at all where I live.

5.) A big ""pay now Button"" and an ominous link to ""cancel something"" in an email seem really unprofessional.

"Possible PregnancyI have a friend who last month had unprotected sex with a girl from tinder who was visiting his state for a few weeks. They didn’t really talk until she told him about a month later, that she was pregnant and he was the father. She planned to take the pill to abort the child (I don’t know what the name of it is sorry) this last Friday. However, when my friend reached out to her and see if she went thru with it, she stops responding/contacting him. Basically, he’s stressed about not knowing whether she is keeping it or not. My question is: is there anything he can do to find out whether she is pregnant or not, or what his next steps should be assuming she keeps ignoring his questions?

"[NY] Old roommate has my kitchen table and I want it back but he is avoiding me.Im going to try to keep this really straight forward.

we were roommates for a year in like 2015/2016. we used my kitchen table and when we moved out, he put it in a storage unit because I didnt have any space for it. we tried to make plans several times the following year for me to pick it up but they always fell through for one reason or another.

fast forward to september 2019. I move into a bigger apartment and need the table.

I connect with him through text messages and we arrange a date to meet at his storage unit so I can get the table.

when that date comes around he completely ghosts me. wont open any Facebook messages to view them and will not answer or return my calls and texts. we're still friends on facebook so I can see when he logs in and i know his phone is still working because it rings when I call him.

to add to that, he never gave me back my half of the security deposit (~$300).

normally I would just write this up as a loss but the table was originally my Dad's from the 70's and he kept it for me to have when I got my own place. Now he has cancer and I'm not sure how much longer he has left so this table has become even more important for me to get back.

I want to take my old roommate to court over this. would I go to the City court of the city he lives in? It says online that I don't need a lawyer, is that a good idea?

I really don't care if I spend more money on this than the table is worth and I don't give a shit about the security deposit. This is now personal and I want to make his life as difficult as possible over this.

"girlfriend's parents had her sign a power of attorney document - should i be worriedMy girlfriend (19) has less than stellar parents. Generally just very controlling people. We are both on break from uni right now and her parents told her she had to do a document signing. It was a document solidifying their power of attorney. First in line is her dad, then her mom and uncle. 

My understanding is though that next of kin automatical have power of attorney unless a spouse is involved. So why sign a document to solidify something that is already automatic? Also is it normal to sign that for a child ASAP? Also apparently she felt very rushed. Her mother was like ""we already told you what it was, why do you need to read it?"" There was a lawyer there of course who confirmed that it was for POA but also didn't encourage her to read it. I just generally don't trust her parents and am... worried. 

Another thing I am considering though: This document would take precedent once she is married, so her spouse would not be able to make decisions unless this is changed. My girlfriend and I are lesbians and her parents aren't too keen on that. I'm worried that they're counting on us or any future partner she has not overturning this POA document because they don't quite approve of the whole lesbian thing.

Am I overreacting? Should we be worried? Or is this all run of the mill and I'm just anxious because I dont trust her parents?

"Wife tried to kill me and I want a divorceHello all, I thought I'd ask you all for some advice. First off, I'd like to state that this is about my parents. I'm in my mid-20s, as is my sister, so we're not really worried about custody or anything like that.

I think the best way to start off is to tell you the facts: my parents have been (were?) Married for 25 years. Over the years, they've had separations and even one previous divorce they later annulled. Things have always been rocky and earlier this year they decided to get Therapy. Part of the therapy was to give each other a letter asking for forgiveness for everything they can remember doing to each other that might've hurt them. It turns out they had both been unfaithful at different times. Both incidents were prior to 2002, and happened while they were separated.

My mother had mentioned this to my father years ago, but my father had not. Last week, he finally told her as part of the therapy. It did not go over well...

For about a week, she basically lived in what used to be my sister's room and they had zero contact. Last Sunday, he went back to ask for forgiveness one final time and she lost it. It got bad enough that she verbally threatened to kill him and threw a knife at him (and tried to pick it up to continue but by then he had left the house and was on the phone with 9/11). The police were called, she confessed on camera, and promptly went to jail for 2 days until I bailed her out. She has a felony charge for assault with a deadly weapon. My father didn't not wish to press charges and really only wants to move on from this nightmare.

The final hearing isn't until next month, and she's not living at home. My father is understand shaken by the event and does not wish to stay married. His main concern is her taking half of his assets, including an inherited beach front property.

Lawyers on reddit: how probable is it that my mother takes half of his assets? Is there a way the felony charge could figure into the divorce?

"Misdemeanor charge at a park after closingColorado. Looks like the voice recorder didn’t hear me say it for the title. Sorry! Still a Reddit novice, and not too great with the smartphone I was given yet either.

I was charging my electronic devices under a picnic shelter since the library was already closed when my charge block died, and my phone threatened to follow. (I’m a car-dweller with a nonfunctioning charger port / cigarette lighter in my car, and depression that ranges from “I screw everything up” to “if I could stand the pain, this knife would go much deeper” depending on the day).

Google said the park was open 24/7, and being new to Colorado at the time, I just figured they were awesome like that with some public parks always open. I was desperate in any case since I rely on my GPS for every turn I make, or near enough. There were a lot of people there when I arrived, and I admit, I managed to fall asleep while my stuff was charging. I’m frankly shocked I wasn’t robbed blind.

The police showed up after I had already packed my stuff into my car. I was getting ready to deal with a feminine hygiene concern in my passenger seat when they arrived. Five units. After a very tense, humiliating hour of questioning and so on, I was given this piece of paper that says it is a misdemeanor I am facing.

—What is the worst that might happen on (and resulting from) my assigned court day, bearing in mind I am a day laborer, officially considered homeless, and don’t have a bank account since I have no home address where I could receive a card?
—Is there any chance I may have to show up more than once in there?
—What do they do to people that don’t get legal representation, and what happens if they can’t make it to court on that day?

I’m terrified that my car, which is in need of expensive repairs I am trying to save up for, won’t even get me downtown. It would be just my luck / lack of stability / poor choices if my failure to take care of my car when the repairs were minor ends with me violating some rule where you’re automatically screwed if you aren’t there at court.

EDIT: It’s an unlawful conduct on public property thing. The vehicle isn’t mentioned on the pink slip. “To wit: #3, hours of use.” The number written is 18-9-117, if that helps.

He's saying he's going to get his lawyers involved (I will be consulting one as well) about taking action for my 'crossing of the red line'.

This girl, let’s call her Allison, moved into our house about three weeks ago.  She’s 19, everyone else in the house is at least 22. So far, she’s left food all over the counter, left her friend’s dog (which she’s not supposed to have here, no pets) out to bark and snap at anyone who comes near it, and now the best part: she’s planned a party at our house. She’s sent out a flyer. The grandma of one of the girls is the homeowner and handles all the leases. The girl whose grandma owns the house, we’ll call her Hannah. Hannah handles a lot of the roommate stuff. Allison went to Hannah to ask about the party, to which Hannah said “make sure you ask everyone else in the house before you do anything.” There’s a total of 5 people in our 5 bedroom house. Needless to say, she did not ask anyone and she is expecting “a lot” of people to show up, especially since she put out a flyer. She’s underage and plans on having drugs and alcohol for everyone. My close friend, who lives in the room next to me, found out about this party and we’re extremely uncomfortable with the whole thing so we told her and she got insanely angry at us. We still don’t know what’s happening with the party. Our options are basically to call the cops when people show up or to physically turn away every single person who shows up.

"Landlord hasn't stopped neighbors from smoking inside buildingI rent 1 unit in a multi-apartment building in Pittsburgh, PA.  At least one of my neighbors regularly smokes cigarettes inside the building, and the smoke smell comes through the heating vents and fills my apartment and disgusts me.  At one point I saw one of my neighbors smoking in the hallway.  My lease (and, I am guessing though I don't know for sure, all of the other tenants' leases also) prohibits ""careless"" smoking as well as smoking that causes harm to others, and states that anyone who does so will be held accountable for violation.

I left a polite note out on the front door asking fellow tenants to please not smoke inside the building, but my note was partially burned (presumably by a cigarette or cigarette lighter) and left on the porch.  I called the landlord several times after this, and after one of my calls he went as far as to put up a sign in the hallway telling tenants not to smoke in the halls....but there is still smoke regularly coming through the heating vents weeks later.  So, obviously my neighbor(s) will not listen to me, and my landlord either gave me a different lease than he gave the others or he is simply not enforcing the terms.  I have not been able to get a hold of him directly, only his receptionist, and the receptionist said that he would call me but he has not called me.  On one past occasion when he called me regarding a different matter, the caller ID and number were hidden.

I cannot afford fees for an attorney.

"Is this illegal?\[United States - NEW YORK\]

Hi everyone,

I just have a quick legal question regarding something I did years ago. Around 3-4 years ago, I was interested in nudism and the nudist culture, so I decided to do some research on it. I watched some videos about it on YouTube although I was concerned about one video. This one video I looked into that was a preview/trailer, although the link in the bio (which brought you to another website with this one video) was the full video. The full video had fully-nude minors who were running around. There was nothing sexual about it, and I don't think it was the illegal stuff. I vividly remember that the website had a section asking if the video was legal, and the website said yes as it was non-sexual and even gave an example on how if every parent who posted an image of there child in the bath would be arrested if it was illegal. I visited the page twice in the span of one week.

I'm still a teenager, and I'm going to be graduating soon. I don't want to have the thought in the back of the head that my life will be ruined because of this. I'm a good person, not interested in pedophelia or any of that stuff. I'm very disgusted by that type of stuff and have NO interest in it.

"My car was stolen, striped down, and now the tow company wants me to pay them for the tow and storage fee's. [California]Hello Reddit Legal, 

First time poster and I will try my best to include all details and not break any rules. Sorry in advance if my writing sucks. 

As the title says, my car was stolen a few weeks ago in San Francisco and I was notified yesterday (10/18) by SFPD that they found my car in Oakland. I had filed a Police report at the time of thief in SF and filed an insurance claim. Insurance basically told me that they could not help since I only had liability courage and not comprehensive. They closed the case. Fast forward to yesterday, I get a call from SFPD that they found my car in Oakland. Per their instructions, I went to the closest SFPD station and signed a ""vehicle release form"". I called Oakland PD afterwards and was instructed to take this form to the Towing Company located in Oakland. I get there, hand them my ID and form and request to see my car. The thief(s) had literally taken everything, wheels, bumper, seats, engine/tranny, even my workout shoes were gone. It was just scrap metals sitting in their lot. I am really sad at this point and I head back to their office. I ask the employees working the front desk what are my options here and they present 1) Pay $685 for amnesty (they explained it as basically the car will be their problem now) or 2) Pay ~$880 to take it home (obviously I was not interested in this option or was it physically possible). 

I asked for a breakdown of the $685 charges and from what I remember it was $385 (tow fees) + $300 (100/day for storage) = $685. I tried to explain that I was notified about the car's whereabouts hours ago and asked them to waive the storage fee's. Their response to that was I can pay the full amount now and battle the charges later. They said that they will continue to charge $100/per day it sits in their lot and after a certain amount of time (I think the lady said ~6weeks) they will place a lein on the car and send it over to collections. 

I am at a crossroad here and really feel like the whole situation is terrible and unfair. I really don't want to pay the fee's but if I don't have a strong case here, I may just have to. It is A LOT of money. 

Please note: I still have a copy of the police report I filed weeks ago, vehicle release form and a voicemail from the office dated 10/18. I also took pictures of the car at the lot.

"I fell and injured myself in June. Has it been too long to consider pursuing damages?I'm in Pennsylvania. On June 19, I slipped on an wooden outdoor staircase, and the fall aggravated an old back injury. I didn't seek medical care because my dad is a retired doctor and I mostly defer to him for my aches and plains. But since the fall I haven't been able to sleep comfortably, exercise, and I've generally been pretty uncomfortable and miserable.

If it's relevant, the staircase is part of the building where my boyfriend lives, and where I also lived for many years. The building is a restaurant with apartments above. The landlord owns the building and runs the restaurant.

Since I know the property owner and have always been on good terms with him, I haven't really felt comfortable with the idea of a lawsuit. But it's been four months and the pain hasn't gone away. The steps have always been a hazard (it's not the first time I've fallen down them) because when they're wet they get super slippery and often have algae growing on them.

I guess my question is if I wanted to pursue damages, has it been too long since the fall to be worth trying? I have one text message where I discussed the accident but otherwise no documentation.

Hope this post wasn't too rambling. I'd appreciate any advice you have to give me.",legaladvice,t3_dkqq4y
"I was hazed last semester of college, and I'm thinking of pressing chargesI am an athlete on the track team at my college, and I was hazed last semester. I ended up reporting it to my coach after a training trip to Myrtle Beach for the week. Some of the things that happened over the semester were sexual harassment, bullying, cyberbullying, forcing me to drink (I was 18), and making me sign a contract to get drunk with the members of my event group for 4 nights while on the trip (the consequences were making me eat an edible). My coach initially tried to have me meet with the two girls who instigated most of it, which I told her I was very uncomfortable with and and alluded to possibly quitting the team. She then reported it to the head coach, he talked to me about it, I told him most of what was going on, and the he said that he would have to report it to the AD. The AD reported it to campus police, they interviewed me and other team members, and then made a report (I have a copy). The situation then went to Student Conduct and they conducted their own investigation and interviews. I told Student Conduct and the police about the sexual harassment, and they basically told me that they weren't the right people to handle it. I didn't press charges at the time because I just wanted it to be over, but now I'm rethinking that. I just want to know what would happen if I did press charges, and what charges they would face?

"Question about pay amount/timing from job.Hi, I work at a large food chain in the Southeast (my location is North Carolina specifically). I began working on Sunday 10/6/19, and was told we were paid weekly. Checks were issued 10/14/19 and when I arrived to pickup my check, I was told by the manager on duty that I had to work a week in the hole before I got my check. I wasn't familiar with the term because I'd never been told that at another job so I looked into it and asked my state's Dept. of Labor about it, and they said the practice was only legal if I was told in writing before the pay date. I asked for my contract to review it and see if it was in any of the documents/employee handbook but getting ahold of the right person at the corporate office has proven a challenge. Now they are telling me that when I pickup my check on 10/21/19, it wont be for the hours worked of 10/6/19 to 10/21/19, but that the check I pickup tomorrow will only be for my first week (despite this being the end of my second week here, I started on 10/6).

"""Fault"" Fandango (CO USA)Hi! Got into an accident where an unocupied car was obstructing the lefthand lane of a major roadway (I70). Driver was standing out in the median at the time of the collision and I was unable to switch into right lane due to another driver maintaining that position. 

My insurance closed my claim (Progressive customer service is pathetic btw) without even speaking to me and found me at fault, shelling out over 6K for this chick's car. I do not even have my copies of citations and police reports while I wait for central records to process.

I am being told there is no way to fix this, as I hit an unocupied vehicle (cited for obstruction of roadway PER officer on scene). I don't know much about insurance as it pertains to deciding ""fault"" but I understand it might not be good for my premium in the future. 

So two questions: (1) Will being at fault here in the eyes of insurance really be a big deal? (2) Is there a way to get my claim reconsidered after I get my records?

"Parental rights in VA?So I have a cousin (20F) who is originally from VA. She moved to UT for a year and ended up getting pregnant (she doesn't know who the dad is to this day). She couch hopped her entire pregnancy and then her mom in VA ended up letting her come back and live with her.
 She had the baby in Jan and stayed there up until July because she said it wasn't good for her mental health and that my aunt's house had too many rules. (No smoking in their car, get a job within so many days, etc ..)   

So she went to a few homeless shelters with the baby and then ended up finding a family on Facebook to take her in. She seemed like she started to get things together, got a job, car, etc.... Then she decided that she was going to move out to Utah with her boyfriend (17m). All of us were under the assumption that she was bringing the baby and she didn't. She left it with this Facebook family. 

Now she is in UT living with these friends that she met on Facebook who live in low income housing. They kicked her out twice already since August and she's had to live in a motel a couple of times. She got in contact with my grandma in UT (who she's screwed over numerous times) to see if she can live with her for a few days until she can fly back out to VA the following. My grandma agreed since she figured she would leave Monday. 

Today (Sunday) rolls around and she tells my grandma these Facebook friends are letting her live with them again and she's not going back to VA and that her baby is staying with those people until she can fly back. 

My aunt called an attorney and they said that there isn't anything she can do because there is not grandparent laws in VA. And that the people who have the baby have a document saying that they are the only ones allowed to have the baby.

"Can my wife's insurance rates be impacted if I identify her as the driver of my speeding car?Apologies if this isn't the right place to ask this question. I thought about posting it in r/RhodeIsland because it's very state-specific but thought I might get more accurate responses here.

I live in Rhode Island, where the state's largest city, Providence, has installed speed cameras in school zones. About a year ago, I received a ticket after getting caught by one of these cameras, and I went to court to contest it. I believe *all* tickets received in this particular school zone are illegitimate, and during my hearing, the judge told me he thought I had a case -- the reasons why aren't relevant to this query, so I won't bother to explain. I ended up just paying the fine because I would have had to hire a babysitter to go to court again, which would have cost just as much. The important point is that while I was in court, I learned from the judge that receiving a speed-camera ticket cannot affect your insurance rates, as they can't prove it was *you*, the owner, operating the vehicle.

Recently my wife got exactly the same ticket in the exact same school zone. While the car she was driving is ""her"" car, I am its legal owner, so I received the ticket. We want to challenge this ticket for the same reasons I had the first time. But she was driving, and I can't go to court on her behalf. The summons includes a form to designate someone else as the driver; it must be notarized and mailed in, and that person can then appear in court. However, my concern is that *this identifies her as the driver,* and therefore the rationale for the ticket not affecting our insurance rates will be moot in the event that she's found guilty.

I'm not sure if state-specific knowledge is necessary to answer this question, but can anyone weigh in on whether it might be worth it just to pay the ticket instead of incriminating my wife and sending her to court?",legaladvice,t3_dku0s3

"(Iowa) Simple Assault and Minor in Possession

Throwaway for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old from Texas with no previous criminal history (besides a ticket I’ll talk about later) attending college in Iowa 

Last night I was celebrating a friends birthday in her dorm with a group of maybe 10 people and I was pretty intoxicated. A member of campus security (not a cop) showed up because of a noise complaint and started taking everyone’s ID. I made a very poor decision and lied and said that I did not go to the college and said that I was leaving the room. I tried to walk past the campus security officer (I was NOT attempting to make physical contact with him I was trying to walk around him) but he blocked me. This happened several times and I never attempted to make physical contact with him. Eventually the RLC came and I came clean and said I just was trying to not get in trouble. The cops showed up because the campus security officer claimed I “assaulted” him despite the fact that he was the one getting in front of me. I was arrested and charged with possession of alcohol by a minor and simple assault (both simple misdemeanors). I spent the night in jail but was given a court date and released this morning.

I elected for a court appointed attorney because I don’t have the funds for a private one but I might be able to get one if I absolutely had to.

I figure I’m pretty much fucked about the minor in possession since there was alcohol in the room and I was drunk but how do I handle this assault charge? How serious is something like this? Does what I did actually constitute assault?

I also am on deferred disposition in my native Texas for a speeding ticket so that it will not go on my permanent record. Can this offense compromise my eligibility for that given it’s in a different state?

I'm currently looking at an acre or so of land in an older subdivision in order to build a house on.

"(CA / WA) Company is threatening to fire me for reporting DiscriminationI have a really unusual situation. Our company is headquartered in WA, but I live and run an outside sales team in CA. The company has three owners, one of which I report to directly, I will refer to him as Chad (not his real name, but fitting). About 6 months ago, Chad decided to hire his wife (I will refer to her as Becky, also not her real name, but also fitting) to recruit and manage a team of lead generators that support my sales team. I don't believe the position that Becky was hired for was posted publicly, and Becky does not have any relevant work experience to do this job. The employees that Becky hires work at retail locations and local events, and their job is to schedule appointments for the outside sales reps that report to me.

Chad and Becky decided that it would be a good idea for Becky to hire a ""Team of Models"". The idea to only hire young, pretty women for this role was mostly Chad's, but Becky thinks it's brilliant. Becky has repeatedly passed on well-qualified applicants strictly based on their sex and / or age. The most recent example was an African American man who had recently graduated college with a relevant degree, and who has recent experience doing the same role in the same industry with a different company while he was in college. Becky referred him to me, asking if I would consider hiring him directly to my team, and said that she, ""just can't see a man doing well in this position."" I have tried to mention my concerns softly several times to both Becky and Chad, but it seems to fall on deaf ears. 

I finally decided put my concerns in writing to all three owners, because Chad is suddenly threatening to fire me for having a, ""negative attitude."" After writing an email with my concerns about their hiring practices, I got a call from one of the other owners. He started by trying to intimidate me, and then shifted to offering me a small severance if I would agree to, ""leave amicably."" I told him I would think about it. 

I then got a call from Chad. Chad asked if I wanted to work things out, and I said that I was open to it but that my trust is broken. He again offered me a small severance if I would agree to leave quietly, which I declined. He then told me that if I would write an email stating that my previous email was a ""misunderstanding"" that we can start with a ""clean slate"". He even had what sounded like a script that he wanted me to use to write the email. I told him that I needed some time to think about it. After thinking about it and consulting with my family, I'm definitely not writing that email. I would be lying to say that I do not believe that their hiring practices are discriminatory. If I write the email that he wants me to write, not only would I be lying to protect him, but I assume that he would then turn around fire me with cause.

"Terminated employee was overpaid now employer wants money back TX/ILMy hubby left a job back in August a few days shy of the end of the month. He was a salaried employee paid monthly. His last check was deposited in our bank account and I thought it seemed like he was paid more than I was expecting (he had used a few days of accrued vacation they were going to deduct from the final check) but I didn’t really think much about it. 

We got a letter in the mail yesterday from the employer that he was overpaid by 4 days and they want him to send them a personal check for the overpayment in the amount of $1129. The corporate office for the employer is in Texas, but he worked and paid taxes in Illinois. 

Any advice?  I actually have done payroll for the past 15 years but never would I send a letter asking someone to repay money if I made a mistake. Hence the reason I’m at a loss. The letter was mailed regular USPS - not certified. Hubby thinks at minimum we should wait until a certified letter comes, if ever.",legaladvice,t3_dkpj2a
"Bought a product online, chose ""incorrect"" shipping option by mistake even though checkout let me through, being told to cough up or I won't get my productI've recently purchased an expensive Fallout 3 vinyl set from Spacelab9. They had two item listings for the same product, one was for UK/EU postage, and the other for US/""ROW"" (rest of world) postage. Being Australian, I constantly get shafted on postage from the US, so I purchased the UK/EU option like usual. The checkout went fine, I paid $25 USD for shipping (reasonable compared to $67 USD), and waited for the vinyls to be pressed.

Fast forward a few months, I received an email from Spacelab9 stating that some of their stock was damaged in transit, and they would replace it with a ""rarer"" variant. I said that was fine. The next email I received stated that I chose an incorrect item listing, and must cough up another $42 USD for shipping to receive my vinyls.

I shot back that the checkout process did not show any warnings about this, let alone stop me from completing the transaction. As far as I know, our contract is now legally binding and they must send the vinyls for the price that I've paid, and absorb the cost of their mistake. Is this correct?

I'm already $220 AUD in the hole for this, and I really don't want to go for $300 AUD because they screwed up.",legaladvice,t3_dktzvc
"My dad was forced to live alone post brain surgery.My dad has lived 4 years with stage 4 lung cancer.  In the past 4 years he has been healthy and capable.  Then things turned downward, he could barely stand, and a tumor was found in his brain.  We were told he could have surgery and the inflammation would alleviate the spinal cord fluid and he would walk better and be okay.  Now, weeks after surgery, he was dropped from rehab and he lives alone. 
One, they never called me to pick him up.  His friend went to visit and called me to tell me he was discharged.  The nurses all believed he lived with family because he was confused and told them that was the case, but I've been on my own for over ten years, my sister is in MA (this is in PA), my mom divorced him over 12 years ago... So he has lived alone for 7 years at the very least.  The math is weird but my mom and him stayed in a house together for a while til things were worked out.  
My dad is a Latino American with a lot of pride and now, confusion.  He refused to move in with me and I really don't have the room.  He cannot afford a nursing home and he refused to leave.  I had to pick him up and take him home to his house which for a moment he didn't remember.  He thought for a second he lived in our childhood home as I drove him to his house.  
He has no memory of bills, mortgage, struggles to use the bathroom, medication, etc.  They discharged him early and I think they were wrong, but they didn't listen to me when I said it wasn't right.  I didn't know what to do so I just took him home.  I tried to make his 2 story house effective as a 1 story, and due to work I'm stuck not being able to be there all the time.  He is tech illiterate, so using a PC or phone is difficult pre-surgery, and he has never had a cell phone.  He is filled with Latino pride and refuses to leave now.  Do I have options?  Is there a way to prove he isn't capable of living alone?  Do I have a means of putting him in a place of care that doesn't bankrupt him?  He doesn't have much money.  I am coming from a place of desperation.  I can go along with him and leave him on his own, which could leave a corpse for me, or I can try to request help?  
I've looked into nursing at home which is over 300 a day in USD, which isn't affordable.  Nursing homes also take, sell homes, etc to make it work and he will run out of money.  What can I do?  Can I watch his finances?  Can I get him in care somehow without his approval?  He needs help.",legaladvice,t3_dkdys0

"Divorce while pregnant?So in the state of Texas they won’t grant anyone a divorce if there’s a pregnancy involved and I honestly find that ridiculous.

But I am currently pregnant with my boyfriends kid. Spouse was supposed to send me divorce papers for the last year but could never be bothered until I got pregnant. That really lit a fire under his ass cause he could be put as the father and made to pay child support.

"My friend has various mental problems and disorders but her abusive mom refuses to get her any medical help. VAIf there is a better sub for this issue, please tell me because r/legaladvice was the only one I could think of. 

My friend is fifteen, we are both high school freshmen. Obviously I don't know much about VA law. Basically, she grew up in foster care; it traumatized her and was the cause of a lot of mental problems/disorders. These include ADHD, anxiety, insomnia, and night terrors. She also has an eating problem where she refuses to eat more than 2000 calories a day and will not eat the following day if she does.

My friend was adopted by a woman who refuses to acknowledge that any of her disorders exist. She has physically and emotionally abused my friend. Friend has gone to a counselor to talk about her sleep issues/other issues and asked the counselor not to tell her mom, but she did anyway. This just made her situation worse. I'm not sure how long ago it was.

She admitted all of this to me yesterday but has begged me not to tell my parents. She says that if I do, they will be legally obligated to go to the police or call CPS. (I'm not sure if this is true.) The reason why she doesn't want police/CPS to be involved is because she doesn't want to go back to foster care. It was awful  for her and she doesn't want to be separated from us (me and two of our other friends whom she also trusts). I understand this, I don't think it would be good for her mentally. She has been borderline suicidal before and I don't want her to fall into depression again. But I also know that her home life isn't going to get any better.

Her plan is to make it through the rest of high school and then get all the help she needs when she is in college. This seems like a terrible plan to me because everything could get so much worse in just four years. She needs to get help immediately but without her mom's cooperation she really can't do anything about it.

"MA/Federal law regarding breaking lease for health/safetyMy partner and I are in the middle of leaving our current apartment because of smoking that is going on in and around the building, even though it is prohibited per the lease. I'm a 100% P&amp;T veteran and my partner has chronic asthma controlled by medication so we definitely can't just brush off the secondhand smoke looming into our apartment. I'm sort of new to MA but I come from FL where there is a tenant right to break a lease if the landlord does not fix or cure safety/health issues within 7 days of notification. 

Technically, our lease states we must give a 60 day notice to vacate and pay the lease break fee but the landlord has already broken the lease agreement by not acting on the multiple written notices from us stating there is smoke coming into our apartment. We provided them with multiple pictures of people actively smoking and they refused to take appropriate action laid out in the lease agreement. We have already given them a 30 day notice to vacate, which seemed reasonable to me being that they are not cooperating in fixing these issues - IMO 30 days is better than a 7 day notice. They responded saying we need to provide a 60 day notice and also pay the ridiculous $14k+ fee to move out - both of which I don't think we should be responsible for being that their negligence is the reason we're moving. We have even tried getting them to transfer us to another unit away from balconies but they weren't treating it as a medical accommodation - they still require about $9000 in fees to even transfer to the new unit. It's honestly ridiculous. 

Our lease does not state a specific notice we must give if we're vacating due to landlord breach of contract or because of health/safety/inhabitability/etc. We fully intend on the apartment filing for eviction (for ""abandoning"" the unit) or sending us a bill for everything they're demanding after leaving which we will definitely get an attorney for.

"GF's Brother getting charged with assualt.I just want to lay some things out.

Gonna call Gf's bro - 1

bro's friend - 2

I will try to explain to the best of my ability, I do apologize if I get the timelines mixed up or if I miss a few details. The telling of the story will only be from what my GF told me about what she has heard from others and has happened to her. (So an indirect telling of it)

Story:

1 &amp; 2 go out Friday night to party. They're out a few hours and start taking pictures with friends. 1 leaves the group, ends up running into his Ex and starts talking to him about how he's talking to other girls and convo turns sour. For some reason 1 hops into a car with Ex with a bunch of her friends and just 1 by himself without 2. So this is the part that the story isn't as clearcut, as 1 was drunk and doesn't remember. Anyway, 1 is found on the sidewalk by cops and is taken home. When he gets home his sisters try to help him out because he got bear maced at some point with the EX and got maced enough that he can't see. A few hours later cops come by and take 1, saying he's being charged with assault. He's currently in a correction facility and is waiting for court Monday.

A few details:

\- at some point, that night 2 calls sister(my GF) telling her about that night. He said that he saw the Ex talking about how she's gonna ruin 1's life on snapchat. 2 said that he recorded some snaps but I personally haven't seen them or know what they're about. 2 also says that she's psycho and is obsessive and she's been like that since they split.

\- Another thing that my Gf said was that she saw the Ex's snaps and that her face looked fine. I say this because Ex said to cops that 1 bear maced himself in the car with everyone in it. 

\- There was a supposed witness that said that she saw 1 beating one of the girls. but the witness knows Ex...

So that's all the info that I have for now. I was just wondering what your guys advice would be for this situation. 1 is not one to look for trouble, but does have a tendency to hang with people that do. The family and I believe he's innocent and that this Ex is actually crazy.

"Father withholding property that I own from me. Cops got involved. Texas. What should I do?Hello! First time posting here so apologies if something isn't right.

For added context, I'm a 22 year old male in Texas.

About two months ago, I voluntarily gave my expensive computer and  computer equipment to my father to let him hold on to so that I could focus on my college, worth a total of about $1100 - $1300.  I bought all the equipment with my own money.  It has been about two months since then and I have done very well in my studies, so I decided that I would talk to my father and tell him that I will be taking my property back.  After all, paid and built it myself.  Once I sat down and told him at the family house, he became extremely angry.   He then physically prevented me from retrieving my property by grabbing it himself and physically ramming me of the way, claiming that he was going to break it or hide it.  

After he rammed me, I tried to defend myself and my property.  It got physical.  My girlfriend called the cops and they came and put me in handcuffs and detained me inside a cop car. My father, who physically touched me first, was not.  Was talked to by the cop about how 'teens are too attached to their electronics' and that I was lucky that I had a cop like him.  I told the cop that I bought all the computer equipment myself, and even built it myself.  Cop said he 'couldn't prove who owned it' so I 'wasn't allowed to retrieve it'.

Long story short my father and I were both only ticketed for ""Assault C FV"" and my girlfriend was free to go inside the house and grab my phone and wallet but not my computer stuff. I wasn't allowed inside. Cop told me that if my father and I come to an agreement the judge might throw out the charges, or I can take my father to small claims court.  So as of right now, my father will not let me retrieve my property.  My girlfriend managed to record audio of most of the argument/ensuring scuffle, so I have that if that helps.

I just want my things back.  From the very beginning.  How should I go about doing this?  Small claims court?  Stolen property?  Does the cops getting involved mean I can't go and retrieve it myself now?  What should I even do in the court if we don't come to an agreement?",legaladvice,t3_dkbfqt

"Help: Security deposit witheld for 4 months and under former roommate's nameEdit: I am in Illinois.

Hello, I need help getting my security deposit back as it is still ""processing"" 4 months later and signed to a roommate that moved out. (Note: we are due the refund back according to managment so it is not simply that we did not qualify to receive it).I will try to keep this short. 

The former roommate moved out less than a year into the lease. He moved for the military and I confirmed that he did inform the office and go through the move out procedure at the time. We renewed the lease with just my partner and I on it for another year a few months later. We confirmed this person was off the lease. My husband and I have since moved out ourselves.

Managment, however, signed the deposit check to him (I found this out by calling them, we have not recieved any check from them). They now say that they have since changed the paperwork needed and that WE have to get the new paperwork to him ourselves or they can't change it. Additionally they cannot fix the problem until we recieve the incorrect check. They did assure me that it would be sent to our forwarding address and not to him directly. The paperwork shows that the security deposit was paid 100% from my partner and I's accounts. None was from the roommate. We even had to cover his rent the last month he was a resident because he decided not to pay. I do not want to contact this man as both he and his partner have threatened violence against us and I do not feel safe. I also don't understand how that was not taken care of and how it is our responsibility as they have been aware of it for well over a year and a half. 

We have not recieved even the incorrect check yet and it has been over 4 months but they have not sent anything. I called for the first 2 months and was just told it was processing. I do have a lawyer who I can get involved but would like to talk with them first as it would be expensive.

Please help. I would really appreciate any advice.

"(Canada) I was informally hired by a friend to perform somewhere, but after I did the gig he wants me to invoice the organization that was running the event for half my rate and accept the other half from him. Should I do it? More details in text.So my friend plays this weekly gig for $50 each session and when he asked me to fill in I said no because my rate is $100 for that kind of gig. He said (via texting) ""I could pay 100,"" and I accepted the gig. He emailed me and the organizer of the event saying that I would fill in and he said ""I will pay him 100 for this, as is his rate per hour."" The organizer made no contact with me until I emailed them to confirm the venue the night before, but I worked with my friend to prepare for the gig.

After I finished the performance the organizer said that she wouldn't be able to pay me $100 and that I should invoice the organization for $50 so that their grant officer wouldn't see anything fishy happening on her budget, and that she would get in touch with my friend to figure out how I would get the other $50. I told her that I would just invoice my friend since that was what I had expected. By now they've both told me that they think the only solution is for me to split the invoice two ways. I've never done this before and felt like they were trying to pressure me into something I wasn't comfortable doing, so now they're waiting and hoping that I cancel the $100 invoice I sent my friend and replace it with two other invoices.

I'm not happy about having to deal with this unexpected change in payment, which I think is part of the reason I'm hesitant to split the invoice.

So I suppose I have a few questions:

* Is splitting invoices normal?
* Should I just accept their change in payment method? Maybe I'm going too far with this? I feel like that would be misleading their grant officer and I feel like their budget should reflect the fact that my rate was $100, but maybe that's up to them and I should just accept their fishy two-pronged payment method?
* Is there any chance that I could get in legal trouble for not invoicing as they suggest?
* (I have no plans to take this to court, I would rather just not get paid this time and in future use contracts or at least be very clear with payment methods for future gigs, but) are my friend's text and email any kind of binding contract? Or did I just do this gig in good faith that I would get paid?

"NYC: Security deposit claimHi guys, my small claims case for my security deposit is coming up and I'm hoping to get some advice on how to win it.

1. I split a 2 bedroom apartment with my sister and her boyfriend
2. They lived there for about 2 years and I moved in for the last 8 months or so
3. Month by month lease

To be clear, we moved in to a dump. My landlady offered my sister $200 just to clean it up when she moved in. We did not take pictures of the apartment before we moved in, only after we cleaned up and moved out. Here is my landlady's argument (she just emailed me it)

&amp;#x200B;

1. harboring a cat into the apartment leading to contamination with cat hair and bad odor.
2. keeping the apartment and surrendering it back to me in an awfully dirty condition which lead to extra expenses. 
3. allowing the water in the toilet to run for your whole tenancy leading  to higher than needed water bills. That eventually also lead the toilet  cabinet falling apart and leakage into the apartment below which needed  to be repaired.

She also says she has evidence of all of this.

We did have a cat, but this court case is only for me and my portion of the security deposit. The cat was my sisters and I'm pretty sure I can claim I had nothing to do with it.

&amp;#x200B;

Probably important:

1. She never sent us an itemized list of deductions from our security deposit. This email was the first I've heard from her since our vacancy. From what I've read, if we had rented after July 2019 (it's a month by month lease, does this still apply?), if she didn't send us a list of deductions within 14 days of our vacancy we pretty much just win the case. Am I right?
2. No where in the lease does it state that breaking the lease results in the withholding of our security deposit.
3. The apartment was spotless when we moved out, except for the extremely old appliances that we inherited when we moved in. I have pictures of the apartment - there is no way the mess is worth the whole security deposit - there is no mess.",legaladvice,t3_dkkwxh

I am currently on bail after being charged and I am considering obtaining an abortion but I received unsolicited advice from the family of my former partner’s family insisting that I would be destroying evidence if I did.

Question - they have no say, right? Even if the baby is evidence of a supposed crime, I can still get an abortion because it is my body right? My lawyer says I am within my legal rights but I cannot afford a second opinion so that is why I am asking here.

Edit: if I have an abortion this prohibits the court from introducing my pregnancy as evidence, correct? Because it is my personal medical info and also because it cannot be proven whose it is?

"Can you be taken back to court for custody after custody arrangements have already been agreed.It's a long story in full so I'll just stick to the basics. My ex partner is a manipulative and abusive person. Alot happened while we were together that made me dread waking up every day I just didn't want to be here here any more because of his behaviours. Finally I managed to part ways from him without him threatening to kill me which was his usual you will stay tactic. Managed to convince him to part amicably as we have a child. So did my best to make sure their relationship didn't suffer despite my own relationship with him. Skip forward a few months he decides he wants me back there's alot of emotions and black mailing threatening to kill himself all that bollocks but I stand strong and don't want to get back into that world. I told him straight no. I'm done. He's drunk one night banging the hell out of my door and because I refuse to let him in to speak about things breaks in and attempted to kill me. I stopped contact between him and my son. Few months later I slowly allow him to have contact again but only because he bullied me into it. He came to collect some things from the house a while later but I wouldn't let him in without a witness. So he takes what he is taking for that day then comes back in locking out the person that was with him. Starts again with we need to get back together blah blah by this time I'm with someone new ( this is months down the line) someone who's really lovely an dive known my whole life and truly do love and cherish that relationship. My ex starts about how my partner doesn't really know me like he does and all that bull. Anyway I told him it's not happening I'm happy and even if I wasn't with my partner I wouldn't get back with him. He exploded kicking off again and I'm trapped in my own home pleading with him to leave. He snatched my son away and when he came back a few days later he's covered in scratches and cuts. I contacted my support worker and the school and we all report it to social services. There was a long drawn out process but when it was over they said that he's not deemed as a threat and he's saught help for his issues so he should be allowed supervised contact. So that went on for a little bit and I got a summons to court for a custody hearing. I of course got custody but bar the 2 main things there I've mentioned and a harassment case just after,   nothing from the relationship was recorded with police. So he got to have the typical every other weekend with my child. I wasn't happy but as long as he wasn't hurt again there was nothing I could do. Now he's got a new job and he's basically messaging me telling me that I need to throw away the court order because it doesn't suit him and I need to bend to his will or he's going to take me back to court. Threatening to take custody again. Now as far as I believe he wouldn't be able to but I just want to know if it's possible that if he doesn't get his way and I ignore his demands outside of the agreement can he take me back to court?",legaladvice,t3_dkh1ln

"Student Loans: Is it legal to send employment contract to Student Loans Company, given the contract is confidential?Hello, thank you for taking the time to read.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, as the title states, what is the legality behind Student Loans Company (UK) asking for payslips and a copy/scan of the employment contact I currently have, in Bulgaria? 

The contract itself is strictly confidential, but the SLC openly asks for it as a way to prove my overall income per each year.

The problem is, my last 3 payslips (which are considered proof) include referral bonuses, and when I last sent them these bonuses were, of course, calculated as part of my yearly income, but in reality they are one-time things which will not occur again during next year, artificially inflating my income on paper.

I've talked to SLC and they assured me I can send the employment contract on its own, which only includes my normal salary, and it will be used for re-calculation, significantly lowering the monthly payments I would need to do over the next year.

Can I get in trouble if I send them the contract, is it a good idea at all? I am curious why they even ask for it if it's illegal to share it with anyone due to confidentiality. I don't want to risk legal action taken against me from the company I work with.

"Update to eviction notice over $6.00 utility billFor context, this is in Michigan. One if my roommates has lived here for years, myself I’m newer here but I was only late on rent once. 

I posted sometime last week about an eviction notice my roommates and I received. I was told that I must pay $6.00 for utilities or I would be evicted. I thought this was a bit over dramatic, surely no one would actually go through the eviction process over a meager $6. Right? In my last post it was suggested that it was just an automated email and something was being miscommunicated. 

For more context, they do not accept cash, and to pay online, they would charge a $20 fee. None of us are very excited to pay this small sum on its own. 

I went to the office and they said “utility bills do not accrue late fees”, “I do not need to pay it before next rent is due”, and that the purpose of the email (a small detail that was not included in any of the emails themselves) is that we need to put our utilities in our names. They also told me that once the utilities are in our names, the $6 will be dropped from our account. 

So I proceeded to not worry about it. I was told they weren’t going to evict us, and we didn’t need to pay until the end of the month. 

Until today, someone from the office left a paper document saying we have 7 days to pay this $6 or we will go to court and be evicted. This was not just an automated system, this was signed in pen.

"I just moved, and a neighbor putting up flyers accusing me of being a child molester. I am not. New York State.So I moved into a new neighborhood in August. Shortly after I moved in, flyers started appearing on utility poles etc, alerting the residents that a child sexual predator has moved to the neighborhood. The flyer contains a cropped screenshot of the person they are ""mistaking"" me for's entry on the sex offender registry - we do share a name, but that's it. My name is not uncommon - I'm not Joe Smith but I am not Eusebius Cadmarenious either. Either way, the person posting these is definitely aware of the fact that it's not me, as they cropped the offender's mugshot out of the screenshot and replaced it with a picture from my LinkedIn profile. I have looked up Not-Me's entry on the sex offender registry, and he's a fat white guy in his sixties. I am an average build mixed dude (who looks black) in my thirties. And to be clear, while there's no such thing as a minor sex crime, this guy is on the registry for forcible rape of a child under 13 or something along those lines.

I spoke to the police as soon as I found out about the flyers via my wife, which must have been a fun surprise for her to see when she was walking home from the train. They basically said ""that sucks but how do you expect us to find out who is putting them up?"" I was confronted by a neighbor yesterday; luckily I bookmarked Not-Me's sex offender registry page on my phone, and the guy who confronted me was level headed enough to immediately apologize. He knew who was putting the flyers up, gave me the guy's name and described him as ""kind of a conspiracy nut."" Great. The abundant misspellings and CAPS for EMPHASIS on the flyer should have tipped me off. Anyway, I have no interest in confronting this guy myself, because there's a very low chance of the interaction ending in any manner that involves all of his teeth remaining in his head. I called the police again, and this time their take on it is more or less ""well being wrong isn't a crime, just keep taking the flyers down when you see them and try to ignore it.""

Hi all,

Throw back about a month ago, I had some contract work done at home. There were various contractors over throughout the day. I was home most of the time but I wasn't around the work site or keeping an eye on them the entire time. At the center of the work site, I had a smart device (about $100 value) set up. I rarely use this device so it's only until today that I realized this device is no longer there. This alarmed me because no one else has entered my home since.

I went search in my email and found that on the evening after the contract work, I received an email telling me someone was requesting permission to join my home device. That email had someone's first and last name in it. A couple days later, a new email tried to access it again.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my thoughts/questions:

\-Where should I start to take legal actions?

\-I can likely identify the contractor using the name in the email address but I won't directly contact anyone from the contract company

\-I can probably claim my loss with my homeowner insurance, but I guess I will have to file a police report?

\-Is this theft value too small for the police to investigate?

"I’m realizing I might have been sexually assaultedEdit: don’t know why this is labeled and finance and business and don’t know how to remove that. Sorry. 

When I was a senior in high school and into my freshman year of college I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. There were a few “incidences” that have haunted me over the years as I’ve looked back on them. One in particular I wanted to ask about. I went on a family trip with the boyfriend to Ohio with his parents. We stayed in a hotel and his parents got me my own room and put it under my name. Right before the trip I got a horrible cold and was terribly sick but went anyway. After a family event one evening, I went back to the hotel with his parents and went to bed while the boyfriend went and partied with his cousins. I went to the hotel, took NyQuil and passed out, deliriously sick.  At some point late at night or early in the morning, he got back to the hotel (I found out later he was high on cocaine) and talked the front into giving him a key to my room, saying he was staying with his “Aunt ****”. Basically he came in and had sex with me. I remember being so sick, 99% asleep and delirious from the fever and medication that I couldn’t think straight enough to “care” but definitely didn’t participate. I was asleep through most of it. 

 I don’t remember if I had turned 18 at the time of the event. He was three years older. This was about 15 years ago. I don’t know what I said if anything at all in terms of consent but I don’t think i was really in a place to consent consider how sick and medicated I was. 

I don’t know what this qualifies as from a legal perspective. From a personal perspective I’m realizing over the last few years how it has affected me. Sometimes when I’m sick and have weird  dreams, as I think many people do, I dream I’m being sexually attacked.

Not sure if this was true or not, I called the county clerk to see if the will had been given to the courts. Luckily, they had just been filed and the clerk gave me a copy. It does indeed state that we are to get everything (of course what’s left over after all her debts and taxes are paid). 

My sisters and I do not want to sell the home, but the Personal Representative, our great uncle, states that we absolutely have to sell the home and liquidize everything. 

We setup a meeting with him to talk about some details and get some questions answered. He was less than forthcoming with information and refused to answer any questions that had to do with how much we were dealing with in terms of money. He also refused to give us his attorney’s name. We asked why and he just simply said “I’m not going to”.

After going to my grandmother’s home, the entirety of it had been picked through and several things were gone. We found out that my great uncle and great aunt had an estate sale last weekend without telling us. The listing for the sale is on garage sale sites online. 

Long story short, he lied to us several times during our meeting and kept contradicting himself. So, my question, what do we do? There are several more details that I didn’t add in, but ultimately shouldn’t he be working with us instead of keeping us in the dark and if we all agree about the house, why does it need to be sold? The will doesn’t specify her assets have to be liquidized. 

Sorry if my thoughts are scattered I’m just a bit frazzled from the meeting. I also wanted to mention that we are in the US.",legaladvice,t3_dkh72k
"Woman we were going to adopt from is with holding kitten.Hello legal advice. Recently my family and I were going to adopt a kitten, my friend works in a clinic with her mom and this woman brought in a kitten says that she doesnt have the funds to take of her so I happily stepped up and offered to adopt her.

Two weeks go by and I finally meet the kitten and I fall in love with her. She was the sweetest thing and we started buying things for her. The lady wanted her and the kitten to meet our dog, which she did then told my mom she would keep her two weeks longer.

Fast forward today, I texted her to find out how the car was doing, as she had to get some final medical things before we could adopt her. The lady said she had a heart murmur and that she's not going to let us adopt her. We have everything ready for her, but mom calls bullshit on this reason and I want to know if theres anything I can do legally.

TX common law marriageJust curious what it takes to be married under common law in Texas. All my research says you just have to live together as a couple for a year but that seems too simple.

"Help abused animal. What do I do?Some back story before we get to the animal abuse part so you can understand what I'm dealing with here...

So about a year ago my sister's ex broke things off with her. She was dating an emotionally abusive man with a religious cult-like family who is extremely secretive. Looks pretty on the outside but on the inside the family are all brainwashed and abused. The mother of her bf is entitled and takes all their paychecks for herself then rules the family with an iron fist. There are 12-13 of them all living in one house. We tried really hard to stay in contact with her but as we didn't know where they lived/she would ignore our texts/phone calls and I had to go to her work to even speak with her. He prevented her from most contact with us and would read her phone and Snoop to anything we said to her. I personally cussed him out multiple times and he hated me especially because I wasn't falling for his bullshit. Finally recently she has seen the light and admits he is probably a sociopath. 

Fast forward to current times.
The family moved to a new house and has been using the neighbors facilities as apparently there are rats in their well. Gross. Also said ex boyfriend has a new girlfriend with a child and she has a dog. Now I'm guessing he is implementing the same emotional abuse in his new relationship as he was with my sister. My boss is friends with the neighbor and she came into my work the other day and notified my boss that she saw two of the boys in their family holding the dog on a leash and beating it. There are four brothers and they look similar from a distance so she couldn't say exactly who beat the dog but she stated she was thinking about not letting them use her bathroom any longer because of what she saw. I mentioned it to my sister and she tearfully admitted that while she was living there she had a hedgehog and didn't notice it had stopped eating its food. She found it dead in it's cage one day and thought it had just passed on. Later on he ex told her he had broken it's leg on purpose because he hated it and that it couldn't reach it's food bowl because of it. It had starved to death. She also admitted that he confessed when he was younger he abused his brothers dog and hung it repeatedly in their barn over a beam with a moose until it almost passed out multiple times. She was terrified of this man and so didn't say anything to us or anyone else. I can't stand the thought of him doing this to that girl's dog. I don't know what her full name is but I don't think saying anything to her specifically will help as a husband of one of the exs sisters has already tried to talk to her and tell her he's scared for the dog and she brushes it off! Someday I believe his abuse will escalate towards her and possibly even her daughter. There is no evidence except word of mouth right now unless I go steal the dog idk what I can do as far as legal wise trying to get it safe. Everyone in town thinks their family is so amazing because they do alot of volunteer work and they fake nice very well. Are there any options anyone knows of other than calling the police with no evidence except an eye witness? I can't bear the thought of this dog dying and being tortured but I don't know what to do at this point their family is crafty and all about appearances so they don't make mistakes like this often.

"my friend fell for a life-threatening scam and i need advice ASAPHey guys, i'll keep this short by putting it into a bullet list:  
\- (3 years ago) I told my coworkers I was quitting my job to marry my wife in Ukraine  
\- my now wife and I had a distance relationship but we had met before when I visited Ukraine 4 years ago  
\- my mentally unstable coworker (we'll call him John) told me about a month after my announcement he met a Ukrainian girl online and they started dating  
\- he showed me her picture and we (my coworkers and I) informed him it was likely a scam  
\- he resisted our warning and it was never brought up again  
\- (last week) my coworker informed me that Joe quit his job and has booked a flight to come meet this girl in Kiev, Ukraine 7 days from now  
\- i spoke with Joe and he is adamant that she is real and there is nothing to worry about  
\- asked who will meet him at the airport and he said, ""her dad is in the hospital and a man in a limo will come to pick him up because she always gets driven around in a limo""  
\- my coworkers and I are now throwing around ideas about what to do (taking his passport, hiring a PI, contacting Joe's wife who is unaware of the affair, me meeting him in the airport and taking him across the country to Lviv)  
\- despite several people telling him it is a scam he refuses to listen and will certainly leave

"School Suspension--Wondering if Charter appliesHello. Two days I got suspended for a short film I shot outside of School that was deemed offensive. The film was called (n-words) on the beach by a friend but I referred to it as Kidz on the beach. The Vice Principal had informed me that I had actually referred to it using a racial slur and had targeted kids who were mentally inefficient to join a short film I was part of. At the time I had not known they were mentally inefficient because of the interactions between them but nevertheless, I was accused of targeting them to join the film. I never gave details of the film unless I was outside of the School during home hours (After 3:05 since that is when School ends). All this put together is a reason I was suspended for two reasons. The other reason I was suspended was that the Vice Principal assumed I had created an account that parodies another student while involving other students in text-based story's. I caught wind of the account and had not brought my phone on Friday due to the daily activity of the account during School hours however despite the activity of the account and the absence of my phone, the Vice Principal accused me of using another person's phone to become active on the account. I mentioned to the Principal that I knew who it was and mentioned some other things. I mentioned that before the account was created, the friend who I knew owned the account told me the account was going to be basically, ""I dropped my pencil today but my friend (NAME OF FRIEND) picked up the pencil and saved my life"" but the account then got turned into talking about students and teachers inappropriately after they received the pictures. The VP had told me that he assumes I own the account and even if he were to go with my story, I contributed images to the account which makes me a co-owner of the account. He then goes on to tell me that he had found my Private account and noticed that 2 accounts I own (A meme page account and a private page account) mean that I am breaking Instagram's ToS of not being able to own more than one account and demanded that I delete the account which I do not want to own immediately. Another thing to note is that last year when I had gotten in trouble for saying hello to a student I did not know in the hallway which was viewed as mocking them (I said hello to everybody in the hallway) he informed me that he would be harder on me next year (in reference to this year). All this aside I am wondering if he can be affected by the charter like the right to remain innocent until proven guilty, a fair and unbiased trial, the right to not be unreasonably searched (He had searched through my phone after taking it from my hands and had gone through other peoples phones looking for the phone number of the other student (friend) who doesn't attend the school anymore) and possibly any other sections. If I am not protected from the charter, can I do anything? Currently, I am suspended from School with no date given of returning back and told by the VP, ""and that's if you even do come back"".

"Lawyer engaging in predatory proselytizing (US-CA)This is in California.

I have a very successful criminal defense lawyer who is putting a lot of pressure on me to convert to their religion, under the general assumption that it's already my religion and I just don't know it yet. Even my relatives who are of the same general faith are uncomfortable with how this lawyer will hold forth, but are also astonished at my audacity to complain in my situation. The fact that I'm in a very weak position to complain is what makes me feel so violated. I categorically have a problem with how this lawyer takes advantage of their clients' vulnerability in order to swell the ranks of their faith. I suppose I'd rather be a fake convert than a prison inmate, but it wouldn't take much digging on social media to raise doubts in court about my sincerity. I've read that it's not always easy for attorneys to quit, and can be ordered to stay on the job. If my lawyer sabotages my case it lowers their success rating and leaves them vulnerable to a malpractice suit by me. Or so I speculate, but clearly I'm here because IANAL. I don't want to dismiss my lawyer, I just want them to stop being so heavy-handed because it's making me extremely uncomfortable.

In my position would you bite your tongue, dismiss your attorney in favor of another, or frankly tell your lawyer how uncomfortable their approach is making you?

"Best route in breaking a lease due to secondhand smoke (Boston, MA)For background, my boyfriend and I have lived in this ""luxury"" apartment building for about 4 months. It is a 100% ""smoke-free"" building and every tenant is required to sign a no-smoking addendum in their lease. Secondhand smoke is a huge problem for us here, I'm a 100% P&amp;T disabled vet while my boyfriend is a chronic asthmatic requiring multiple medications to control symptoms. While the secondhand smoke aggravates most of my conditions, there is no direct evidence I can show in court proving such harm has been done - and same for my boyfriend, he just has asthma medication prescriptions he takes. There are 0 ""no-smoking"" signs in the entire complex - including the elevators. The building is staffed and there are employees present most hours of the day. I have taken pictures of people actively smoking on their balconies and submitted it to management twice - they apparently ""talked"" to them about it but they continue to smoke. Management promised the first time we wrote them that they would send out an email and post signs; they even acknowledged the photo of our neighbor actively smoking and did nothing. A month later and there was no change. Matter of fact, a dude across the courtyard is ripping on his bong as I write this.

Last week, I submitted a 30 day intent to vacate due to the landlord's negligence in curing these issues; it's all just a big health hazard. Not to mention, the landlord is not conducive in fixing the problem even though they advertise the building as ""smoke-free"". The building manager replied and told us we can't break our lease and that if we leave we'd be responsible for the remaining lease. Instead of handling this himself, the manager passed the issue to his assistant manager, who then had us meet with a leasing agent, which made no sense but we figured they'd allow us to transfer to another unit away from balconies. We met with them this morning and they told us they'd be happy to transfer us to another unit but we would have to pay back concessions ($8600) and pay the transfer fee (\~$5000). They even explained how we'd be responsible for the remainder of the lease (\~9 mo x $4400/mo) if we chose to just leave. MA has no statewide law prohibiting smoking but the City of Boston does, I just can't find the exact law. We are desperately trying to get out of this apartment without having to pay through the nose in ridiculous charges, not to mention the possibility of an eviction being filed if we ""abandon"" the unit.

"Started orthodontic treatment on Care Credit. Stopped paying a few years ago due to hardships at home, how do I begin to fix things now? (CA)Want to keep it concise on here. For full story, feel free to check out my post history.

The short version is that a few years ago, I started Invisalign treatment then quit pretty early on in the treatment plan because things happened in my life that caused me to no longer be able to pay for it. I could have handled it better, I know, but here we are. 

Originally, my application was denied by Care Credit via a letter to my house but the ortho said it went through, so we began treatment. I stopped paying altogether and did not do the treatment. In the aftermath of me not paying, the Care Credit financing office called me a few times to try and collect payment and I heard nothing from my orthodontist's office. 

I want to fix all of this now and get back on track and restart my treatment. I want note that I am in a better place financially now (minus the Care Credit thing) to be able to afford payments regularly.

I am genuinely at a loss of how and where to start fixing this.What are my options now?  Who should I go to first? Do I call Care Credit and settle on the original payment plan then try to re-apply for a new one to start a new treatment plan? Do I go talk to the orthodontist office first instead?",legaladvice,t3_dkhlqv
"Inundated in Automated Speeding Tickets - What to Do?My wife and I  moved to the DC area a few months ago. We recently started to receiving almost daily automated speeding camera tickets for $200-400 a pop from violations back in in August. My wife is not an aggressive driver (quite the opposite), and most are for minimal amounts over (12 MPH). She is a teacher, and apparently there is a camera on her route to school, as the tickets are all from the same location on her commute. She has obviously stopped speeding (read: she now drives slower than the normal flow of traffic), but we are already about $2000 in on speeding tickets, and she has been driving this route for months. 

We are worried we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg here. The tickets took a long time to get to us because we have mail forwarding set up from the address the car was registered in to our new DC address and things take a while to process through the forwarding system. So the fear is we could end up 10-20k in the hole by the time the tickets catch up to us. I feel like we are caught in some odd glitch of the system and there must be a way to handle all of these violations in a more holistic manner. My feeling is that though persistent, the violations are not egregious. I don't think our local gov't is intending to bankrupt normal citizens with their traffic cameras? Would there be some sort of way to go in front of a judge or go through some sort of appeals process to deal with this?

 I think the argument would go like: Yes, she was speeding, and she should pay a fine. When she learned she was speeding, she stopped. But the system was set up in such a way that the time between her getting fined for speeding and learning about her speeding was so long that she unknowingly racked up 4-5 figures of speeding tickets. We wouldn't be contesting any one of these tickets, but making an appeal to be relieved from an excessive and unusual situation. We are pretty desperate at this point - I would love any advice or experience here.",legaladvice,t3_dkoj59
"Can I leave my lease early due to my housemates behaviorIm renting a room in a house in California. I've been living here for less than a month and the lease doesn't end until June. However I already want to leave because of the living conditions that I didn't expect. I live with 3 dogs (all belong to my 3 housemates). Due to this the house smells like unwashed dog and they don't seem to care or want to do something about this. The dogs are loud, running around, playing with loud toys all outside my room. The walls are thin and the floors hollow so I can basically hear everything. The TV, music, dogs playing, people walking around, etc. This has made it very hard for me to sleep. I have tried earplugs/headphones but they dont block the noise fully. I should note that i need a quiet place to get good reat. I can only get about 5-6 hours of sleep per night which is affecting my health, I now get many headaches and find it harder to focus in school. The dogs sometimes walk around in the middle of the night waiting me up and I can't fall back asleep for a couple hours. And then they wake me up at 5-6am (there's a doggie door that makes a lot of noise when they use it since it snaps shut and it's right outside my room so it wake me up every time they use it). The lack of sleep and noise has been by far the worst part and I dont think I could make it more months. Do I have a case to leave my lease early?

"Can I file a restraining order?I think I need to file a restraining order. 

I'm 18 years old, I live in the state of Illinois, and I have PTSD because I was raped in 4th grade by another 4th grade boy. He's also 18 now, and I found out yesterday that he has a job working at my old high school. I'm genuinely concerned for the safety of each and every student he encounters. My little brother is also a student there.

I've heard that this man has been creeping out all of the other students. He walks up to groups of students and awkwardly forces himself into their conversations (usually he tries to be the alpha male by physically one-upping other student, which is gross because they're mostly 15-year-old sopmores), but yesterday he physically pulled my 15-year-old brother towards him by grabbing onto his shirt sleeve as he was walking by. He said he wanted to talk to my brother. My brother visibly didn't want to talk to him, which is why he was walking away and ignoring him. 

My brother doesn't know I was raped, and I don't have any physical evidence to prove I was raped. I do know that one of my friends was also raped by the same person in the 4th grade. I also think there are other people I don't know about.

I'm concerned for my brother's safety. The person who raped me is now a very large man who doesn't take no for an answer.

Should I discuss it with the school? Is there enough evidence for a restraining order? What do you recommend?

"[MI] Was ""Banned"" From An Arcade for 'Winning Too Many Tickets'. Did NOTHING Illegal. Won't Give Me My Money Back or Item Which I Redeemed For.I had been going to a certain arcade consistently for about 16 months. They have been offering prizes for a set amount of tickets. There have been several games in which I am skilled at and can win jackpots enough to get those prizes. 

The fiasco of this was the fact that their card system began to have problems, and showed me different card values for the three locations. I usually check to see how many tickets I have from each location. Normally a proper card system would be able to show me all of the tickets for that company total for all of the locations. This specific arcade did NOT. I, along with a friend, found out that the card did not link up, and that there were different ticket values at all of the locations which had a card system. Either way, I found out that I had different ticket amounts in the three locations.

On Thursday, September 19, 2019, I went to the first location (will called it Location A) and turned in many card sets to give me 8,000 tickets. In addition, I played my favorite game - Bean Bag Toss - and won a considerable amount there, so I left Canton with 92,000 tickets. I went to a second location (Location B), and played a few games of Quik Drop. I checked my card and saw that I had 61,000 tickets, so I was a little elated. I instantly redeemed 50,000 of the 61,000 tickets for a Nintendo Switch. They took down my phone number, and I was on my way. I went back to Location A and saw that my 92,000 tickets were still there. Which meant that I had won different ticket amounts at different locations. (In all honesty, I had been to BOTH locations and I - along with my friend - asked why they were all different ticket amounts at different locations, and they said they would deal with it - yet that was MONTHS before all of this even happen, probably around May or June of 2019, so I went with the different ticket amounts at different locations). Nonetheless, I went back to Location A and redeemed for a PS4 Pro.

Everything was fine, until September 26 happened. I go to a third location (Location C) and was about to load $100 on my card to play again. Suddenly the employee said that my card was locked. I wondered how. And even the employee saw that I had 63,000 tickets on my card. Think about it. There were STILL 63,000 and I redeemed for a Switch AND a PS4 Pro? So I blew it off and thought maybe there was some type of error that happened. So I get another card and put $100 on it. Everything was fine.

I called the corporate office on September 27, asking about the issue about that specific card. They said they would give me a week. All good. Good thing I got the other card. I took a break from that company and went to the other arcades.

On Thursday, October 3, I go back to Location C. The employee saw me again, asking me if I got my card straightened out from Corporate. I said no, and he told me that I would usually hear from them on a Friday. So I was hoping to get back in action. So I go to my main game - Bean Bag Toss - whoa. they changed the settings from 750 of a jackpot to 500? They raised the score up, and you only get 19 seconds instead of 22? I played, got a few jackpots, and the left IMMEDIATELY. I got to Location A an hour later, and what do you know… the jackpot got changed from 500 to 400?! Well… this was different. I had a feeling like… well, I know why they changed it. They must have tracked my history and figured it out, and did that to those two locations. 

Then comes the day of infamy - Friday, October 4. I get a call and they tell me, “We want you not to come to our facilities anymore”. We get into a long chat about why and such. It was 15 minutes each session. But nonetheless, I was literally devastated.

There were some things which should NOT have come out of their mouths. Yes, I got the Switches, but did it matter what I did with them? They claim that the arcade is a “place to have fun and not just for people to get prizes and sell them”. Well to be honest what right do you have to ban people because they win prizes? As a paying customer I should have been respected to win the prizes. I could have respected just the lowering of the jackpots on the games and all but the outright ban? That said something. I did not tamper with any of the machines or games to win the tickets, nor did I ‘exploit’ the system. That’s not something I do. There was an error on the system which was given light to the managers - not just by me - but by my friend - MONTHS beforehand, and nothing was done. That’s their fault, and their card company.

The card company supposedly did this investigation while my card is locked, yet why did the employee at Location C tell me that I still have 63,000 tickets left on the card on September 26? It did not make sense at all. 

I was told that they were “not going to press charges”.... come again? First off, charges of what? Fraud? If they even thought of that, they would have a massive lawsuit on their hands. It took them months to fix an already disorganized system, and all of a sudden they “suspected fraudulent activity”? If their card system was fixed in JUNE this would not have happened.

This next one infuriated me. They told me they were not going to tell the other places that I “abused their system”. First off, I don’t think they don’t have a right to. If they did, I hope the others blow them off. I had only focused on their arcades because it was fun to me and that I could win there. I guess after their decision I guess I never have to see a certain area again.

Lastly, their “Zero Tolerance” Policy is poppycock. Yeah, sure, I know what they really have a zero tolerance for… people who can win a lot of tickets. It was clear on their mind when they talked about ‘their arcade is for fun and not for selling stuff’, and seeing when I saw the jackpots lowered on October 3. I know what their “zero tolerance” REALLY is for. 

What I believe is that this was a discriminatory practice done by this place, and since they made their decision, I will make my own. I will be making charge-backs for ALL of the money I have spent from July until September. If I can’t use the unused credits I have, I want ALL of my money back. Plain and simple. I may also pull forward into telling other people about this place and such, which will be told on all of my social media networks. I have zero tolerance for persecuting what I do with my tickets. I do not heed to predatory actions like that. I know I will not head to their locations again (and will start referring that NO ONE goes there anymore).

One of my charge-backs was denied. I still have not got any of my money back yet. I feel like they may also have cancelled the ordering of the Nintendo Switch which I redeemed for at Location B on September 19. I am pondering my next course of action. What should I do since I feel they probably cancelled my prize redemption, and that my charge-backs were denied? Am I still entitled to the prize? Should I take action against this company?",legaladvice,t3_dk0df7

I honestly have no idea what the flair for my post would be, but my father is a douche and that is what led to this. 

A few years ago, my father cheated on my mother with her best friend(she was also my best friends mother) and left us. He stopped paying bills and stopped supporting us for about a year and a half. He then wanted to start a relationship with us but we refused because he hasn’t even apologized about what happened(to this day) and occasionally says good morning or something dumb like that. My mom has been having a ton of trouble with bills lately and wants to take him to court for child support. My father is a douche(refer to flair) and I don’t want a relationship with him(neither does my twin sister). We are both 15, turning 16 in February, and I’m afraid if we take him to court and he can request we start spending time with him. I’d like to think our opinion in this matters but I know that depends on the judge. If we do take him to court for child support, CAN he request that we start spending time with him or is it just he pays and we don’t have to speak to him.

"Received a ticket for failure to stop at a stop sign. Though I did come to a complete stop, I'm not sure if I may have made some other mistake though. Hoboken, NJ (39:4–144)I was stopped at a stop sign at a 4 way, looking at my phone for navigation. GPS had me turning left, but the dot was in the middle of the block so I couldn't tell if it was that left or the next. I decided I should turn here, and began to move forward. Then I saw a cop car coming from the right, and briefly tapped my brake thinking I would stop and let them go first, but immediately thinking better of stopping in the crosswalk/intersection, I continued on. When I was already about halfway across, the cop car also pulled into the intersection, approaching the side of my car. Neither one of us were going very fast and they stopped several feet away, so no injury/damage.

But, they ended up, pulling me over, and gave me a ticket for failure to stop at a stop sign. I was for sure stopped for several seconds while checking navigation, but I think they may have seen the quick brake tap as a half-assed stop, not realizing that I had already stopped before that. I'm not sure why they entered the intersection when I was already crossing though. So I'm going to go to court and plead my case, knowing that I may very well lose in a ""your word against mine"" situation, but I have to at least try.

Questions:

1. Did I break any laws by checking my phone while the car was stopped? (It was on the center console, and I was just looking at it, trying to match road names with street signs, not doing anything else)?
2. Did I break any laws by tapping the brake while entering the intersection?

I want to point these out as explanations of what happened, but I don't want to accidentally end up creating any additional issues for myself. Any other insight/experience into how to plead this case would also be appreciated.

Anytime I've contacted attorneys and share my story, they tell me I don't have enough evidence or that they simply don't want to touch my case.

Long story short, I believe I have been wrongfully arrested, wrongfully terminated, and have proof of administrative negligence from the courts, clerks, and other agencies in several instances involving this case.

I recently received a copy of a document from the courts I requested months ago which they didn't send and months after taking hours out of my day to contact the clerks and get a hold of the document, I believe they have sent me a forged document to make it seem as if they sent it months ago.

To be more specific, the document has a fresh seal on it with a date from several months ago. Why would it be fresh ink, but backdated to several months ago? It surely wasn't the original as they said they claimed they sent it out months ago but I never received. So something is clearly off about it being back dated but with fresh ink.

So...who to contact? What to do? How much could I expect it to cost? Considering the circumstances would any attorney take the case pro bono or on a contingency basis? I believe this has left me unemployed since 2016 so there are definitely damages that can potentially be recovered.

Well now it’s more than a month into the trip, the sublet kept delaying the date, has not moved in, not paid a cent, is in another state, and now won’t move in at all or pay (honestly not sure she can). She will come back to this state eventually though. 

The wrinkle is I only have texts, and her actual tour of the apartment where I verbally told her the rent numbers, when I’d be leaving, her saying she’d be staying until the end etc. as proof of our contract. The other wrinkle is she’s in my agency, it may reflect negatively on me to go to war with someone in the contracting agency that I sometimes have to interact with. 

On September 27 she delayed until October 15. On October 9th she said she wouldn’t come until a week after October 27. On October 15th she said she pay for the 15-31 in two days and the 31st would be her “last day.” I asked her what she meant by last day and she took two days to reply. Now she’s saying she doesn’t have the funds for even 15-31.

I think it’s fair to ask her for at least one month rent to settle this matter. I don’t want to think about while I’m in this other country working, but I also don’t want to let it go.",legaladvice,t3_dkekmj
"Unauthorized dumping of water in Texas.A large oil/petroleum series of storage tank is pumping a huge volume of water 3 miles to dump it onto my family pasture (10s of millions of gallons).

"Does a $550 fine for ‘failure to leave a licensed premises’ count as a criminal conviction or offence? In other words, would I have to declare this when applying for my second year working holiday visa?I was charged for failure to leave a licensed premises in February. I challenged it, because the police officers were wrong, I was told I could come back to the festival in an hour and they’d let me in, but he police saw me walking around and just assumed I’d been removed from the premises, thus fining me. They only just got back to me a couple of weeks ago saying the fine still stands, completely bullshit, but whatever. I’ve not paid it off yet but I have applied for my second year visa in the meantime and it’s taking longer than expected, and I’m now worried that maybe it’s because I answered ‘no’ to never being charged with an offence or a criminal conviction.

"Should I report the owners daughter? Is this considered a hostile work environment and am I a victim of retaliation?&amp;#x200B;

I was recently moved from salary-exempt to hourly at my full-time job. I was told I would receive the equivalent of my annual salary if I worked 40 hours a week; however, there is a discrepancy with that I am literally just not smart enough to figure out. (Will go into further detail later) 

I live in TN which is a right to work state, so I am aware that they can let me go. I believe I am about to be let go or fired from my current job, so much so that I am having obsessive thoughts and am very stressed out about it, enough to make this post to occupy my time until I can call the FLSA on Monday.

\- Moving On Up

I've worked there for a year, and when I started, I was a part-time salesmen, then moved to the back as a full-time employee. At this time my responsibilities were that of a stockman/warehouse employee, and I took it upon myself to do social media during a time our marketing person was preoccupied with other responsibilities. Although I was encouraged to clock in when I did anything for social media, I never considered it part of my job description. Just before an event being held during the weekend (after my 40 hours), I was moved to a salary position. I worked like this for approximately 8 months. 

\- Broken Promises

During this time, the operations manager came in to my workspace and said, ""You're pretty much our inventory manager."" Eventually I was told by the owner of the company we would soon expand and afterwards I would train my replacement and be promoted to marketing. After expanding into the new warehouse, another employee was promoted to my same position. It was never explicitly stated that I would be training him, but that he was to shadow me. Although, I was showing up early and doing what I considered 'above and beyond', keeping up with their social media, the new employee was abusing his salary position, to the point that the operations manager even states to me, ""If the new employee keeps this up, we're going to move him to hourly.""

\- Poor Communication &amp; Mistrust

During a delivery, my associate received a call while I was driving. I didn't know this at the time but it was our supervisor asking if the both of us would work that coming Saturday, outside of our schedule. I am never asked, and I only hear my associate decline. Upon returning to the warehouse, our supervisor says, ""Forget about the weekend thing, but we've been thinking about moving you guys from salary to hourly."" Over the weekend, I receive an invitation from the owner's daughter, whom at the time I believed to be HR, to download a scheduling app with no explanation. I call would-be HR and asked if I could schedule a meeting for the following Monday morning, but was then informed that she is no longer HR and that our operations manager is now also HR. She did agree, however, to still be present for the meeting. I got the operations manager and my direct supervisor to agree as well. Only after contacting my operations manager was I told about the change in my pay from salary to hourly. He said that my pay rate would stay the same and that I had only worked, verbatim, ""38-ish hours"" the previous week. I do not believe this approximation is accurate. 

\- First Meeting

Trying to be sensitive to us having paid meetings, I created an itinerary, and a copy can be provided if needed, but it included an me for a raise, questions about what was going on, why, etc. I genuinely wanted to open a dialogue between all of my supervisors and myself. The meeting was professional and friendly, however, unproductive. During the meeting, it was established:  
 \- How I was being paid did not change because of a demotion  
 \- May have been because of an associate's work habit but I would be the only one to benefit because I generally like to come in early  
 \- I was told there would be no restrictions on when I could clock in.  
 \- They explained why I did not currently qualify for a salary position, which I understand, although I feel I am understandably upset about what happened and how it was carried out.

\- Confusion &amp; Compromise

I do not know if it's relevant, but after the switch we were encouraged to cut corners on things they previously praised our diligence on, such as stocking the inventory we dropped off. These were not the only changes. At some point, the operations manager and the owner's daughter come into the room with me, my associate, and my then supervisor (owner's son) and informs us that the owner's daughter will be helping my supervisor 'use his time more efficiently' and that our finance person would be helping out in the warehouse (price tagging, picking orders, etc.). I am correct in my assumption that she is there to review how my associate and I operate, but I have no problem with this because I am proud of the way I conduct myself.   
 About 2 weeks ago, I was asked by the owner if I would be interested in some overtime, taking some on-location video and photography for the stores over the weekend, to which I agreed. Perhaps I should've mentioned this earlier, but I had already been acquiring overtime, coming in early/staying late. 

Once on location, the scheduling app notified me that I could now only clock in 30 minutes prior to a scheduled shift. I sent a message to Operations/HR this time that ""it was a shame that I could only clock in 30 minutes before a scheduled shift,"" told them my terms if they wanted to hire me as a private contractor, and asked how they wanted to proceed, but did not receive a reply. Not wanting to disappoint the owner, I still carried out the work. I created an invoice with a very competitive price, because I didn't feel right charging them without first negotiating.   
  Upon returning to work the following week, they paid the invoice I had drawn up, work goes along as usual. On a delivery, I receive a series of emails from the scheduling app that the hours I worked for the previous week had been corrected. While on the road, I call my operations manager, but to my surprise am greeted by the owner's daughter. I'm still not sure what her explanation meant, something to do with our pay period being split up into two weeks and one week, although i've always been paid on the 1st and the 15th. I am afraid to ask for clarification because during this conversation I was snapped at. The next day I am informed by the financial person/warehouse helper that she is now my supervisor (though I respect and like this person, she has little warehouse experience, and I have had to delegate tasks to her), and that they've noticed I'm 'upset' or 'agitated' with the change and if I could come up with a compromise. I told her that I'd like a promotion to work towards, I had some ideas of what that may look like, and that I could write them down, to which she said that'd be a great idea. I spent the following night drafting a job description to be the basis for a discussion, and subject to negotiation.

\- Ambush Meeting!

The next day, my new supervisor asks if I've made something to show her, and I email her my draft. After a short time, she returns and informs me the owner's daughter is on her way and wants to have a meeting. Upon entering the room, the owner's daughter raises her voice in what I believe to be a hostile way. The first time she raised her voice, it was in response to me making this proposition that I was more or less asked to do by my direct supervisor. Without me instigating, the owner's daughter brought up the phone conversation in which I asked about how my schedule was changing. I felt like I was being baited into quitting my job by remarks like, ""Why would you work at a company that you do not trust?"" and ""Why do you want to work here?"" I was responded to with baiting and hostility when expressing that I want to trust them. Initially I was told this was not a demotion, but now was being told it did qualify because they were taking away 'social media responsibilities', but as I stated above, to me, that was never part of my job description. At the beginning of the meeting, she implied that there would not be a promotion available to me ever, and later implied something different, but I still believe her initial response to be both the truth and baiting me to quit. She tried to discipline me on my “attitude”, though I believe a more apt description of my behavior is “visibly upset”. If it had really been a problem, I should have received a formal warning of some kind but never did. When I asked to be provided with an example of my attitude, the only example she could give seemed to be only of her opinion, happened weeks prior, and was never addressed until that moment.

\- 'Tis the Season

I'm scared. I’m incredibly stressed out. I don't know who to speak to. Would it be smart to make a formal complaint to my supervisor about the owner's daughter? I really want to look into stress/medical leave for fear that I will be let go.

He plans to record his findings within a published article online somewhere. He would include drug name, reagents used, and include images of the test results. He will not be giving the name of the site, or the seller.   I understand the motive behind this, and I do think it could spread awareness to people who lack trust in federal warnings about this topic.

She went for a casual walk on the beach this morning and came across [this insane turtle skull](https://imgur.com/a/dvqSOOQ). Obviously she's pretty stoked about this, but is worried about taking it back to her home state through airport security. She wants to donate it to our school, but we both figure that trying to take a skull ~~of such endangered animals~~ is probably begging to be questioned by the TSA. We were both totally unable to find anything through google searches that applied to this specific situation, though. Everything we saw that was remotely relevant only applied to either live sea turtles or already dead sea shells. We both know it would be hard to prove she didn't get it on the black market or poachers, but would they give the dictionary definition of a nuclear family the benefit of the doubt in that scenario? ~~They're extremely endangered~~, so do special restrictions apply to them even if they died of natural causes?

"Arrested because of a Clerical errorIn 2011, a friend received a speeding ticket.  There was a family emergency the day of court, and my friend missed their court date. A warrant was issued, but everything was resolved without incident the following day and the warrant was lifted.

Now, a few weeks ago, my friend is pulled over and told that there is a warrant out for their arrest for the speeding ticket that was resolved in 2011.  They were handcuffed, processed, and spent half the day in jail.  Upon posting bail, they went to court the following day. They demonstrated that everything was paid, and the courts admitted it was a clerical error and profusely apologized.

However, the court of public opinion doesn’t forget. My friend is well regarded in the community, and now this is a blemish on their outstanding record. 

One item that is troubling to me is that my friend has had multiple background checks in the years following 2011 for work and never once did this appear. They’ve also been pulled over in the years since with no issue. While the courts acknowledge they were wrong, there is no reason as to why it happened now.

"New dog in condo building bite mine - Philadelphia, PAI own a condo in a 12 unit apartment building and I’d say it’s probably %75 owner occupied. I have lived in this building for 2 years now and we do have a private management company/HOA and board.

My dog is a 11 year old lab mix, very goofy but extremely well behaved...large, but pretty old/can’t jump up/etc. I keep him leashed at all times in the building and on the property like in our gated lot. 

Recently, a boyfriend of one of the units (a woman who’s living in her parent’s owned condo) brought a dog into the picture. Very obvious pit mix as well. The
dog is simply out of control. The first time our dogs met it was in the gated lot and he asked if they could meet - at first I hesitated knowing my dog is not great meeting on leash (was a stray as a puppy and still has some socialization issues). I expressed my concern but he is wanted to try anyways...needless to say his dog became aggressive and lunged at mine, to which he immediately apologized and yelled at his dog. Since then, I haven’t crossed paths much thankfully while walking mine..though there have been plenty of times I have been coming or going from the apartment and he’s had it off leash on property. The dog is huge, jumps, it’s just not appropriate. 

This past week I had left for a business trip while my fiancé, who’s cared for my dog for almost 5 years now, took over dog duties. That same night I leave, she takes the dog out for the last walk of the day and runs into the tenant, her boyfriend, and the dog. My fiancé was friendly but kept her distance while the tenant tried to coax the dogs to say hi. Immediately the other dog lunged at mine, scared it so much he popped out of his collar and almost bolted. The woman laughed about it and said “there’s no blood, it’s fine” while the boyfriend yet again apologized for his dog.

The following afternoon, my dog walker took out my dog during the afternoon. As he was exiting the gated lot, the woman was coming in with the dog. My walker said the other dog got loose and bolted to mine and attacked it. He was able to get the dog off mine, but was extremely shaken by the incident and called me immediately after. My dog only suffered minor bite marks..but enough where we were concerned if he needed stitches. My fiancé left work to go home and make sure everything was ok..determined he was good for the night after speaking with the vet and planned to take him in first thing in the morning to get evaluated.

Knowing this could be extremely delicate of a situation - I emailed the tenant with pictures explaining the situation, that it was already reported to the management company and our board, and that I will be taking my dog to the vet. I kept it as factual as possible, really being conscientious not to appear emotional/etc even though I so badly wanted to tear into her. Of course 24 hours later, she emailed back at first a bit combative saying dogs just being dogs and it was friendly fire but towards the end, claims fault and offers to pay the vet bill.

Fast forward the next morning - my dog receives a ~$300 vet visit including rabies shots, etc. puncture wounds all cleaned up..it honestly looks a lot worse than it is..but he’s on antiobiotics, pain meds, and eating and sleeping normally according to my fiancé.

The positive thing about this situation is that the building is small, and my Fiancé is actually on the board. The president loves us and my dog, including everyone else in the building as he’s literally just a sweet old man dog and is very well behaved, doesn’t bark, etc.

My question is, where do I go from here? We’re making internal moves to report everything to our board and management company as well as the we are having an owner’s meeting this week (that she for sure won’t be at bc she never has come to any). I have never been in this situation before and want to make sure I am taking all necessary steps to further protect my dog and my family from these people and their dog.

Thank you in advance!

We divorced several years ago but we have kids together and have joint custody where we kinda decide when we want the kids. I want to amend this custody order and cut contact with her. 

Every single day she calls me and starts screaming at me, calling me a piece of shit. She texts me and verbally abuses me every single day. I tell her to leave me alone and block her number. She downloads a texting app and keeps texting me there, by passing her blocking.  I've changed my phone number but she just takes the kids phone and steals it from them. 

She takes the kids phone who are both 14 years old and then calls me and harasses me from their phone numbers. I cant block my kids. She will pretend to be my kids and say very hurtful things to me but I know it's her. She refuses to leave me alone and be a normal person. 

I've been disabled for a couple years and recently got a job and now she says shes taking the kids away from me because I'll be at work and never see them. I've repeatedly told her to stop contacting me, I'm amending our custody order and I can communicate with my kids without her. 

She messages me from about 5 different numbers a day. Calls me upwards of 30 times in a row, insults me through text messages. I finally told her that if she does not stop, I will file harassment charges on her.

"I bought a stolen item online and the police officer on the case stopped respondingBackstory...in June I purchase a Mac for a great deal online via OfferUp and it was shipped to me. After wiping the Mac, Mac OS warned me it still had admin controls installed and that it was to a school district in California. With me living in a other state (Arizona to be infact) I called them up and asked them to remove the admin controls. The next day a police officer calls me and informs me by great deal was actually stolen from the school.

After giving him details of the return address, the OfferUp listing and images of the item he informs me that he would contact me in about a week or so to figure out how to fairly return the item since I would lose money by having to ship it.

"My girlfriend's family is trying to take her house given to her awayOkay lotta backstory here. So I'm (22m) and my girlfriend is 19. I'm in the United States (don't wanna post state if I don't have to) We met two years ago and it's been amazing ever since then. I was in college far from the same hometown we grew up in and met at when we did start dating but I moved home after a hard year that left me worn. Moving forward tho I started a business that did incredible and we don't see it slowing down but instead picking up. And that's all that is really bad about our hometown. so we decided this year we'd stay and work on the business. 

Well I have been at my parents big farm house with me and my girlfriend for a year. She used to live at the home she grew up in. She has a broken family that I have to explain for this story. Her mom had two marriages. The first one wasn't my girls dad. So my girl has three half siblings that are 22, 24, and 25. Then she has a whole sibling who's 12. Her mom and dad are divorced. Her mom and also her sister who's 22, and little brother live at the house that my girl grew up in with her dad and mom. I thought when her dad and mom split around ten years ago he left the house to her mom. That's what they all said to me. Well I saw the taxes notice because it was late for over two years😑 and the deed says to my girlfriend and her little brother. So I went and showed that to my girl and she didn't know that the house was hers. We talked with her dad and he said ""yeah I set it up so you and your brother would have a place to live."" 

Ooh man this made things interesting. So now it's been like a year since we found out. Her mom has been trying to say that house was hers for a loooong time. And her mom was awful to her dad in the divorce. He hates her. So that house wasn't meant for her. And Reddit they've been awful to this house and land. It's just a flop house for them. And her sister who's 22 has been buying furniture and talking about her plans for the house. Me and my girl have been discussing when we should drop the bomb and tell them they can't live there and what's the legal process/ grounds we have? We want to offer the little brother he can live with us and we take care of him. His mom would finally move out and be less than 200 yards down the road at her boyfriend of 20 years house. So besides telling her sister to quit being a loaf and staying rent free no one gets hurt really. But what's the legal grounds here?",legaladvice,t3_dkixhh
"Being sued for car accident after 2 years... and one dayHey guys,

Short story: I rear-ended someone the evening of October 13, 2017, and provided my contact and insurance information at the time.  I'd completely forgotten about it until a couple months ago, when I received a call from an insurance adjuster (at my insurer, Nationwide), saying that the victim had taken no action as of yet and it was likely to simply go away due to the 2-year statute of limitations in Texas.

This morning, I received a certified letter notifying me I was being sued for ""no less than $150,000.00, and no more than $1,000.000.00"" (the typo in the 2nd number is exactly what was in the filed case, so I figured I'd include it), and the victim was requesting a jury trial.  Odd thing is, though, it explicitly states the accident date of October 13, 2017, but also states the filing was accepted on October 14, 2017.

I'll be contacting my insurance company on Monday no matter what, and have numerous options for legal representation if needed, so I'm not terribly concerned... but I do have a couple nit-picking questions:

1. Can the typo stated above (""$1,000.000.00"") in any way be enforced?  If so, I'll just write the bastard a $1,000 check and call it a day.  I can be a bit pedantic... but I'm not sure if the ""no less than $150,000.00"" stipulation would supersede an obvious typographical error.
2. Given that the statute of limitations is 2 years, and they filed it 2 years and 1 day after the accident, am I generally in the clear?  Or is there an unwritten ""or the next business day"" type rule that allowed them an extra day since the 2-year mark fell on a Sunday?

Thanks in advance.

"Oil Change Ruined Engine - Contact my insurance or work with repair shop directly? [CA]I recently had my oil changes at a medium-sized, non-chain repair shop for a \~$15k \~20 year old car. They have been around at least 10 years and I have been going to them for \~4 years with no issues. 

Timeline of incident:

* I left the shop, drove home a few miles, then did some errands later that night, and about 10 miles after my oil change my car started shaking. 
* I pulled over asap, assuming it was related to the oil change. I checked the oil and the dipstick was dry, so called a friend to bring me some oil. I recorded myself checking the oil and it being low (time stamped 4 hours or so after the oil change).
* I poured \~3-4 quarts in (car takes \~5 total) and still didnt have any oil on the dipstick.
* I left it there at this point and waited for it to get brighter in the morning.
* I headed back to my car to check again in the daylight the next morning, now the dipstick was covered in oil... maybe it settled? (This worries me a bit now, since I tampered with the evidence I guess...) but I still left it there and haven't moved it.

The shop is only open on weekdays, so I was going to wait till Monday to call them, then have it towed. But, after reading about the situation, it seems like there are a few options for addressing this situation:

1. **Work with the original repair shop directly -** Ask them to cover if there are any issues, record the call, and if they offer to have their insurance cover it, I should be good. **Concerns** \- I do like the relationship with them so far, but I can't guarantee they won't be difficult. I'm not sure if they would cover a car rental, and I worry that they could tamper with an actual evaluation of the car and later say it was not their fault.
2. **Camp 2 says I should absolutely not take it to the original shop**, but instead should take it to another reputable shop, get an estimate of damages, then speak to the first shop to see if they offer to go through their own insurance. If not, then sue them in small claims and hope to win. **Concerns -** This would be safer, but I still need to rent a car on my own, pay for the inspection, etc, and worry I won't get compensated for these costs, could possibly lose in court, and sever my relationship with the shop.
3. **Work with my insurance company directly -** Contact them (AAA) immediately and have them do all the leg work. They would recommend a 3rd party to inspect it, then they would follow up with the original shop. **Concerns -** I get a car rental this way, but I imagine this will cost me my $1k deductible and I worry this might not lead anywhere. My dad had a similar issue, but his insurance was never able to prove fault and he did not get compensated for anything (which I admit could have just been due to his lack of follow up, bad insurance or something else). This would also make my relationship with the repair shop awkward.

**Is there any best way to handle a situation like this?** I have spoken to a few car people I know (1 being a mechanic), but they all give different advice. Mainly saying to just complain to the original repair shop and demand they fix it. I have a somewhat unique car and have a feeling the engine will be expensive to replace, so I want to handle this as best as possible.",legaladvice,t3_dkfpmo

"How do i get started with filing a restraining order and eventually sole custody? North Carolina.**Separation and Custody Details:**

Marine husband and I are separated since Sep 2019.
We have joint custody, I have primary. 
He pays child support per military BAH.
He has visitation- every other weekend, half the holidays, as reasonable, etc.
I live 15 mins from his work, 45 mins from his place of residence.
We are in North Carolina.
He is a recruiter. We’re 3 hours away from the closest base.

**Background Info:**

He has been psychologically torturing me the whole marriage and I’m finally tired of it. He does things like cornering me and yelling at me until I have a panic attack.

The past two years we’ve been entertaining divorce. He called the divorce off previously but it’s for real this time. I’m now realizing that during the past two years he had a pattern of screaming at me, recording it, and then threatening to have me committed. He never did, but always had his phone out as if to call. Maybe he just never had the courage to go through with it.

During these moments he’d record me and loudly say, “see how crazy she is? She is so crazy.”

In an attempt to save my marriage, I’ve been medicated and in therapy. I’m diagnosed with PTSD, schizoaffective bipolar, and BPD. My therapist and psychiatrist have both said they’d vouch for my ability to parent and be reasonable, in court. 

In total, I’ve called the police on my husband once out of fear. 3 times because he didn’t come home and I was worried  - “I’ll be home at 9pm” Doesn’t show up until 3am.

We are now separated and I thought I got out and everything will settle. He didn’t check up on the kids once and never tried to see them until last weekend.

Last weekend, he did the lack of communication again. I texted to ask what time I should expect the kids and he turned his phone off. I have a record I’ve tried calling from 9am to 9pm the day of return, on several phones. Straight to voice mail. I ended up calling the police to do a wellness check at his place though he arrived 30 mins later before the sheriff got a chance to check. 

He knows lack of communication bothers me, especially when it comes to the children so he deliberately never gives me solid times. “Might come back morning, afternoon, I don’t know” (at time of pickup) I think it’s reasonable that by 9pm after no response it’s time to make the call.

An hour later, he texts me that our son tried to grab his penis repeatedly and said “If I find out you and your boyfriend are molesting him, you’re done!” My son has NEVER done this with his brother or my boyfriend!! 

**Why I want a restraining order and eventually, sole custody:**

My ex husband gives me a lot of psychological distress. 

He’s done things like phone people and tell them in schizophrenic. He called my current boyfriend to tell him that. I yelled at him to give my phone back and he laughed, said to my boyfriend “Do you hear how crazy she is?”

The suddenly showing up after a month and a half of him not being around for the kids, and then accusing me of molestation. I called the cops. My ex then accused me of coaching my son. 

My kids also couldn’t get their story straight on what exactly they did when they hung out with their father. He has no bed so they claimed they slept on the floor, but then a bed, but then in their car seats all night. They said they did “nothing” then “people came to his house” and then when I asked who they said “no one.” They’re 6 and 4.

I want him to leave me and the kids alone. I’m honestly terrified. He has a shotgun he doesn’t lock up (I have a recording of him saying he doesn’t care if the then 3 year old got it and he allows the kids to shoot it - I have no issues with guns, I take issue with just shooting and no concept of gun safety.)

His house has no electricity and no furniture. I’m worried about what is happening to the children when they’re there. It’s in a trailer in the middle of the woods. I’m assuming there’s no water cause my ex bathes in gas stations. 

He’s also still a marine so he gets really buddy buddy with cops.

**My question:** Do I have enough to file a restraining order? What costs or issues should I be looking at? Is this something I should do through the military (they said they only work with physical assault issues not psychological so I imagine I shouldn’t bother there) or just with a civilian judge? What are the chances I can even get sole custody without physical abuse?

Thank you so much for your help!",legaladvice,t3_dkbnql
"NY Real Estate: Don't think the seller's agent submitted our full asking price offer to the sellerYesterday my bf and I decided to put an offer in on a house; by the time we sat down with our real estate agent, she told us the seller's agent told her  that another offer had been submitted just that morning. We really want the house, so we offered full asking price with an escalation of a few extra grand over asking price.

Today the seller's agent (who is also the nephew of the seller and doesn't appear to do really any other real estate) told our agent the seller accepted a verbal offer instead of ours (which was the real deal, with paperwork, deposit, ect), and the seller's agent wants us to wait until Tuesday to see if ""she [the other potential buyer?] can come up""... (come up what? In price? Is that legal?) and then he'll get back to us. Then the seller's agent ducked our realtor's calls and didn't respond to any of her texts for the rest of the day. In the paperwork of our offer, we had it written in the offer expired at midnight today. (Yesterday now, writing this at 1am.)

I don't think the seller's agent told the buyer/his uncle about the offer, because who in their right mind would turn down full asking price in writing for a verbal offer with no paperwork?

"[AZ] Obtaining Court Records for an Ongoing TrialMy friend recently started dating a girl who is currently facing Child/Vul Adult Abuse-Intent charges in Arizona. She is clearly lying to him about the nature of the trial, which became obvious after looking it up on Arizona's Public Access Case Lookup tool. (Luckily, she's dumb as fuck so it was pretty obvious that she was lying.) I have a few questions.

What would be the best method to obtain more information about the trial? Case minutes are not available on the lookup tool. Would calling the court house and requesting information result in anything? Specifically, I am interested in the outcome of a plea deal, which I believe was denied. I am also interested in the degree of the felony she is facing. 

There is a codefendant, but charges do not appear under his name in the lookup tool. Does this mean that only she is facing charges? If the title of the case is State of Arizona vs. Her Name, does this imply that she is more ""at fault"" than her codefendant? 

Does the ""intent"" in the title of the charge imply that child abuse was intended, but not committed?

"Landlord Living in Garage (Utah)I signed a six month lease for a duplex in a house. It's a house that the landlord split into two apartments, one in back and one in front. Imagine the back part of a house, that's the ""apartment"" he created, which I moved into. 

&amp;#x200B;

When we first signed the lease, I specifically asked him if he was going to live in the garage. I just got a feeling, maybe from something he said, that he would be. He at least said he'd be there a lot working on the garage, to create a new unit. From my own research, it seems that a garage isn't a legally livable space anyway, zoning laws. His response was ""oh no, I'll be fixing it up, but I'll be staying somewhere else."" something along those lines. sigh of relief, signed the lease, happy girl. Until I noticed he was staying here, like for real. He also has a van that I sometimes saw he lived in for the first few weeks, then started living in the garage more frequently. He does other things like blowing up large mountain biking tires (very loud), sawing, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've posted about this before, but now it's actually bugging me. We have a laundry room attached to the house, that goes to a door attached to our unit and not the front unit. The landlord is not only living in the garage (I see him everyday or hear his dogs barking in there) but he's also using the laundry room, on a Saturday, when he has four tenants living in the house, paying him rent. Another thing that bugs me about this is our front door is a large window-door, and the door to the detached garage is 10 feet from our front door. There's little privacy. He almost saw me in my undies yesterday when I was sick and off work. 

&amp;#x200B;

The perks are: he allows pets. He's pretty chill and fixes things for us, and he's nice. All our utilities and internet are included in our rent. Between me and my partner, we pay $400 a month each. So that's pretty awesome. He lets us smoke (cigarettes, outside on the porch) which many other tenants wouldn't allow. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of just being open and talking to him.

"Car was stolen/taken from dealership. What can I do?Location: Florida.

I dropped my car off at a dealership Tuesday morning for a problem it was having.  Thursday I got a call from the maintenance liaison describing what they found wrong, what they were going to do and that parts were being ordered. I gave them the okay for the repairs and I assume they ordered the parts. Since I own a very nice car, I have a device in my car that alerts me when the car starts and is parked, where it is, the route taken during trips, fuel efficiency, etc.  

Friday night I got a notification saying it was started. I thought it was weird since it was 7:30 p.m. and the dealership closes at 8.  Half an hour later, I get the notification that it is parked more than half an hour away from the dealership I left it at. A quick google search showed that it was a house.  I assumed it was a technician that took it home for the night because he didn't think anyone would notice it.  

I called the dealership to see why it was at a house and not the dealership; however, because it was so close to closing, I got a someone from the sales department and after not being able to find my car he said that they would be figuring it out tomorrow.  I told them that I was going to call the police and report it as stolen, as I did not give anyone at the dealership permission to take it home.  While I was getting things figured out with the police, the general manager called and tried to explain that sometimes a car needs to be taken home to diagnose it.  I explained to him that it had already been diagnosed and the last update that my liaison gave me was that they were waiting on parts.  He realized that the technician had taken it home without permission and a little less than an hour later my car had arrived back at the dealership.  

Is this theft? What type of precautions can or should I take to make sure nothing happened with my car while it was stolen by the technician?  How do I make sure that nothing goes unnoticed now that could become worse for the long term health of the car?  Do I have any real damages from the theft/unauthorized use of my car?

I won't go into the details on that because it's not relevant to our current issue.

My question is, why would we not be able to put my name on the birth certificate? They said we can have my last name listed as the child's last name, but for father, we have to leave it blank.

As a follow-up question, would this affect any FMLA time-off or state paid family leave time if I can't supply a birth certificate with my name as the father?

Any advice on this is appreciated.

"Emergency pooped in fast food restaurant parking lot [California]So I did something extremely embarrassing and I’m not sure if I’ll be in any trouble. I get the sense that I’m okay, but I just need to double check.

After a late evening out, I was driving home, very close to or even at midnight. Suddenly, I felt an urgent need to use the bathroom. More specifically, to poop. I pulled over and looked for a fast food joint that I thought would be open and have a restroom I could use. 

I found one: a fast food burger restaurant. However, the dining area was closed and the employees did not let me in.

I then ran to a 7-11 in hope that they’d let me use their restroom. I knew they’d say no, but I had to try. In the past, I’ve tried to pay the cashier $20 to let me use whatever restroom they use but they declined so I didn’t try this time.

Desperate, I looked for ANYTHING that might be open and have a restroom near me. A grocery store, a gas station, anything. I found nothing. I rushed back to my car to make it home. I’ve had moments where I’ve had to use the restroom but have always been able to hold it, with some effort. 

This was not one of those cases. With poop certainly on the way out, I scrambled for a plastic bag or container of some sort. Nothing. Finally, I made a desperate decision: I pulled down my pants and pooped right outside my car, in a [fast food burger joint] parking lot. 

I had a towel in my car and tried to clean it up from the ground very quickly but there was definitely some left. Without any toilet paper, I pulled up my pants and left hastily. 

So given that I was in such a desperate situation, a) how likely is it that I get caught? I’m sure there are cameras around. I don’t know if anyone noticed me but I have to imagine someone would’ve said something in the time between me dropping my pants and then wiping it up off the ground if they had; b) if I am caught, what do I do? and c) i doubt this will ever happen to me again for the next 20 years at least, but if I’m in a situation like this, what do I do differently?

I’ve read a past post about this and I think people mostly felt like it was silly to worry about that and no one was going to do anything except maybe laugh. I just want to know if y’all think that holds true. I’ve never so much as peed in a bush in some remote area, and I am not a public nuisance at all. I’m embarrassed and I just don’t want to get in trouble too :/",legaladvice,t3_dkgpam
"Boss is making a coworker pay for my wages when I work in the grooming van with herFirst time posting, please go easy.

So I am a bather for a dog grooming business in Texas (possibly important for tax reasons? I’m not sure) and we have a grooming salon and two mobile grooming vans. I am the bather that bounces pretty much everywhere, whether that be the salon, van #1, or van #2. 

So I won’t go into much detail but my boss is awful. However, if I became a groomer it would be worth all of the misery as I don’t make much and I drive about and hour to work and an hour back every day.

The highlight of my job is my coworker, now to be called Sam. Sam runs van #1 and that’s honestly where I get most of my hours. However, she doesn’t use me in the van as much as she needs because of one big issue:

My boss takes my hours out of her pay. 

So if I worked ten hours one day in the van, that’s eighty dollars out of Sam’s check, not from the business. If I’m in the shop, my boss pays the eight an hour, but not the van. 

We aren’t sure if this is legal or not or if there’s anything we can do about this. I don’t actually want anything to happen to my boss because she’s a family friend but if my boss won’t pay me hourly for being in the van I might never learn to groom at this rate, and I really need the money at this point.

"Landlord Security Deposit Questions (Tennesee)Background: I moved into a house with a roommate who was previously living there for 2 years and we both started a new lease with the landlord with both of our names on it. The landlord is out of state and my roommate and I have never met him the entire time we have lived there. When we notified him we are terminating our lease to move out, he came by for a preliminary inspection approximately a month before we had to move out and sent us a checklist of items that he wanted to be done. Upon moving out, we cleaned the entire house to his checklist and he scheduled a mutual move out inspection with us the last day of the lease. The landlord, however, did not come to the inspection and wanted us to facetime him instead. After the facetime inspection, he said the house looked in good condition.

A new tenant moved into the house and complained to the landlord that the carpets were dirty and the house smelt like urine and had to have the place professionally cleaned. I took many pictures and the house did not smell when we left but my roommate did have a dog. My landlord wanted us to pay for the cleaning fees (approx $500). My roommate already agreed he would pay for the entire cleaning fee since it was from him and his dog. 

I have another 10 days until it is within the 30-day window for him to return my portion of the security deposit and the landlord is starting to say we have to pay for additional damages. I looked through the TN Tenant Codes and it states after 7 days of a new tenant moving in, the landlord waives his right do charge the previous tenant for any damages. The landlord also never notified me in writing where my security deposit was located upon signing the lease but I don't know how much I can prove it was not in a separate account.

Do I have the right to retain my full security deposit because of these two provisions even though he is trying to get us to pay for additional damages 7 days after a new tenant moving in but within the 30-day window he can keep my deposit? Should I notify him of this or should I just wait to see if he missed the 30-day window to refund my deposit?",legaladvice,t3_dke9i1

"KS: Car Was Hit While Parked. The Police Officer Said Their ""System Was Down"" and I Won't Know Anything About the Drivers Insurance Until Monday. Should I Tow the Car Now or Wait?Hello,
I was visiting a friend today and an old woman hit my parked car.  The car is undrivable on the side of the road.  A police officer took down my info and the woman's info, but said that their ""system"" was down and he wouldn't be able to give me an accident report number until early this upcoming week.  Unfortunately the other driver did not have her insurance card on her.  The officer told me he would get her insurance info and call me, but it might take a couple of days.  
My car was legally parked, but when she hit it she pushed it onto the curb and about 6 inches in front of my friend's neighbors driveway.   It's not really in the way, but their neighbor isn't home so I haven't been able to explain the situation to them and I am worried they might have the car towed.  My friend is leaving for a few days, so he won't be able to talk to them either.
  
Assuming they DO have insurance (their car was registered, so they at least had insurance when they registered it), will I be able to get their insurance company to pay to tow it twice (once to my house to get it out of the way, and later to wherever I want it taken since it probably isn't salvageable)?  Will they reimburse me no matter which towing company I call?  On another note, I am out of a car right now...will their insurance company reimburse me for the uber rides I am having to pay for?  I've never been involved in an accident before, so I don't really know how any of this works.
Thanks!

"Misdiagnosis and a medical billFirst of all, I know that many people will think that my case this a not big deal ($215 bill), because it could be worse, etc. For me, it is a big expense considering other medical bills and the fact that I was growing up in the country where the insurance= full coverage. 

I've had a spine issue since I was a child. I was treated, had many medical exams. The last radiologic exam was 2 years ago and showed a few issues with my spine. Pilates exercises really helped me with the pain. After I moved to the US I was only doing exercises only from time to time. 

One day after free outdoor yoga classes I couldn't stand up from the bed. I thought this was only a sore muscle due to a break in exercises. Unfortunately, the pain wasn't gone for 2 weeks and I decided to visit the chiropractor for the first time in my life. He helped me and listed almost all diagnoses that I was sure about before. He was able to tell me what's wrong under his fingers. In addition to confirm his diagnosis, he directed me to the Radiology center. People working in chiropractic register convinced me to talking in Radiologic center that my pain is unbearable, otherwise, their exam may be not covered by the insurance. I have UnitedHealthCare insurance and the Radiology center, which I visited, is in-network. Before the examination, I wanted to make sure that it will be covered by the insurance. I gave them my card and they convinced me to do not worry because it will be covered. I didn't lie about my pain because it was real. 

I've just received a bill:  Insurance will cover only $ 30, my balance is $215. So I pay monthly for UnitedHealthcare insurance and their coverage is even less than a half?  Is this is normal? I know I have to call them but first I wanted to get some advice here. 

The second thing is I got an incorrect and not full diagnosis regarding my health. In the exam description, it is written that I almost don't have problems. I know what is true and my pain is real. The previous radiologic exam from my country showed a number of diagnoses and I'm able to prove it because I've got those reports. The chiropractor was able to confirm my issues just under his fingers, but the expensive and professional medical equipment wasn't able to do that... What should I think? Isn't that ridiculous? 

 So I feel like I've been charged for the examination just because, in their opinion, I don't have severe issues.  I started to read more about this and discover that misdiagnosis is a fraud. I don't want to pay this bill I feel I've been cheated. What to do?",legaladvice,t3_dkdsi4

Although it has been a year since we were last together, she initiated not one, but two relationships with me.

These repairs were included in both the writing of the lease and in verbal communication between myself, landlord, landlords boyfriend (repairman) and my wife.  

The items included:  

A skirt around the trailer, this reduces heating and air conditioning costs.  Comparing our electric use to those of our immediate neighbors we are paying approx $100 more per month to heat during the 
winter and cool all summer.

A completely broken and unusable bathtub that has leaked below itself and rotted the floor.

Rotten cabinets in EVERY room,  seriously we have zero cabinet space cause not on cabinet in the entire house is usable.

Broken water heater:  my mother in law fixed this herself and we were “allowed” to deduct the cost from our deposit.

Leaking water pipes:  after two separate “handymen” came out to fix this and failed (we were having to turn our water off at the street cause we got a $200 plus water bill) my mother in law found and fixed the problem.

Electrical “problems”:  half of our electric outlets can not be used because as soon as one is used the breakers start to trip.  The following lists outlets that we have vs outlets we can use.

Kitchen:  3 have / 1 use
Living room: 4 have / 2 use
Children’s room: 2 have / 1 use
Main bedroom: 4 have / 3 use

The electric problems and the cabinets have had estimates done by professionals but no work has been done because the landlord stated that they cost too much.

The landlords exact words when we were discussing moving in were as follows:  “I’m going to use the money you give me each month for rent to make the repairs bit by bit”. Since then she has collected $5000 and has made no additional repairs.

TL:DR:  Landlord promised repairs in writing and has failed to do so for over 10 months.",legaladvice,t3_dk7r6q

He then starts talking about how he knows gang members and wouldn't hesitate to hire them because killing a person is cheap these days. At first I was shocked and then thought I need to record this conversation. I did not ask for his permission to record and he went on about how he would bring harm onto me if I keep making mistakes.

"“Stole $1,070” from the navy: entrapment. FLMy little brother worked at a coffee shop in a Navy base in Florida. He had been working there for about 4 months. During that time he received cash tips occasionally (as people tend to do at a coffee shop). Nobody said a word about it until yesterday when his manager told him that they are not supposed to accept tips and that any tips collected is technically “their money”, and he had to pay back $1,070.00 or face a felony for stealing from the US Navy. He immediately quit.

"My *foreign* boyfriend's dad asked me replace his water-damaged US bills at a US bank. Can I do this?Hi fellow redditors, I'm in a pickle.

My boyfriend is from Macedonia and his father had around $13,000 in a box in his basement that got flooded and the money is now damaged. Sometime recently my boyfriend's father asked me to bring this money to the US to be replaced and bring it back. He told me that damaged currency (at least US dollars) can only be replaced in the country of origin, i.e. USA (and my research thus far confirms it). Is this legal for me to do?

Couple things I'm aware of:- I can only bring up to $10,000 in cash to the states without declaring it, so the full amount I would have to declare (if declaring it would cause any issues, I could in theory travel twice to bring the money in)- The father claims that the currency is damaged but not mutilated so, based on my research, this should be replaceable at any bank.

Is it legal for me to do this for him? My main concern is that I am not the actual owner of the money. Do I need some type of notarized letter from him that gives me permission to do this?

**EDIT based on comments:**

I'm aware that many details about this might seem suspicious, I am 99% not going to do this, but I want to be educated on the situation. I want to be aware of all potential avenues this can lead to so that I can explain to my boyfriend and his father why this cannot be done this way.

I would like to know if we assume that 1) both my boyfriend and his father cannot travel to US, 2) money is perfectly legal and 3) I bring in less than 10,000$, am I legally allowed to exchange that money even though it's not mine?

Also I am a citizen of Macedonia too, not US (I just have a work visa here).

**EDIT 2:**

Also, are there options for him to exchange the money somehow without coming to US?  


**EDIT 3 (as per comments asking to elaborate more on the origins of the money and why my boyfriend can't do this):**

Traveling to US in general is very difficult, especially if you're not from a rich country. Getting a visa to the US is quite hard (and an expensive risk) for a citizen of a country like Macedonia. Affording the flight is \~2 months worth of salary. I happen to have the fortune of having a good job in the states and travel documents but most people can only usually dream of coming to US. I know my boyfriend and family for decades now (we grew up in the same neighborhood). The reason they have dollars is because this entire region was historically notorious for inflation and the money has been lying in a basement for a decade (hence how it got damaged). His dad also doesn't trust banks in Macedonia (he grew up anti-communist in a communist system, there's a lot of history to this sentiment).  


Just to explain my point here again, I do not plan on doing this at this time (it sounds like there are better ways). However, I would like to be properly educated on this to be able to communicate with my boyfriend and his father on the proper steps to take.

"Life deed and ""landlord"" [Virginia]To start: my grandfather passed away, and as a result, my grandmother sold our family farm to his brother under a life deed.

A year later, I was invited to move in. I was in a rough place, my grandmother needed help around the house, etc. I do not know if J (the brother) was told beforehand or not, I assume so. However, I do know he found out soon, everything went fine.

I have now lived here for two years in March. He has spoken to me on this property and on the phone, knowing I live here. He has increasingly changed rules about the property, and I have abided them as I could and money allowed. No damage to the house, etc.; just ordering big things sometimes takes a lot of money, so I had to save. I am working on getting disability, so I do not have a lot of income.

Recently, he has taken to showing up unannounced, and complaining about random stuff around the farm - stuff that was fine before. He has taken to threatening me with legal action, calling the law, so forth, and told me this Friday I had to be out by Monday. He states because I am not on a lease, he doesn't have to give me thirty days.

Is this accurate? Given it is a life deed, does he even have say of me staying here to help my grandmother? Is he allowed to show up unannounced if it is a life deed?

I have offered to buy the farm from him, as it was originally to go to me anyway, etc. and no luck. I'm unsure what to do now, but my health isn't the greatest and this constant stuff is wearing me down.

UPDATE:  I have confirmed it is a life estate deed (found records online; my  grandmother is older, and has the beginning of dementia, so taking her  word for it is sometimes not advised).I am going to a lawyer on Monday.

Is  there anything I can do about him calling the law, etc.? I've been told  he's threatened to have the home condemned (there is NOTHING wrong with  it, so I have no idea how this would work), kick my grandmother out,  call social services, etc. He is angry about my service dog and service  dog in training being inside.

-	she recently started having trouble getting out due to the gravel as well as the neighbors garbage bins which are close to the driveway
-	we’ve asked them to move the trash bins farther from the driveway which they have but only for 2 weeks or so

"Work contract/Lease contract with shady termination clause.I am in desperate need of help reddit. My mother not too long ago (on the April of this year) signed what she believed to be an employment contract to work in a hairdressing salon as a cosmetologist while she is in school as a way to gain experience and apply what she has learned, and then eventually begin working full-time once she got her license.

Her Employer (we'll call her Sarah) was very welcoming in the beginning and told her she'll be working with a 40/60 split of commission where as 40% is my mother's pay and 60% is Sarah's. English not being my mother's first language and her being too trusty, she signed without carefully reading the agreement. The contract is for 4 years.

She's been working in Sarah's Salon on her off days from class alongside another employee (let's call her Jane). Sarah explains to my mother that all appointment customers belong to Jane or Sarah herself, and she can only take care of walk-in customers, also part of her responsibilities include cleaning up the place before leaving the salon.

Based on what my mother has described, she's working as a janitor without barely any walk-in customers, and Jane asserts that nearly all customers are 'appointments'. She wanted to end her contract, and after asking Sarah countless times for the copy of her contract, she finally was able to take pictures of Sarah's phone that had pictures of the contract.

There's an early termination clause which reads that my mother would be responsible to reimburse Sarah for $6,400 per the 80 hour training she received at a cost of $80. My mother has received a total of 3 to 4 hours of explanation of how things work there, and she is receiving her cosmetology training in her own school. In the past months, my mother have made a total of $400 from her commission and tips. I currently live with her as living with her was far cheaper than college dorms for me.

In this 'Lease' contract, there's a lot of grammar issues, inconsistencies and other deceptive and manipulative clauses that makes no sense so I am asking for your advice.

"Porch pirates keep stealing thousands of dollars.(Florida)So as the title implies I have a very reoccurring problem with porch pirates. I live in a very small town with little in the way of stores for shopping, so I tend to order things online. I work a job at night so I'm pretty much always home during the day when most of my packages come albeit sleeping or doing yardwork in my backyard. So usually the delivery guy puts my package on the porch and it only sits there for couple hours at most. Because this happens so frequently I did invest in a camera over my door which sends me alerts when it catches movement so whenever it goes off I am either greeted by the mailman with my packages or a random person who also has my packages. If it's the latter it almost always devolves into me chasing them around the block for a while yelling at them to give me my packages back in my gator print boxers in classic Florida man fashion,  getting my packages back by them dropping them or me catching up to them and then walking back home. I'm not a very fit person so having to do this almost 2-3 times a month is exhausting and it seems like my house has more pirates than south Africa.

Fast-forward to today, I call the original creditor to inquire about one of the charges in the list of what I owed provided by the debt collector. The apartment complex tells me that they changed property management companies last month, and that **they have nothing on file about me breaking a lease or owing money.** At this point I don't know if I should contact the debt collector, try to verify or dispute the debt, or contact the property management company.

This larger “parent company” also books jobs for our smaller “agent” company that might be within our local range or just outside of it. 

So this means that sometimes I am either completing a job that was booked by the smaller “agent” company, or by our larger “parent” company. Most of the time, I am completing a job for the smaller “agent”, as I do not have a certification to transport household goods for the larger “parent” company.

Here is where the problem begins,

When I look at my paycheck, which is always signed and payed by the smaller “agent” company, my hours can be split into two categories, one as hours for the smaller company, and one as hours for the larger company. This results in me sometimes losing a significant amount of overtime sometimes, and my fellow coworkers have noticed the same thing. It is also sometimes unclear whether the job we are working on is for the smaller or larger company. Collectively, we are all also suspicious that sometimes are employer “moves hours around” so that they don’t have to pay as much overtime.

I hope this is clear enough to make any sense.

"Questions regarding salaried employment in MichiganMy husband is a manager of small shop that's part of a much larger company (company has thousands of employees). He had 3 employees under him, but they have all since quit and the company is having trouble replacing them. (They quit back in June or July.) The location is supposed to have around 6-7 employees.

As a result, my husband is working 60-80 hours a week, 7 days a week with no coverage for lunch or breaks.

Originally he was hourly and getting overtime with a small quarterly bonus (~10% of his earnings every 3 months). But after his first paycheck the company made him salary instead, with a small raise (~4%). They also raised his quarterly bonus a bit (~16% of his earnings every 3 months). He makes just a bit over the minimum wage for salaried employees in Michigan without the bonuses.

The quarter came and went last month without a bonus. He's also had to cancel all his future time off because he's the only one working there.

Is there a limit to the number of hours a salaried employee is required to work?

How long can a company hold a bonus before playing it out? He's asked them about getting his bonus for weeks, and the only answer is that they are looking into it.

Can you be salaried and still receive overtime?

How long can a company work a salaried employee before giving them time off?

From what I've been able to research, it doesn't look like the company has to pay him the bonus, can work him as many hours as they want, doesn't need to give him time off, and doesn't have to pay him overtime. 

I just want to make sure my assumptions are correct. He's been in contact with the company's HR to get this resolved, but is also looking for new employment if it's not.",legaladvice,t3_dkbxij

"Should a company compensate me for using my photo in a “shoppable” Instagram post?I’m an amateur photographer and I found out a clothing company is using my photograph as a shoppable Instagram post. The company reposted the photograph from the person in the photo (who does not own the copyright) and did leave my photo credit in the caption. I have looked into DMCA take downs. However, I feel like their use of the photo as a shoppable post turns it into an advertisement and I should receive compensation for that. 

They may have asked the person in the photograph if they can repost - I’m not sure if they did or not - but either way, that person does not own the copyright to the photo. 

I am planning on sending the company an email requesting them to compensate me for my photograph. If I request the company to compensate me and they decline to pay me but they remove the photograph from their social media, would I still be able to pursue compensation for the time period it was online?

"Divorce questions regarding division of student loan debtMy spouse and I are going to do an uncontested divorce as we are both on the same page and agree on how everything should be split. That only thing I am concerned about is their student loan debt (~$60k) will I be possibly responsible for any of it? We will be getting divorced in a community property state, she started before we were married but the majority of the debt was incurred during marriage. It is all federal loans and my name isn't on any of it.

The main concern I have is doing an uncontested divorce and having a lawyer (free military) look over everything and file for us, is that the judge may deem her debt to be more significant than mine and try to saddle me with some of it. We have kept our finances fairly separate, especially over the past couple years. We are on the same page with each of us keeping our own stuff (car, retirement, property) and I don't think that will be an issue in the eyes of the judge, the only thing I'm worried about is the student loan debt.

"BAD salon trip and they refuse a refundHi .... browsed this thread but never posted until posted until now. 
I went to a popular salon in my area to get a balayage (similar to an ombré but more natural looking) that is KNOWN and they Claim to be experts in. Spent hours in the chair only to leave with VERY brassy hair, uneven highlights and coloring I didn’t ask for. Like it looks NOTHING like what I asked for. It was terrible. Think 2000’s Christina Aguilera blonde and black highlights bad. Oh, and the stylist in the middle of my service left to get her extensions put in by another stylist. Salon offered for me to come in again to fix the issue and came out of the chair even worse. My hair is now this terrible, uneven color with uneven highlights and nothing that I asked for. The owner and manager are now essentially bullying me to accept it how it is and that I don’t deserve a refund. Also the stylist is lying and saying my hair was box dyed recently (which it had not been) 

My question is this... what can I do to get my full refund? Can I make a claim against them with BBB? Anyone else have any similar experiences? Or what else can I do?

"Is it against the law to ""distract from the pledge""?I'm a highschool student in the US (Alabama) here wondering if its really against the law to distract others from the pledge. Let me say in advance that I know my first amendment rights as far as being able to protest the pledge in school.

Friday morning I left class to get my laptop charger 5 minutes before the bell rang. The bell rang while I was walking back down the hallway that my classroom is in, which promptly started the pledge of allegiance. I kept walking because I didn't want to be too late since we were doing something important, and i was only about 5 or 6 feet away from my classroom. Its really important to note that this hallway was nearly empty: there was one girl a ways ahead of me and two teachers at the very end of the hallway. One of those teachers yelled at me to stop walking. I ignored her and kept walking, which I was right in front of my classroom now. She yelled at me again and I stopped and said ""you can't make me"". In the middle of saying this to her, the pledge stopped and the moment of silence was happening. I walked back into my class and sat down. What I did made this teacher really mad, so she barrelled down the hallway and into my class to yell at me. I'm not submissive by any means, so I was very angry and disrespectful towards her. 

She called an administrator (basically just the vice principal) and he came in and took me out of class. His reasoning for writing me up was that I basically just broke the law by distracting others from the moment of silence by quietly walking down a near empty hallway. He didn't think that this teacher distracted anyone during the moment of silence, only me.

 I'm just wondering if this really is a law, because I've never heard about it before. I think this whole situation (disregarding my bad attitude) was very unfair.",legaladvice,t3_dkg4c1

"A psychiatrist omitted key parts of my medical history in my records, misdiagnosed me, and forced me to take medications I didn’t want.After I had an inpatient stay at a mental hospital In Michigan—where I live—the psychiatrist they assigned me to see for my med management wrote down completely wrong information about my stay. I went into the hospital because after a sexual assault at college, I tried to end my life. My psychiatrist listed that the official reason for my stay was alcoholism, because all she heard was I was drinking when the rape happened. She then diagnosed me as bipolar, which I don’t fit any of the categories for it at all. She put me on extremely strong mood stabilizers, including lithium which made me suicidal and after 6 months of taking it, I tried to take my life again and was hospitalized again. I had to fight with the doctors at the hospital to take me off lithium. My psychiatrist then changed my meds and when I kept stating it wasn’t working anymore, she kept maxing out my meds. She wouldn’t listen when I said I wanted to change to something else. She just kept pushing pills at me.

"NON-RSO Notice of termination of tenancy (60 Day No Fault?) - City of Los AngelesI posted the below in an LA reddit, they suggested I try posting here. I'm assuming at this point my friends landloard is trying to beat the clock and get them out via 60 day no fault eviction.... I'd be curious if anyone has any insight, short of the city passing the measure they're trying to pass and stop the mass evictions...

ORIGINAL POST:

Posting for a friend, I apologize if this is posted in the wrong place.

A friend was given a 60 day Notice that their tenancy is to be terminated. NON-RSO Apartment. They are currently month-to-month but have lived in the location for 10+ years. They are significantly below market rate.

Some quick research brought me to this latimes article: [https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-15/los-angeles-city-council-eviction-rent-increase-moratorium](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-10-15/los-angeles-city-council-eviction-rent-increase-moratorium)

I don't know much about non rent-controlled apartments LA, but there is no information on the document so I'm assuming they're trying to do a 60-day no fault eviction. Can anyone provide any insight? Is the best thing to do, wait and see what the city council does this week?

The last straw was last night when she called us at 10:30 wanting us to go to the hospital because he was sent to the ER again and said she was unable to get there. Today we find out the reason she couldn't be bothered to go see her husband was because she was at a haunted house with friends.

We don't think she should have custody of her husband anymore. My in-laws (wife's parents/sibling of uncle) want guardianship. How would we go about getting that done? We live in Missouri if that's a factor. Is it a matter of petitioning for guardianship in the court?

Today, marks 1 week since the incident occurred.
When I went into work last week for the ""investigation""  nothing happened at the location but I did get threatened by my superior in front of the GM and he decided to turn a blind ear to it.

The story:
I came into work went right to the office.
The office is small like 5 by 5 small its pretty much a closet. The GM is on the computer with his friend who also happens to be my superior, and also one of the names implicated on my report. The friend asks me about my report, shes heard of it but doesn't know whats on it.

 I tell her this ""The safe is electronic, its always logging entry. I just ran the report for that day.""

 She's upset she raises her voice ""I wish you would try to use that Safe. God help me cuz your going to need more than your sister to save you."" 

 I ask her straight up ""Are your threatening me?  On the clock? In front of the GM?""

 She responds:""I dont know what your talking about aint nobody threatened you and aint nobody heard shit. He didn't hear shit""

I ask the GM ""Did you not hear her threaten me?""

The GM respones : ""Im just here on this computer""

I IMMEDIATELY leave the office and call the District Coach and inform him what just happened. I also take the time to present my report. He sounded  like he agreed with me and that he would help break this stuff up but its been one week and I haven't heard anything. 

Im planning on calling for a follow up. I just wanted some help identifying all my options. Depending on how the call goes I may just quit on the spot. The environment is just so much more hostile since the $100 went missing.

Thanks in advance!

Side note about the threat:
The lady threatening me has already mentioned to me before the threat that shes no stranger to fist fighting at the workplace. ""She ain't no bitch"" shes told me she has had to clock out beat someones ass then clock back in. ""Its just something you gotta do"" She spent most of one night telling me all this after my sister came by the job to see how I was doing. She thought my sister was looking at her funny hence the threat now.",legaladvice,t3_djltbb

"Update: I make payments on a horse. The owner is extremely elderly. What happens contractually if she passes away?More than two years ago, I made a post on here about purchasing a horse via a contract that stipulated monthly installments because there was literally no chance of me being able to afford him up front. The seller was an elderly woman and I was asking about what would happen should something happen to her, since she was obviously the party that I was making payments to. I was pretty afraid of paying thousands of dollars on an animal and then having a potential heir situation dispute my ownership interest.     
I had full interest transferred to me after the first payment so it was like buying a property that was owner-financed, I guess—I just made payments directly to the seller. I recently saw on Facebook that the seller was having health challenges, so I rushed and paid off my balance with her a few months early. I have some experience in the field of elder law and I have noticed that when one thing happens to an old body, there tends to be a tragic domino effect. I didn’t want to get caught in a situation where there was any potential for conflict; I just wanted a pony...I have now cleared my debt to her and the horse’s papers are en route to me via his breed registry, to be transferred into my name. The seller’s health has since improved in while she is still pursuing some treatments, she is still absolutely as sharp as a whip and we enjoyed a nice telephone call this week.       
As for the horse: he is one hundred percent of my sanity and my life is much improved with him in it. He is gorgeous and exactly what the seller promised me that he was. He is now twelve years old, which is the prime of a horse’s life, and it shows. He is castrated, but I am in the process of contacting the owner of the sire to see if it would be possible to freeze some semen if said sire still fertile. I would like to help continue this unique bloodline, if that’s possible, since both the seller of my horse and the current owner of the stud are ladies have an advanced age.     
My horse and I are planning to make a debut at a higher level in a FEI-affiliated event in January. Everything has worked out better than could’ve been hoped for. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I’m excited to report that it may not be a train.

"Need help getting my California drivers license reinstatedA couple of years ago I got pulled over in Nevada and got two tickets. One for talking on the cellphone and one for stopping too far past the line at a stop sign. I couldn’t afford to pay them at the time and couldn’t afford to drive to Reno to make the court date. Bench warrants were issued. Irresponsibly I thought I’d just never go back to NV and that would be the end of it. Eventually I got a letter saying my drivers license and registration had been revoked. I saved up my money and payed every fine I have for California and Nevada which came out to around $3300 (there were some other tickets and late charges involved). This was in February. After I paid Nevada everything I owe them they said it could take up to two weeks for all the paperwork to go through so go back to the DMV in California to get my license in two weeks.

I waited and went back to the DMV and they say that there are still two bench warrants outstanding in Nevada for me (bc of those two previously unpaid tickets). They tell me to call the court in Reno and have them fax over the proof that I paid. So I do that. And then go back to the dmv. They say the confirmation never came through and it could take up to two weeks. So basically I’ve been going back and forth. Calling Nevada and having them fax proof to California, waiting two weeks, going back to the dmv...they print out a slip with the two bench warrants and say I can’t get my license.

"Rent on hold and thinking on leaving the countryI am not here to debate the morality of this issue. I am just wondering what are the risks for me if I leave the country, I am currently living in (Germany), without paying my lasts months of rent. 

Allow me to explain.

My landlord is a total b**** who gives no care about her tenants. Everytime I, or any of the other tenants in the building, have a problem, we try to contact her and she gives 0 f***. She never responds and will eventually send me a text about something else two months after, despite seeing all my previous texts.

For exemple, as soon as I moved in, I noticed the fridge had a serious problem which could potentially lead to serious health issue (food would freeze and melt several times) . I asked her many times to replace the fridge and after holding hostage my rent and harassing her, she finally sent someone to do it, which btw came into my apartment while I was not here and without warning. But, they didnt take the old fridge out and simply left a new fridge in the middle of my appartement which doesn't even have a freezer. This new fridge has been in my leaving room for two months now and she doesn't seem to give a single f***.

I had several other issues like this and for this reason I decided to hold my rent. Now I know I am not allow legally to do so, but I thought it is the only way to make her go into action. It didn't. And for a simple reason. This landlord I mentioned is simply an independent agent. She only deals with finding new tenants. But when I transfer the money, I send it to the bank account of the real owner, which is some rich dude I have never seen. For this reason, I believe she can't know about me not paying my rent before the owner, or me, actually say something.

I have stopped paying my rent for a few months now and no one contacted me about it. I am thinking of moving out of the country to another EU country and not pay what I owe. Plus I have no deposit.

But working there has caused me to have major anxiety, depression and overall has increased my stress levels. I'm only 19 years old, but my manager(s) have created a toxic work environment so bad that half of the people working there (most of them have said they're leaving for sure in the next monthish) and I am wanting to leave as well. They constantly yell at team members for not properly doing things but the thing is most of the time the managers don't properly train new workers. I know on my first day working I was thrown up front for cashier and shown videos on a laptop for maybe and hour and a half and was going to be shown how to do front counter when the person training (the main manager) left for the day, leaving me to be taught sorta by workers not considered trainers. They don't teach new workers as far I have been working here properly at all and I feel so bad for them. I know you learn as you go sometimes, but it's ridiculous to expect so much from someone just starting out or are often times just a teenager. They also don't give regular breaks unless you are a minor (you can get one if you work at least 5 hours or so they've told me) and I personally have gone days where I ask up to 3-5 times for one and am met with a no every time. The managers all gossip about workers constantly, and it makes me feel bad overhearing half the things they say about random workers, some of them as young as 16. When there are breaks in between rushes some of the managers like to sit around the back and play on their phones, yet yell at team workers when they check theirs. I'm almost positive but uncertain about this last thing I can think of at the time, but I'm almost positive they cut hours as a means of punishment. They don't have very many workers, but for people they talk/gossip about the most they always give them the least amount of hours. 

I guess I'm writing this because I've decided to write a letter to corporate and give them a call as well because the work environment is so unhealthy it makes me sick just clocking in. I have cried at work due to the environment twice now.  The people who are going to quit/are thinking of quitting/looking for other jobs have agreed to sign the letter once I've written it to send to corporate or wherever. I know it might not mean much, but I figured if it came from 4-6 people rather than 1 that they might actually get investigated or something.

"(TN) vehicle title transfer - power of attorney - lien pay offHello Legal Advice,

I have a vehicle power of attorney question.  I am looking at purchasing a vehicle with a lien on it.  I will be paying off the lien directly to the financial institution.  Would having the title sent to my address, and having a title transfer power of attorney executed for the vehicle be a viable way to get the title and not have to worry about the previous owner not signing the title/disappearing?

Essentially I would have the title, bill of sale, and power of attorney when registering the vehicle and sign over the vehicle to myself.

Does this sound like a viable way?

Thanks!",legaladvice,t3_dk4cu5

Two years ago, my significant other filed a Quit Claim deed granting me shared ownership of the house we lived in together.

"Salaried sales manager in CaliforniaI'm currently a sales manager for a third party retailer for one of the big 4 cellphone companies. I've been trying to understand my rights when it comes to overtime but have been having trouble understanding everything I find online. Our company requires its managers to work 5 days a week from 9:30am to 8:00pm for which they're paying us a $55000/year salary + commission. We are allowed an hour lunch which I almost never take because it's understood that if we do not hit our monthly goals we will be demoted or let go. We were required to sign an agreement last year making us exempt employees if we wanted to keep our jobs. 

My biggest issue is starting 3 weeks ago my location had a few people quit so we are severely understaffed at the moment. I've been required to work 9:30am until the store is closed now (usually 9pm), pulling double duty doing all of my managerial tasks, opening store tasks, closing store tasks, and selling on the floor all day. Because of all the extra duties I've been doing, I've been having to come in at at 9am to be able to get all my managerial tasks done on time.

There were never any signs posted on doors, mailboxes etc. letting us know this would be going on. I contacted the property management company and he also stated they did not send them anything letting them know of paving. I wouldn’t have even known how to find my car if I didn’t catch the tow truck as he was towing the last car. 

It will cost me 350 to get my car out. They also used a towing company 30 miles from me in an area with minimal public transportation, so my Uber ride will be incredibly expensive. What are my options legally as far as getting my money back?

1. I am not the owner of the home. I am a renter. 

2. I contacted the HOA, the property manager, and the PM contacted the owner of the unit. HOA says they sent all owners a notice. My owner, my PM,  as well as my neighbors owners all say there was no letter.

It states that any cars parked within 50 feet of traffic cones will be towed. I took a picture of the cones and I was much farther than 50 feet.

"Former Subordinate Continues to Spread False Information in Workplace (NJ)I’m posting this on behalf of my mom (f47) since she doesn’t understand reddit, so it’s written from her view. 

I had been working at a company in NJ for a few years and hired a young woman (f25 - let’s call her Annie) for a data entry job on the team I supervised. Soon after she started it became apparent she’s the type to spread rumors and start drama to keep her life entertaining. About a year after Annie started, my daughter joined the team doing the same job (2017). My daughter started hanging out with a few of her coworkers (m24, m25, f24) and after a night drinking at a local bar, they all came back to our house because it was the closest. The boys slept on the couch until the morning when one left early and then I told the other (m24) to go sleep in my room so I could make breakfast and go about my morning routine. The following week m24 told Annie he’d slept in my bed as a joke. He never said he slept with me. 

Fast forward to 2019, I was laid off from my job and Annie takes full credit for “getting me fired.” There’s a list of ethical/HR issues I had tried to talk to upper management about before I was laid off, specifically that I felt harassed by Annie, but they did nothing. I plan on filing an EEOC to address these other issues against the company. It’s been 3mo since I was laid off and she’s still telling people at work I slept with a subordinate, which is affecting my professional reputation. Is there anything I can legally do against her? She’s been told countless times the information she’s spreading isn’t true, but she gets enjoyment from telling rumors. Is this considered slander?",legaladvice,t3_dk6n98

"The school I've been working for wants to fire me for a mistake that isn't my fault, and expects me to sign the voluntary leave. No written contract yet after one month. What should I do?Hello everyone. 

For the last month I've been working as a teacher for an English academy for kids. The initial offer was for 6 hours a week but before I even did the first class it had been cut to 3,5 hours a week. The classes were done in two different public schools as an after school activity.  

Out of my three different groups, I was having trouble with the 3-year-old group. On my first day with that group, even though I told them I had 0 experience with kids that young, they left me alone with 8 3-year-olds who didn't understand English at all, in a huge classroom filled with toys. The class was a complete disaster. The kids grabbed these boxes full of sand and made a huge mess. Also, before I could even pick up the kids and due to my inexperience, one of the kids escaped to the school yard. After the class, I told the school cordinator that I didn't feel comfortable teaching that class.

The public school director, understandably, got very mad. From that moment on, she nitpicked at everything I did and called the English school more than once complaining about my every small misstep. The English school coordinators told me they felt very sorry for me because I shouldn't have been left alone on my first day - they thought I was doing fine with my other classes, 7 and 8 year olds, so I didn't need help - and they told me in the end it was their fault the school director didn't like me. From that  moment on, classes with that 3 year old group were done by me and the school coordinator together. 

Well, last Thursday, after class, the school coordinator and I brought the kids to the hall to get picked up by their parents. I realised we had forgotten a kid (A) back in the classroom, so I went back while the coordinator gave the kids to their parents. When I came back, the kids were in the school yard playing while their moms talked to the coordinator, and the public school director was inside the hall looking after the kids who hadn't been picked up yet. I saw this kid (B) outside with the rest, and didn't think any of it, because if he was outside either the public school director or the coordinator must've let him out while I wasn't there.

Suddenly, a mom came hysterically towards us saying her kid (B) was outside before she had arrived, and he could've left the school alone. She complained to me, the coordinator and the public school director. The mom has since unregistered this kid from the school. 

Yesterday I got a call from the English school director. The coordinator and the public school director had explained the situation as if it was 100% my fault that the kid was outside, throwing me under the bus. She also told me now they had to give explanations to the English school central for that student unregistering. I told her I agreed I wasn't a great fit for teaching 3-year-olds, and they could remove one hour from my contract. She told me they couldn't hire anyone new for only one hour - it had to be my 3,5 hours -, and that none of the other 20 teachers could cover that hour. So I was getting fired.

After that she told me they had wasted their time with me, and that she was expecting me to go discuss the issue with her on Monday and sign the voluntary leave.

I don't want to sign the voluntary leave. I want to continue teaching my 7 and 8-year-old classes, which I've been doing just fine, so it's not voluntary. Also, I wasn't told that three hours was the minimum I could work until I had already said I wanted an hour removed.

Some info:

\- I haven't signed my written contract yet. I haven't been able to check if I'm up on the Social Security but I should be able to before the meeting.

\- None of the +20 teachers that are working there have signed their written contract yet. But we've been paid for our September classes.

\- For the great majority of the teachers this is their first job, we're 17-25 max, and I'm afraid this English school preys on our inexperience to get the upper hand and thread along the legal line.

\- This has happened in Spain.

Please tell me, how should I affront the meeting next Monday? 

TL;DR: The English school I was working for wants to fire me for a mistake that isn't my fault completely. I agreed to stop teaching the problematic class but stated I wanted to keep teaching the other groups. They've told me they expect me to sign the voluntary leave. I haven't signed my contract yet, there's only a verbal contract. I have a meeting on Monday, how should I go about it?",legaladvice,t3_dk9eb5
"Apartment won't replace my AC, can I send them an ultimatum?I have been living at my current apartment complex for over 12 months now and just recently re-signed my lease. For the last 6 months, my AC has not been working properly. 6 months ago the current maintenance crew even suggested to me that my AC should be replaced but that never happened as the owners of the complex changed within weeks and with it, the maintenance crew they were hiring. Now my ac has still not been working properly (as in I'll have it running for over 8 hours and the temperature will not go below 78 degrees, sometimes it even just goes up).

&amp;#x200B;

Recently in the last 2 months, I have finally got them to acknowledge that I need a new AC but they have been lying to me and leading me on. Just last month I went to them asking for an update and the lady said they had the AC and they would install it on that Friday. When next Tuesday came around I talked to the maintenance guy and he said that they hadn't even ordered an AC. It pissed me off but whatever. I just recently found out that this can become a legal issue as of Renters Rights in the State of TX where I am currently residing. This week they told me they would get it done on Friday because the temperature needs to be right to fill in the freon (which I thought was BS) and they still haven't done it. I am considering filing a suit against them, and I was considering sending them this email, (or if I get the courage, just telling them face to face) :

&amp;#x200B;

""My ac has not been working for the last 4 months, for which I have emails as documentation and for the last two I have been lied to and led on. If my AC is not repaired by my the time I pay my next rent (Nov 1), I will be filing for a civil suit against you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is, should I even send this email/give them this ultimatum? I'm worried about two things:

* This could seem like a threat or in bad faith and could hurt my legal case
* (even worse) they use the knowledge that I am going to press charges to start preparing their defenses in advance (yeah I think like that)

I would really appreciate any advice about this. Either way I am planning to continue going to them leasing office to pester them often until it gets done. Thank you.

"My family member is a vulnerable adult. Left their parents' home ~5 months ago with little explanation and left no contact information/optionsMy family member/sibling is 18 years old. They have been diagnosed with multiple severe mental illness. This individual suffers from delusions. I lived in the same household with parents and with my sibling, so I can verify the stories told by my sibling are in fact a product of delusion and are false. My sibling used an online social media platform to post untrue statements about parents, detailing fabricated stories of abuse. I know this because I was there. This is one example of many, of my sibling's delusions.

The family began to notice drastic changes in behavior once my sibling got into a relationship. They were a teenager at this time. Their significant other \[now 19\] is one year older than my sibling. They started dating 3 years ago. These changes/symptoms onset rapidly and severely. My sibling began to extremely neglect their hygiene (never washed hands, showered, brushed teeth... basic and necessary self care). They also had sudden &amp; significant identity shifts, claimed numerous fabricated medical conditions, started to fail all of their coursework, and they got into some trouble with the police. Their behavior changed in such a way that was unrecognizable from the person we had known for nearly two decades. In reaction, parents took my sibling to multiple specialists and doctors, tried prescriptions from the doctor, provided my sibling with any supplies for any hobby that struck their interest (hoping it would be a healthy outlet).

None of the treatments seemed to help very much. When my sibling got in trouble with the police, it was because of a situation between them and their significant other, involving exchanging personal photos. My sibling and their significant other were both under the age of 18 at the time of this event. Both my sibling and their significant other were forbidden to speak to one another except for at school from that day onward. Of course, technology has become far more advanced, and even with complex restrictions placed on devices, of course they managed to get in touch and to stay in touch.

About \~5 months ago, parents found a very brief note from sibling saying they had left to pursue a career as an influencer within a certain community. They left their keys to parents' home, along with their mobile phone. They have no identification whatsoever - no Drivers License, passport, birth certificate, nothing. Their social media indicates they are currently staying with their significant other in OR.

And because they are age 18, their doctor has been of no help. Parents have struggled badly with really knowing how (or if) to take action. I believe my sibling is being severely manipulated, may even border into the territory of mental abuse/gaslighting by their significant other. I am very worried. Mental illness is one thing - I understand that mental illness alone does not mean someone cannot fend for themselves. In this situation, aside from having mental disorders, my sibling is extremely unwell mentally in a way which makes me doubt their ability to protect themselves. I get very sad thinking about it.

Parents have not called police because sibling is not technically breaking any laws. Parents have also been hesitant to get involved at all, because the significant others' parents used threatening language toward my sibling after aforementioned run-in with the police. Parents are concerned that if their attempts to get my sibling help fail, that things could escalate with significant others' parents (to a point where it is dangerous). Also, my sibling is entirely uncooperative to getting help. Feels like we are stuck as far as solutions.

"[US, PA] Landlord surprised us utility bills after over one year.We have been in our current apartment for a little over a year (approx. 15 months) and today just got utility bills for the past year out of nowhere. The bills came with a note from our landlord apologizing for forgetting about them. We went back and checked the lease and realized that under the lease these utilities were indeed not included in the rent and that the we paid them separately to the landlord. We checked our records and saw that after our first three months, we had been given and paid a utility bill for the quarter, but only that one. Before we moved to this apartment, our utilities were included in our rent, so we were used to not paying them separately and genuinely did not realize that something was amiss. The one-off at the start must not have registered, especially since it was a half-month in the summer and the bill was relatively low.

I've emailed the woman on my case but it's Saturday and her replies come a week later. Does anyone know what my move is now that the case has been dismissed? Do I petition for a new date? I couldn't find anything on their site about next steps...

"New management company wants to change terms of apartment lease from monthly to yearlyMy boyfriend and I have been living in an apartment complex for the last few years. (He was already living here a few months before I moved in with him.) The lease is a month-to-month agreement, and this was a big reason my BF chose this particular complex. 

In the middle of September, we received a notice that the current lease would expire at the end of October (October 2015 was when my BF first moved in) and that we’d have to sign a new lease. We didn’t really think too much of this; the complex recently changed management companies and we figured they just wanted their name on all the tenant leases. 

But then about two weeks ago, a packet of paperwork was slipped under our door — basically all the stuff you sign when you move into a new apartment: various agreements about damages and security deposits, as well as the new lease, which clearly indicates a year-long contract. Basically, it would kick in November 1, and we’d have to live here through October 2020. Should we decide to move out sooner, we’d owe two months’ rent. 

My BF and I are floored that they’d change the lease agreement without any warning or grace period. We have plans to invest in a house soon and don’t anticipate being here for another year. We have been trying to contact the rental company for over a week, but it’s a faceless corporation. The woman in the management office keeps referring us to the regional manager, who has not called us back. She’s also “not at liberty” to give us his contact information when we asked to call him directly. 

We feel like we’re being held hostage to a lease we never agreed on. We’re good tenants; we have always paid on time and have never had any problems. This new company has done a terrible job communicating their changes clearly, and they’re not handling our current concerns at all. 

At the same time, I’m not sure what our rights are as tenants and if failing to sign a new lease by November 1 would have any legal or financial ramifications. Advice?

"Is it too late to do traffic school?I got into at at fault accident several days ago for failure to yield. I ended going to court to pay the fines for it and the clerk told me that if I had the option to just pay the fine OR go to traffic school and get the benefit of not having the point show up on my record. She warned me that I could not take traffic school twice within an 18 month period. 

Well, here's the thing. I had gone to traffic school to get my LICENSE (I was 17 that time) like 6 months ago. When she told me that I couldn't do traffic school twice, I didn't know that this rule was only reserved for VIOLATIONS.

"Cited for 50 in a 30 - Questions / Advice?Hi Redditors,

I’m a 21M and got my first speeding ticket a couple months ago in Lexington, Georgia. I have a flawless driving record besides this. My court date is coming up and I have a few questions.

First off, the officer said he caught me on radar doing 58 in a 30, but he cut me a break and only wrote the citation for 50 in a 30 (58 in a 30 is still written in the officer’s  notes at the bottom). It was night time and the two lane road I was on was out in the middle of nowhere and didn’t have much on it. It was also my first time being on that road and in that area in general. Additionally, I thought the speed limit was 55 because that was the last sign I noticed. After continuing on my way after the traffic stop, the next sign I saw said 55 as well. I’m guessing I was caught in a little area of road where the speed limit changed and I wasn’t aware. I only saw the sign that said 30 on my way back and it probably lasted less than a mile before becoming 55 again. I was polite and respectful to the officer, but I wasn’t going to argue with his decision to cite me.

Should I just pay the citation or should I go to court? And as someone with no prior court experience, what would be my options if I do go to court?

I’ve heard some people say I should plead not guilty and respectfully try to argue about radar calibration and deflection angle which I don’t know too much about. I’ve heard others say that if the officer doesn’t show up to the court date, the ticket is dismissed and that I should go and hope for that. I’ve also heard people say that if you show up to court ready to plead not guilty, they’ll offer to reduce the ticket as some sort of plea deal. I also heard something about moving violations being reduced to non-moving violations or a plea of no contest leading to driving school and little to no actual penalties?

I don’t know if all of this is true or not, but my instinct is to just go in and tell them “Hey, I’m just a college kid with a perfect driving record up to this point and truly didn’t realize I was speeding because I had never been on that road before and just missed the sign. I appreciate the officer cutting me slack and only citing me for 20 over, but I truly thought I was just going 58 in a 55 and I’m sorry.”

Anyone sharing any advice regarding my situation is greatly appreciated!

Thanks!",legaladvice,t3_dk8rt2
"Step daughter adoption helpI would like to adopt my step daughter but before I put eggs in any basket and get hopes up, I figured I’d ask someone who might know...
My wife and I got married when she was 7. Her bio father has never been 100% in the picture. He would occasionally get her for a weekend when she was younger (maybe up until she was 10-12ish).

He will occasionally text her (maybe once every 6 months or more). But makes zero attempt to be in her life. He had another daughter about 5 years ago and more or less completely gave up on mine.

Context. 

On a night out, not anything hectic or anything. Friendly get together (with an astounding turnout of people), my buddy got knocked in the nose for being mistaken of doing something, energy escalated into him getting knocked again by the same guy. I step in after seeing my buddy with blood pouring from his face, diffuse the situation and get this guy to stop his aggression towards everyone. At first, I succeeded without force, peacefully and easily (somewhat). I let it go and thought it was all okay. I then find out that he’s doing the same bullshit to other people, and again, the idiot I am steps back in to confront him and talk some sense into him. The tension escalated and turned into his ego and stature being threatened, when that wasn’t what I intended to insinuate. Nonetheless told me to back down or step up, I did nothing but hold my ground. He walked off all pissed and aggressively.

"Automatically Renewing Lease in Ohio.Hey, guys.  

My wife and I signed a lease in September 2016 to rent a house for 24 months. The lease basically states that unless we give notice, or the landlord gives notice, the lease will automatically renew for a 12 month period at the end of our 2 year term, and will continue to do so until we move out, or the landlord intervenes.  

We are going to start the process of buying a house soon, and will likely need to be out of our lease before the end of the current term.  

I have no reason to believe the landlord will see a problem with this, as overall, he's been a great landlord. However, incase he does take issue to us needing to leave(with proper notice), I need to know if I'm reading this right. 

A website I found(link removed) says that Ohio law puts a 3 year limit on these kinds of leases if they aren't notarized, which ours is not. However, looking at the laws they've quoted, I cant understand how any of it pertains to my situation. 

Are we basically month-to-month now? Would we be okay to leave with proper notice?

"I believe my company is committing Medicare FraudOklahoma

Basically the title but some details. Not my main account in case someone I work with finds this.

I work in the medical field. Basically my job description is traveling to patients homes to perform a medical test. I’ve been with this company for 10 months. The pay is great, auto expenses and gas covered, and quarterly bonuses. I love my job. Once I’m done with the number of patients I’ve got scheduled I get to go home. I also get the freedom of meeting my patients earlier in the day if I feel like and finish earlier. It’s honesty a great gig. 

The way we get referrals for patients are that our sales reps go around the state to more rural areas and get primary care physicians to recommend patients to do the test. The reps tell the doctors to send us patients that have certain symptoms or a certain medical history as they would qualify for the test. It’s a specialized test and not everybody benefits from it, so we need a certain type of patient with a certain medical history or symptoms to be able to do the test. 

Over the last 3 months especially, we’ve gotten patients referred to us that do not qualify for the test. We go over the medical history with the patients and ask them what their main concern is, and many of these patients will not benefit from this test. We’ve (myself and the other 2 techs) have told these patients that there’s no need to have the test done so they refuse. This has been causing stress in the office because of many patients refusing to have the test. Our bonuses depend on how many studies we get done during the quarter, so many in the office are not happy when a patient refuses. We’ve talked to our supervisor(one of the owners of the company) about the quality of patients we’re getting multiple times but he says that’s not his department, that falls on the Lead Sales Rep (another owner). 

Over the last couple of months, I’ve come to find out that this Lead Sales Rep(owner) has been telling they doctors he sees to send us certain patients for “pain”. The doctor gives him the list of patients in his office that see him for pain management. The Lead Sales Rep then calls the patients himself to schedule the test with us, telling them that our test can help determine how much pain they’re in (he’s already been told this is false) and that if they refuse that they’re medications will be accepted (which we don’t have the ability to change their treatment plan, and is of course unethical). 

On top of all this, most of our patients are on Medicare. Many are older and can not think critically wether what they’re told is true or not. I feel that this is highly unethical, possibly fraud since the company bills Medicare for a test, giving a certain diagnosis code that is automatically approved by Medicare for the test, but the actual reason for the test is completely different than what is being billed. 

I know it’s a lot to read, but any insight on this will be appreciated. I will edit this post as I answer questions.",legaladvice,t3_djtob5
"Business client is avoiding $410 payment for products already sold on a consignment deal.EDIT: My Location is Indiana, US.

Starting with some background, my contact with this business started in February, 2019. We were both small businesses. They had a storefront selling CBD and I was building a CBD brand from scratch. I've worked with a handful of retail shops and this is my first time having a problem doing consignment. The stores I work with understand that payment is not due until the product is sold and that either party is allowed to initiate a return or exchange on unsold products at any time.

In June of 2019, they closed their storefront because they were losing money. I accepted a return for their remaining stock and their remaining balance due was $410. This was for the sales they made and had already collected the funds for. As a side note, to me, 67% of this balance is product costs and 33% is profit. Based on the price they sold my products at, they received an equal $410 minus their costs.

I gave them extra time to make payments and let it sit for 3 months before contacting them for payment. I went back and forth texting the two involved and received no response for a week. Once I called them out, I received a response.

"Aunt wanting dog back she gave to us after she was cruel to him LONGEDIT: location is UK - will be posting on r/legaladviceUk 
CONTEXT: My uncle was diagnosed with brain cancer in January this year. My aunt and uncle have one 7 year old daughter and a now year old welsh border collie dog. Whilst my uncle was alive, she gave him illegal concentrated cannabis oil while the doctors backs were turned, and stated she was ‘basically a nurse anyway’. 

In January, my mother, sisters and I went up to visit him in Manchester, and also checked on their dog which was at home. When we arrived, he was stuck in a tiny cage with no food or water available. He could not even lift his head up properly. My aunt informed us he would stay in there all day (8-10 hours) until she came back from hospital (no one came to let him out or water him, it was chance we visited him as we wanted to see him as a puppy). We were appalled by his conditions, and when we let him in the garden to run, it was clear he had never been trained the entire time my aunt had had him (confused, couldn’t look at us, frantic movements). When we left him, we put him in her kitchen with fresh water available and all hazards taken away and put out of reach. My aunt was furious, saying he peed and pooped everywhere. 

My aunt then started handing him round to various people who would take him for periods of time. My mother eventually suggested, as we have two dogs already ourselves (a spaniel and a border collie, so we understand his needs) that we could take him in May. My aunt was pleased and agreed that we could keep him long term in July. We sent him to residential training while we were on holiday at a cost of £2700 as he needed to be trained professionally (he was now 10 months old and didn’t even know his name). He continued to live a happy life, loves my other two dogs and is finally becoming normal. 

Three weeks ago my uncle passed away. My aunt until this point, had never mentioned her dog since we took him on. She had no relation to him, it was as if he never existed. At my uncles funeral last week, she told my mother she wanted him back. My mother kindly said no, as my aunt does not have the capacity to care for him. This week my aunt exploded at my mum, threatening legal action if we don’t return him. The court papers she sent contain untruths, and insinuate we ‘stole’ him from her. My mum is ready to give up as she doesn’t want to go to court. I can’t see Dash go back to my aunts household to be caged up again in a tiny cage, never let out or walked.

For background- I live in California and the apartment was a part of the school..sort of (renting to only students at the school, but not dorm like). My apartment was a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom however my lease for my room was under my name and my roommates under hers.

I rented an apartment unit near my school from for the 2018-2019 school year starting in August and my lease ended back in June. I moved out and everything was fine, I just had to wait about a month for them to inspect my unit and mail my deposit with money being taken out if damages needed to be covered. I called a month later as I had yet to receive and they told me they would take care of it: I received it and deposited it.

Now fast forward to 3 weeks ago. My ex-roommate from that apartment nonchalantly asked me if I had received my deposit and if so how much. I told her yes and that I received the full amount. She then got all pissy and threw a fit because she had to pay for cleaning and repair to the microwave. She was a messy roommate but as for the microwave, there was nothing wrong with it and it was clean before we moved out so I don't know what they fixed. I assume she proceeded to email them that I didn't get billed and so now the apartment complex has sent me an email that I never paid an outstanding balance for microwave damage worth $82.50 that I was unaware of 3 months after I've moved out and they need it ASAP.

"Condo owner kicks us out to repair damaged flooring after a flood we didn't cause.CanadaMonths ago (June) the condo unit above us flooded and damaged several units below, including ours. The only thing ruined was the flooring and our landlord told us he wants all of it to be replaced eventually. Fast forward to end of September we get an email telling us we have 2 weeks to move out every bit of furniture plus find a home to stay in for 10 days. The worst part about this all is that it was completely out of our own pockets. We paid for movers, a storage unit, and we didn't get a cut on half the month's rent for leave, hydro or anything. Since we work full time jobs we can't take off weekdays to move and he hasn't offered to assist on any of this. It feels like we are being punished for a flood we didn't cause, any advice?

"[Tennessee] medical insurance form with PPACA violationsHello! 

I started a new job a few months ago, and my employer said we would have health insurance starting November 1. 

This week, we just got the sign-up form for insurance. My boss's boss sent everyone an email saying that we each needed to fill out a list of our pre-existing conditions and that our premiums would be based on that list. 

The detailed instructions said not just that, but also that we needed to list every medication we'd taken in the last 18 months, and every condition we had been tested or treated for in the last 5 years (including our dependents' treatment). Also, it explicitly states that this information will be used to approve or deny coverage and to determine premiums.

"My neighbor is trying to appropriate my yard.Hey everyone,

Ohio checking in. I am living in a house that is on a corner lot due to an alley running down the left side of the house, drawn below. We moved into this house 2 years ago and there was no mention of a covenant or easement for our neighbor to access her property, but our backyard was fenced short of our property line and our neighbor parked an inoperable vehicle in the space. 

 https://imgur.com/gallery/uOmQlA4

We asked the neighbor to move the vehicle and it was towed away. We proceeded to build a new fence that enclosed our entire backyard. This fence includes a gate on both ends of the drive, with the installed on the inside being paid for by us. We do have a survey showing us our property lines and we do not encroach on her property. This fence has been built for a year now. Finally, we paid to have a driveway put in so we can park in our newly gated driveway.

Our neighbor texted yesterday to give intent that they will be using our driveway to either park or use as a passthrough to a driveway of their own that they plan on building. We have not replied. We are thinking of acquiring a lawyer and putting better locks on both gates. I assume we need to retain a lawyer.

So in total we have $150 in credit. We spend about an hour shopping and make our selections based on our credit.

"Retaliated against at work for whistleblowing.I work for a local government in Georgia. I have proof of illegal activity committed by a co worker. I took this to my supervisor many times. Instead of reprimanding him, my supervisor would give him more and more support. I have to work with him closely, and at times I have been forced (he is in a position of authority) to do those illegal activities by proxy (I just hand out documents on his approval). One of my other co workers finally took this to our city marshal, who is  police officer. The marshal opened an investigation and asked me to comply on several occasions. I did. 

During that investigation, the city marshal asked me to come along with her to present the case to the city attorney, not to give evidence, but because the laws in question are so specialized she didn't want to give false statement in ignorance of what she was talking about. I didn't actually end up speaking with the attorney, I was clocked out of work and I stood on a public sidewalk the entire time. 

My supervisor put me on probation today and suspended me for not following chain of command, claiming it was inappropriate for me to tell anyone about this. The human resource manager claimed that I was being reprimanded for going outside of my department and outside of the city with the information. 

I explained to them I actually didn't even speak with the attorney, and that I wasnt there to give evidence. Only to explain the code. They said my mere presence there was inappropriate. 

A code enforcement officer also went along. He did not get written up, though he had a meeting with my supervisor the same day.

So this youtube grifter and his followers has been harassing me over the internet. He figured out my Facebook profile and after a couple of messages insinuating violence he moved to a video call.

Right of the bat he called me a F*** and a N*** and proceeded to insinuate violence. 

I want to report it to the police because he told thousands of his followers to go after me so I’m getting tons of insults on social media and a couple of no caller Id calls that I haven’t picked up.

Instagram is not doing anything about his posts asking his followers to go after me. He already told his followers where I live, the name of my wife, my real name and gave them screenshot of my Facebook profile. 

Facebook doesn’t have a way for me to report the harassing video calls or a way to stop the harassment.

So the only thing I can think of is contacting the police and getting a restraining order but not sure if I should give them the phone call recordings.

"School called CPS on meLocation (TX) 

I’ll try and be short. (Trash account) 

CPS and Police were called because of something my 7yr old said at school. Apparently this kid at school told my kid “your moms gay and you have sex with her”. My kid then told the kid back “no you have sex with your dad”. But instead of saying YOU, she said l. So it came out “ I have sex with my dad”. The teacher overheard and informed the principal which the called police and cps. So my wife and I were asked to wait in the hall while they questioned my kid in a room with the principal. They came out and told us that they don’t feel our children was in danger due to the answers my child gave. The office said that my kid said they didn’t even know what “sex” meant. By this time CPS was still not there. 

The officer said he called CPS back and told them what happened and that everything was ok. He then told us that we may still receive a call from CPS as part of their protocol but they were no longer on their way. They let us all go and gave us a case number. 

I should have prefaced this by saying I would never do anything like that to my kids. I guess for me that goes without saying. 

My questions are 

Will CPS conduct a visit even though police gave them their statement?

Should we cooperate with them? I’ve seen horror stories on here and other sites where wrong accusations turn into loosing parental rights because a house had dirty dishes. 

Should we contact a lawyer for any reason? 

Like I said, I’ve read and heard horror stories about cps and my wife and I want to be prepared to handle them.




UPDATE:

So the social worker showed up unannounced a while ago. I took the advice of being positive and inviting. Offered a seat and something to drink. Social worker asked what I felt were basic protocol questions and told us case will be closed next week. Apparently a call still has to be made to a person that knows us and our child’s relationship. I gave 2 references and that was that. The social worker told us how to have the case redacted from records. &lt;— I think that’s the right word. 

All in all I believe this is the end of it. Unless anyone has heard of CPS saying one thing and doing another? She was nice and rather quick. Told us there is no reason for her to believe the child was/is in any harm or danger.

"Nurse administered wrong shot by mistakeA few years back, my wife was either pregnant or had recently delivered (don’t recall which).  This was during flu season. Her obstetric practice recommended that she and I get either the TDAP or DTAP vaccine (again, don’t recall which.

We went to a national pharmacy chain which offered the vaccine, filling out the forms for the necessary vaccine, and received what we thought was the TDAP/DTAP.  We received some paperwork and went on our way. When we got home, we looked at the paperwork and realized it was all relevant to the flu vaccine, not the vaccine we wanted. I called the pharmacy back and asked which we had received; they said it was the flu vaccine.

I asked for, and received, a copy of the consent forms we had signed; we clearly had signed forms for TDAP/DTAP, not flu.

I ended up calling back the next day to complain; the nurse I spoke with was the one who made the mistake. She got all nervous and offered to visit us at home to administer the correct vaccine. I obviously declined.

Anyway, I complained to the pharmacy manager and then the district manager. I really didn’t plan to sue or anything, but wanted to make sure they didn’t administer the wrong vaccine to someone else. (What if they had given the wrong vaccine to an immunocompromised person?!)

We ended up not dropping it after the district manager made it really obvious that the person who screwed this up would be disciplined and that they got the message, but I’ve always been curious... should I have reported this somewhere else?

Approximately, October 31st of 2018 my Mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, she beat cancer, but shortly after removing cancer she began to develop liver problems.

Here is where the problems really begin. She went out to an Indian Tribal Casino and at the casino, a community member accidentally bumped into her, and she fell down. At first, she says she didn't feel pain, but she ended up breaking her hip. The casino would NOT call for medical attention until a release form was signed under duress at which time they called for assistance, after this incident she was taken to the hospital and released two days later. Then, began to have pains and was rushed to the hospital. At this time she was now in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for 5 days with her organs failing and she began to aspirate into her lungs, the hospital was unsure why, the only way to diagnose her would have been to ventilate her, but she would not be strong enough to come off the ventilator. They thought it was blood in her lungs or pneumonia, never got a confirmed diagnosis. The family decided to not ventilate and slowly take her life with hydromorphone. The hospital sent us in the mail the other day that they will not cover the charges of the ICU because they were not liable, but hired a firm to come to the conclusion of who is liable, the casino, community member that bumped into her and made her fall (accident), husband or the hospital?

The landlord is a commercial apartment leasing company based in Columbus, OH. I moved out on 6/8/19, but I believe that under Ohio law, I have a couple years to file a claim.

1. Extension of Lease

My prior lease contained a clause about the tenant needing to give the landlord a 60-day notice to vacate. The apartment leasing manager (landlord) sent me an email on 4/17/19 asking if I would be renewing my lease. I replied the same day with the following text:

""I will not be renewing. I plan to move out at the end of June. I might need another month, I’ll let you know.""

He then responded with:

""Thanks for letting me know! Please just keep me updated so I know when to get your 60-day notice in.""

I never responded to this email, as I assumed the case was closed. But then when I went return my keys, they stated my lease had been extended to 7/8/19, since I never ""officially"" put in my 60 day notice.

I had fully paid until 6/30/19. The amount from 7/1/19 - 7/8/19 amounted to approximately $600. I paid this amount even though I had not been occupying the unit for over a month, since I didn't want it to go to collections.

Is this legal? Do I have a chance of reclaiming the $600? I feel like the extension of the lease is illegal, given that I indicated in my email that I would not be renewing.

2. Refusal to replace AC unit

The AC unit for my unit could never get the apartment above 66 in winter, and it could not cool the unit below 78 in summary. I have copies of all the maintenance emails of me asking them to repair it. They would respond with ""it has been fixed"", but the problem was never resolved. I have emails of me stating that the floor got so cold I had to have a blanket on my feet or they would get numb. I also indicated that I had to wear a parka inside my apartment to stay warm.

Is it possible to recoup any kind of damages based on email evidence? I also have very high electric bills from the winter time, ranging from $250 to $400. The apartment leasing company also owns the electricity provider, so there is a conflict of interest in them not wanting to replace the AC unit with one that actually works. I'm not sure if this could be used as good evidence that the AC unit should have been replaced when I asked them to.

It is also worth indicating that I lived in this unit for 4 years, and paid every payment on time.",legaladvice,t3_dk5y47

"Threatened with Lawsuit-Photography Client-Watermark issueI own a sole ownership photography business in TN. I am being threatened with a lawsuit from a client. Client signed contract in January 2018, event was photographed in September 2018.  Client received over 800 professional watermarked digital images in November 18. Client emailed me on three separate occasions after they received them praising how wonderful the images were.  

Then in October 2019 (11 months after they  received the images) client writes and complains that they printed the images and they had our watermark on them (small watermark, lower right hand corner of all images) and wants a full refund. Client saw that we watermarked images when they went to our website to hire us, when they met with us before the wedding and we showed them sample watermarked images of ours, and after they received all of their images because everyone of them was watermarked and yet praised us via three emails on how much they loved them. 

Then when client goes to print them (11 months later) and sees the watermark is still there, they threaten to sue. Not sure how they expected what they saw when they viewed their digital images with watermark they would not be watermarked when they printed them. 

 In our clients favor, our contract did not mention watermark usage, we thought since we clearly showed them our images with watermark when they hired us and on our website they would just know their images would be similar with  watermark applied which is standard for plenty of professional photographers. 

My questions are: 

Is there a statue of limitations on when they can sue us and when does it start...when the contract was signed, the wedding date, or when they received the images in November 18? 

It just doesn't make sense to me how the client received and loved the 800 images with the watermark on them and praised us for the quality of our work and how much she loved them and then 11 months later wants a full refund due to the watermark being on their prints, what am I missing? Please help me understand their point of view and is it valid?

 Why would anyone think the watermark would disappear when they printed them? 

How much does it hurt our case that our watermark usage was not on our contract since all images on our website, and the ones we showed them as our samples before the wedding, and the ones they received that they loved when they got them had the watermark on them? Wouldn't it be like a car salesman showing you a car to buy and then you buy the car, and you absolutely love it, and you write the dealership and the auto maker a five star review, and then 11 months later you determine the car does not have enough trunk space for you because you never opened it and you demand a full refund?

What are my liabilities? They are demanding a full refund..can they claim damages and be awarded more, or that I would have to pay their attorney fees?

"Speech Arts Teacher practicing discriminationIn a California middle school, a speech arts teacher at school that had the improv team. About three times a year, the team put on a performance for the whole school. On one of the performances, she didn’t allow a subset of the 8th grade population. It was the UC Davis team which had all the special ed students as well as mainstream students in it. 
I am guessing she discriminated on the basis of disabled kids. But she probably thought it was a legal loophole by not allowing the whole team from seeing the performance. 
Even if she didn’t discriminate on the basis of disability, not allowing part of the school population from seeing a school performance sounds illegal because they should be open to ALL the students since her production is funded by taxpayers-she was a school employee and using school property to execute the rehearsals and performances. All students should have equal access to all school activities.
If she had her own production outside of school funded by her own money, then she can deny admission to whoever she wants, but it’s wrong doing that on a production funded my taxpayers. Legally, she didn’t even own any of the productions that she created at school because she was an employee of the school district and since it was created within the scope of her employment, the school district owns the rights to the production aka work-for-hire.
Anyways, am I correct on how it’s illegal to not allow part of the school population to see her production?",legaladvice,t3_dkcghi
"Help, boyfriend has not been paid in 9 weeks and has been working 30-40+ hours for those 9 weeks!Hey guys, I need some advice..
I'm also not going to provide the names of the companies involved, because I do not know if that's against the rules.

So my boyfriend finally got a job, he has been working at that job for 9 weeks.
He hasn't gotten paid a single cent. He's gotten absolutely nothing, originally it started with the bank he was with.
He didn't pull any income for a few months so his original bank closed his account. So another new bank was doing free accounts that you can sign up for.

So once he started working, he opened the account and they told him he'd get the card between 4-7 business days. He signed up online by the way, this is important.
So a week passes, no card. He went into the branch, he brought his social and driver's licence thinking he could withdraw money for rent. Nope.
They say said he would need the card to access his money, but they could do a two day delivery for his card so he can access his money.

So he went ahead, three days pass, nothing. He went into another branch and that branch said that our local branch NEVER sent the card. They said he would still need to wait for a card to come in so he can withdraw his money, but they could two day him a card.

Waited another three days. Nothing. He went back to our local branch and they blew smoke up his butt and said they would have it delivered to the branch within two days. Waited a week because they said they would call us when it arrived. Nothing. Called, no card, no access to the money, do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars.
So we're pissed and I thought I had a brilliant idea to have him talk to payroll.
He talked to payroll, they advised that they can pull all of the money they sent to his account and it can be sent to my bank and he can just set up direct deposit to my account. We agreed since my bank has been set up since 2005 and I've never had issues. 

So we have been calling payroll every day for the past couple of weeks and he has not been paid. They have the correct account, we understand back pay will take a while, but he could at least get his weekly pay. Instead, they keep telling us it should have arrived by now, but we've gotten nothing. Now payroll said their hands are tied and he'll get a call and an email when they money goes through.
He has pay stubs, but has not received a penny.

I forgot to mention that if he actually went into the branch to sign up for the account, they would have given him an ATM card on the spot, but since he signed up online, they could not.

Also this is a temp company he is going through, he hasn't been hired on with this warehouse yet, but now at the 10 week mark, he is not going in anymore until they pay him. 

We have also went to the Kentucky Labor Cabinet but they haven't given us any updates just like his HR department for 2 weeks now.

Okay, so for starters we live in a neighbor that's been going bad lately, robbery, breakins, and fights outside. My house is connected to another one.

"[CA] Car was totaled, just received notice of a lien on vehicle from tow-yardLast Wednesday our car was parking outside our house on the street and somebody side swiped it. When we went out there witnesses said it looked like he lost control of his car and his tie rod may have broke. He was only 22 and very shaken up. He called his insurance or road side assistance (He has AAA insurance) I’m not sure which. The tow truck comes to take his car and the guy asks if we want them to take our car as well. I was reluctant because I wasn’t sure what we were supposed to do. My husband called our insurance (GEICO) and they said we should work with his insurance since he was at fault. 

The tow truck driver gave us his card which had the AAA logo on it. He said they could take both cars to the same place and it would help the insurance claim go faster and that they had a repair and body shop there as well. We figured since the guys insurance was AAA and they sent the tow truck, it was probably the best option. 

Thursday my husband calls AAA and they have no information yet. Friday he calls again and no update. He told them both days the car was towed with the other car and they gave him an address and asked if that’s the location where it was. My husband confirmed that’s where the car was. Sunday rolls around and my husband is getting annoyed he’s using his truck to drive to work, especially since gas is over $4 a gallon now. He called AAA regarding rental coverage. They said they were waiting on a statement from their insured (who walked away from the accident with his dad saying they were going to go call the insurance to file a claim). She said they couldn’t do anything regarding a rental until that.

Monday finally he gets a hold of the personal handling our claim. They ask for a copy of the registration so they can remove the car from the place it was and take it to a collision center. That was the 14th of October. Monday afternoon he got a text from the collision center that they were starting to work on his vehicle claim. 

Yesterday I got the mail and received two letters. One DMV form stating the towing company put a lien on our vehicle. The other was a notice of stored vehicle/deficiency waiver. The notice date was 10/16- 2 days after the car was taken from the tow yard to the collision center. It says we owe $400 storage to date at $50 a day. The car was only there 6 days (was 8 as of the date of the notice though). We also owe $472 for the towing fee and $70 for the cost of the lien processing. My husband called AAA insurance but they were already closed and said call back Monday. The collision center called and said the car is most likely totaled. They sent the estimate to AAA but visible damage alone is like $7k on a 2012 Corolla. 

From what I was reading online, we were responsible for mitigating the damages and making sure our car didn’t rack up excessive storage fees. We assumed (which I am now realizing was stupid but we didn’t know what else to do) that the insurance was handling things since they knew where the car was. At this point I wish we would have just went through our insurance and then had them try to recover from AAA, but we figured since AAA had both cars together it would go smoother (which I realize now was incredibly stupid). 

Are we responsible for the towing fees or will AAA likely cover them? Does that amount come out of the check we get if the car is totaled? Also, is $472 about right for a tow 4 miles away? From what I saw online it seems rather high, but I’ve never paid to have a vehicle towed before. There’s also a box on the lien notice that says, “My towing and storage was authorized by a public agency” and the box is checked. Does that mean AAA authorized it? 

Lastly, since my husband has been driving his truck to work for the last week, can we claim loss of use for the car we haven’t had since he’s paying a lot more in fuel costs? At this point we are wishing we went through GEICO, but now that the car has been looked at and the estimates sent over, it also feels like we should suck it up and just let AAA finish the claim. The whole lien notice has me stressed out though! Obviously my husband will call them again on Monday but I’m really worried about how potentially screwed we could be getting.",legaladvice,t3_dk5htz

"My Uber account was deactivated because someone hacked my information 

# My account was deactivated because someone hacked my information

📷

About a year and a half ago, I signed up for Uber but never took any rides-no one was wanting them when I was available. A year ago, I noticed a weird deposit into my bank account. I researched it and discovered that someone had hacked my Uber account and made fraudulent ""trips"". Like, going to a town that is 30 minutes away and getting a 60 dollar tip in 4 minutes. Nearly 1700 dollars of these ""trips"". As soon as I discovered it, I notified Uber. I called 4 times and got the run-around each and every time. Each one of them saying ""I am forwarding this to our specialized team to investigate and someone will get back to you."" No one ever did. I ended up having to have 2 surgeries within 2 weeks of each other and waited until I was healed before reaching out again.

On the phone with them for 35 minutes yesterday with him putting me on hold every 2 minutes to ""investigate"" finally coming on and saying that I am deactivated because of the fraud. I'm like, ""The fraud that I didn't commit and that I notified you people of? Seriously? You people allowed my information to be stolen and someone has that information. They have a copy of my driver's license, my insurance card, and my bank account information,"" I asked for a supervisor (had to be placed on hold for another 2 minutes) and went over all the information again. He said that he would forward it to the ""team of highly specialized agents"" and ""someone would get back to me"".

I got an email last night stating that my account was permanently deactivated because I violated the terms and conditions. HOW? I never did a run and my stupid account was hacked!!!

What about the fact that someone over there messed up royally and ALLOWED my information to be stolen?? What about the fact that the IRS could come down on me for nearly 1700 dollars that I never received?

Screw you Uber, I'm done.

What can I do?  I want this fixed.

"[FL] Hydroplaned and hit a guardrail last night. Florida Highway Patrol came and claimed my license was suspended, took it from me, and gave me a fine, even though I went through the whole process to get it reinstated last yearI ended up hydroplaning on my way back home for the weekend from college, and practically totaled my car.

"Denied handgun purchase in RI, didn't pursue an explanation at the time, when I called months later they refused to dig through the paperworkI assume it was because when I was arrested about 15 years ago after a mirror was broken in an altercation with my father. In RI destruction of property is considered domestic violence. In domestic violence cases the state must pursue charges if the police are called. I got a domestic violence charge and had to attend batterer's intervention for breaking a mirror.

Is this likely the reason i was denied a handgun purchase? The denial was about 7 or 8 years ago. The domestic violence charge does not show up on my background check, oddly. The only other things on my record are a since-expunged shoplifting charge and destruction of property in DC during a protest.

I guess they didn't find anything because I grew up with my parents.

From a young age I have struggled with mental issues. I'm pretty sure I had pretty bad anxiety when I was 5-10 (undiagnosed, though I had frequent chest pains, was nauseous all the time, and stopped eating, etc.), and into my teen years and now I've struggled with depression. There were also a few really weird things I did when I was young, starting before the age of 4, that make me feel like something had to have happened to me. Into my early teen years, my household was physically abusive, and I got a little too personal in my personal statement draft for college apps, which lead a teacher to fall CPS for me when I was 18. Nothing happened since I was an adult and didn't want anything to happen.

I'm 19 now and I've been in therapy for the past few years, trying to work things out. I want to know if something happened to me, even if it wasn't such a disgusting thing, or maybe another report.

the lady originally said we used 650 cubic feet of water, and before 8am this morning i knew nothing about typical water usage so i assumes that was super high. (this is our first time living in something other than an apartment, we’re just three 19 and 20 year olds here.) when we called back after realizing that 650 isn’t all that high, they changed the number to 68,000. confirmed that number multiple times. they said they’d send someone out on monday to check that our meter is working properly. 

we don’t have any leaky toilets, no sprinklers or faucets outside, nothing. everything is brand new. all the other units are apparently using water normally. i have no idea what could be the issue here. my concern is that we’re going to get slapped with this 2200 dollar bill that we can’t afford to pay for water we aren’t using. i asked if that number could be for all the units altogether, i was told no.

"[NEEDS ADVICE] Workplace Bullying/Harrassment Then Fired (Florida)Hello Fellow Redditors,

I wish I was coming to you with a better circumstance, but usually here we have something going on.

I worked for a Brazilian startup tech company that relocated to Florida.  I was recently fired for apparently missing days, which were sick days that I was approved for and was told to stay home specifically and work from home.  Then the other reason was vague, something like a poor attitude/morale.

This is where the situation comes in.  My main boss and my supervisor are married. His wife (the supervisor) strongly disliked me for no discernible reason.  I still to this day do not know and I was only let go a week and a half ago. She would slam doors in my race, turn the lights out in the bathroom if I was in it, one morning I had shut my eyes because I had a migraine and she stood up from her desk to get 2 inches from my face and snapped in it and yelling “wake up,” and would block me off from using the break room so I sat in my car every day for the three months I worked there and cried. HR sat a few desks away and could see all of this going on and I felt like I could never talk to my boss about his wife, so I just kept to myself and didn’t talk to anyone. I was promoted to start a new campaign they had and they moved me to an office by myself so things were getting better.

I had food poisoning and was not in the office for 3 work week days - I worked from home, was clocked in, and even worked that weekend without pay for this campaign with doctors notes telling me not to work and my boss telling me not to come in and just work from home.  Being harassed and bullied in an environment where I did not speak Portuguese in a predominantly Brazilian staff also meant I could hear insults and jokes about me and pick up that I was being harassed though the “team” would just say “it’s nothing” and laugh. I don’t know how at all I was supposed to be chipper and happy in this environment and was set up to fail. 

I also was never trained to do my job. My boss was sick and out of work 5 days from my start date in, and the supervisor refused to help me for whatever reason, so even three months in I was struggling to use a system not in English, but I was good at my job and I loved my job. They recently had to rehire someone his wife (the supervisor) fired because he hopped in our slack groups to say goodbye and that he was never trained and had no guidance as he was solely work from home. They deleted his messages and rehired him.

My boss was very open about refusing to hire black people, and was the office was very open about “it’s a boys club, you are going to have to deal with vulgar stuff but you’ll play along, right?,” and were uncomfortably open with telling each other that most of them didn’t have visas and were making so much money here.

I am not a malicious person, this was just a job I saw myself turning into a career. When I learned this said supervisor had people I had never spoken to file a group complaint against me when I kept to myself and kept asking my main boss if I was doing anything wrong with the repetitive “no” answer and even the morning of the day I got fired the HR manager and my lead boss told me my job was safe (both in text on Skype) ..,, it all is very frustrating as with zero notice &amp;amp; I was doing very well it was out of nowhere,

Do I have any recourse here? If so what can I do? I’ve never done anything like this before,

Edit: Several other things I’m remembering now:
- Had a meeting with my boss about not being trained properly and my hours changing, nothing was changed 
- Started working from 9-5 to 7-3, then abruptly was changed back. My main boss knew I had counseling in the early AM and it fit better which would leave me to sit in an unsafe parking lot for an hour (people constantly shooting up in FRONT of our door as it was in a secluded strip small which I complained about multiple times that it was a mental health trigger to see that &amp;amp; not to mention the biohazards of needles laying around and homeless people sleeping next to the doors).
- I repeatedly ensured that/asked that I was doing everything right and always asked for more work, and always was very nice to everyone. I said good morning to everyone, made coffee, and after the wife/supervisor started to detach she had the whole team going out of their way to not interact with me.  
- I was going to be trained originally on a weekend of a girl I barely knew who was with a very abusive guy at the time, he shoulder checked me and she would not train me. She ran up to me one day at the start of work telling me to walk outside and change my passwords to everything that he had hacked her work computer.
- We could work 40 or 100 hours a week and only get paid for 40.  We got paid once a month and I was an hourly employee.
- Good to note that the company is about 30% an MLM and have multiple BBB complaints that weren’t resolved as they had a constant issue of not returning money, locking people out of accounts, and not giving them the services paid for. The commission structure/how things were run would change weekly.

"Please Help! New neighbour's construction damaging my property (Toronto, Canada)Hi all,

I have an issue with our new neighbour right now and would really appreciate any advice. New neighbours have purchased the home next door to me, and are doing construction, building it from the ground up. They have permits, but I noticed their construction has been affecting my property.

Examples:

* Using our driveway for their concrete truck and damaged my lawn while backing up
* Using our house wall as support for bracing with wooden beams (the beams are past the property line and are against my wall)
* Lots of scratches and pen writings on my wall

I've reached out to the City of Toronto's building inspector and City Councillor with images of how they've been treating my property, but there has been little help and the inspector said they had come by, and everything was to code (they took down the bracing beams when the inspector came by).

I also tried speaking to the owner and contractor numerous times. They feed me empty promises that they will respect my property, but everytime I come home there's something new that they've done where my property has been damaged. They refuse to put anything in writing to guarantee my property will be respected/liable for any damages.

I feel like they are flippers and just want to get the job done and sell it asap, so there's no fear of any consequences.

"Company owes me over $80 in expenses [ON]I worked for a company which required us to drive a company vehicle to various public places and  park. As such we had to pay for parking.

We were told if this happens, get the receipt and we'll be payed back. I worked for the company for about 4 months and never got paid back.

"Abortion gave me cancer- Can I sue?Legal action is something I considered before, I never really felt comfortable given the reason to discuss with lawyers/ask around. This was three years ago but now I'm a college student again and money for my pain would taste pretty sweet.

&amp;#x200B;

I was 19 years old and my birth control (nuevo-ring) failed. The father had severe type 2 diabetes, and refused to let anything ""waste"" what time he had left. I decided on an abortion and had to drive an hour away as the only nearby hospital was Providence, a religious (but kind) hospital who again such things. I opted for a Lovejoy Surgical Center in Washington State, my state of residence. I went through all the paperwork asking me not to sue and signed, but recently learned that sort of thing isn't binding. I was told the procedure was a success and has a list of symptoms that I was assured was completely normal and that I needed to call my doctor (gp, not them) if I passed, very specifically, two golf  ball sized blood clots, had a fever, or a few other major symptoms. I had none of these but persistent bleeding and pain beyond what  I expected. After 2-3 months I went to the doctor for it (my doctor who referred me required a check in) and I was  told my symptoms weren't normal. I was sent to the hospital and told I had a blockage in my cervix that could be cancerous and I was knocked out and back on the table at Providence in less than a couple weeks. I was informed afterwards that it was in fact cancer and that the material has not fully been removed from my body and a large mass of it was stuck in my cervix, and them began to grow while bleeding in my cervix in a way that they called cancerous.

My question is if I can sue for malpractice. To this day 3 years later I have severe cystic ruptures and some digestive trouble I did not previously have. This can't be clearly linked to the abortion, but the cancer can.

"Dad [61m] opened a credit card in my [26m] name to buy my step-mother [43f] gifts and can't pay it back. [IL]Last year I was laid off from my job due to the company phasing out my department. I was given a healthy severance which allowed me to pay off my student loan debt and car loan. It left me debt free and I found another job paying slightly more for the same kind of work about 6 weeks later.

Fast forward to Tuesday morning and I get a letter from what looks like a collection company. The claim I owe over $6000 for a credit card debt. After calling the credit card company directly, I learned a card was opened in my name last September and the address on the account is my dad's house 150 miles away.

I called my dad and asked him what was going on since I knew he hasn't really had his finances in order for most of his adult life. I'm polite with my step-mother but we aren't close at all as she hates my mother. My dad and I have never been super close but over the past couple years he's gotten even more distant, I think a lot of it has to do with my step-mother. Basically he admitted to opening the credit card in my name to buy a bracelet for his wife, a week long trip to Chicago and a few other things. He then had the nerve to tell me I could pay it off with my severance, which was the end of the phone call.

"What can I do about my ruined (expensive) view?First time poster/throwaway account/on mobile/TLDR at bottom

I don’t want this to come off as a r/choosingbeggars post and I 100% understand that this is very much a first world problem. Just curious if I have any merit here. 

Also, it’s kind of impossible to tell the story without giving obvious clues as to where I live so there might be some details left out intentionally so I can feel a little safer while still getting the advice I need. 

Some context:

I moved to Seattle, WA in May for my job. I wasn’t able to physically visit any potential housing before the move but I found this girl on Facebook marketplace who was trying to sublet this place two blocks away from the Space Needle. We face timed multiple times so I could see everything and she told me all the ins and outs of living there. It was perfect and one of the major perks of this apartment was a beautiful full view of the Space Needle from one of the windows. I was thrilled. (She ended up just breaking her lease and I signed my own.)

I only got to meet my landlord the day I got my keys and he showed me around the building. He never had to ‘sell me’ on the apartment because I had already signed the lease. 

At the time there was some construction happening at the bottom of the hill/street but since none of the buildings around it were taller than 3/4 stories, I wasn’t too concerned. I thought, ‘yeah, maybe the bottom of the needle will be blocked but I’ll still get to see most of it.’

As the months past it kept getting taller. Eventually, I looked up how tall this thing was going to be and turns out, it’s going to be an 8 story luxury condo. Now that the final story has been built, I can only see the antenna over the top of the 8th floor. 

I do have a few safety concerns about the location of my front door and there was an incident a month ago that involved me calling the police and I have made my landlord aware of my concern. Other than that and me being annoyed at this obstruction, I really like my building. I signed a 12 month lease and I’m curious if at the end of my term can I ask for a lower rental amount since the major appeal of this unit is gone?

Alternatively, I’d be willing to move up a floor or two, if I still could have somewhat of a view (obviously only if one is available).

TLDR: Moved into an apartment that had a great view of the Space Needle, after 5 months that view is 99.9% obstructed by a new building, can I ask for cheaper rent?",legaladvice,t3_dk8gfk

"RM Are Being DicksI am unsure as to the legality of what RM have done, and that's why I'm here.

So  in South Lanarkshire, in Scotland (unsure about rest of UK for what happens), all the school computers are managed by the same organisation - in our case, RM. They control the internet access and block inappropriate sites within schools.

They also have some sort of agreement with microsoft so that we all have microsoft accounts for school use only, and this enables us to download and use the entire microsoft office suite at home for free.

There is one problem with this though - they take control of the privacy tab in the computer-wide settings app without getting the consent of the user first. You just open up an office app, and it tells you ""The privacy settings on your device have been updated"". So I go to check my privacy settings, and sure enough, there is a message saying that some options are controlled or hidden by my organisation. ON MY HOME COMPUTER.

As said before, I am unsure whether this is legal or not, as it is my computer but my parents are the ones who signed the internet access documents.

"Potential Labor Rights Violation-ColoradoHello r/legaladvice,

So my fiance and my roommate both work for a large ski company based in Colorado. They both recently had their performance reviews and subsequent raises. They compared their wages with each other and noticed that my roommate made more money in his raise than her. Before I continue this I feel like I need to explain the layout of their department management structure below. Starting top to bottom in order of department hierarchy  


General Manager  
\-Department Manager (will call them Karen)  
\---Service Coordinator (we'll call them Samuel)  
\-----Office Manager  
\--------Fiance &amp; Room mate  
\-----------Office Staff  


So both reviews were conducted with Samuel. Well so my fiance went to Karen and spoke to her about the wage difference and didn't seem to understand where it came from. Karen talked to Samuel who gave an answer regarding performance differences blah blah blah, which is his right as management to make (while Karen believes Samuel to be a little sexist that is not the point of this whole thing). Samuel then met with my roommate and my fiance separately and told them they are not allowed to discuss wages with each other and further discussions would result in possible punitive measures. Now it is my understanding is that wage discussion is protected by the 1935 Nation Labor Relations Act and was further strengthened by President Obama's 2014 Executive Order titled Non-Retaliation for Disclosure of Compensation Information. What should our next step be? Should we contact a lawyer? Should we bring it to HR?

In a few months time I will be have a court hearing in regards to child custody. We've ready gone through three hearings prior.

I usually get her to take it down but I know he or his family will have taken screenshots of it as he has been watching all my online activity on a near stalker level.

I fear that when the court hearing arrives he will use these against me and say my mum is unstable and that the child shouldn't be living with us.

"My boyfriend purchased a used car off of eBay from a dealer in Maryland, only to dig up absolutely abysmal reviews of their business practices. There is now $8600 on the line. Maine, USAMy boyfriend found a car on eBay the other day from a used car dealer in Maryland. There were dozens of pictures of the car, inside, outside, and underneath as well as a lengthy description of the car and the CarFax. Everything looked in great shape. It was listed for $7700, $500 of which they wanted through eBay immediately as a non-refundable deposit.


BF put the $500 deposit on his credit card through eBay and minutes later, a man called to explain the rest of the proces, said BF was going to receive the documents to electronically sign and send back. In addition to the $7700 sale price, BF was also expected to pay a $600 shipping fee, and a $299 'Dealer Processing Charge'. So $8599 in total. The paperwork was signed and sent back, and two days later he managed to wire them, outside of ebay, the rest of the money from two separate accounts- part from BFs credit union and part from his checking account. 


Upon further investigation, we realized all the positive reviews for the seller's ebay account were for being a buyer, not a seller. I then checked google, yelp, and numerous other sites, where I read dozens of reports and reviews from others stating that they had the exact same experience, and once the car was delivered it was in terrible shape and it looked and ran nothing like the listing described. All reviews also go on to mention that once they requested a return or refund for the items, the sellers refused to comply and usually blocked their numbers and cut off contact. There are also numerous open complaints on the Better Business Bureau that are unresolved for the used car business they are selling their vehicles online from. It also appears that this seller often opens new eBay accounts for this dealership to sell their cars. I'm assuming this is done once they start getting negative reviews for their fraudulent selling practices.


Once we saw this he messaged the seller through ebay stating that he would like to cancel the transaction and receive a full refund. They refused to correspond further through email and told me they'd call the next morning with a to ""discuss [my] options.""


That night I also contact the police department in their city to see if they had any issues with the dealership in the past, but, aside from giving some advice, they're unable to help much since it is considered a civil matter.


I took the call this morning and spoke to a man who said the car hadn't been shipped yet. He told me that most of the purchase price, minus the Dealer Processing Charge, could potentially be refunded. He also made it clear that he is under no obligation to refund the money at all. He told me that regardless, he doesn't handle these transactions, his boss does, and they can't handle them over the weekend anyway. He then also said that in order to go ahead and ask his boss to potentially initiate the refund at all, I was required to review them positively because he 'has a business to protect' and said that he wouldn't proceed to ask his boss to refund the transaction, and that there would be no possibility of getting our money back, until the review was posted. There was no real implication from him that the refund was guaranteed, and by the end of the conversation I was not confident with the information given. 


As it stands, the car is still on the lot at the used car dealership and will not (should not) be shipped out. They have $8599 from that they're holding all of, and are only maybe potentially willing to refund $7800 of if we leave them a positive review. I was advised by an eBay representative to discontinue contact with the seller from here on and file a reimbursement request, which I did.


My questions are-


- Can any of the three transactions (the credit card charge or either wire transfer) be reversed or covered by the banks, credit company, or eBay?

- Aside from filing another complaint with eBay or BBB, what are my next steps?

- If it came down to having to sue the dealership, where would I begin, (what kind of lawyer would I be looking for, what would be claim be officially)

- Basically, at this point, what is my recourse?",legaladvice,t3_dk6f12

Both us and the bride's sister made clear that we wanted everything that belonged to us to be removed at the end of the night.

We had a special liquor license for the event and the following morning the venue dumped out 5 full unopened cases of wine that were left on the premises. (They were within their rights to do this as the license would have been expired)

The coordinator gave us back (almost) everything that was left behind as we expected, but then claimed they didn't know the cases of wine were ours. Legally, it could not have reasonably belonged to anyone else. Although they claimed took on the phone for the mishap, they have been dodgy and deny responsibility in email/texts.

The contact at the venue knows exactly what was left behind and can attest to that fact. We wouldn't have hired a coordinator if we knew they could just deny responsibility for things that, to us, seemed like reasonable coordinator responsibility.

I have 2 insurances through my father's work. A primary and a secondary. I was automatically given medical assistance from the government after I began receiving SSI for having an autism spectrum disorder. I didn't apply for it, they just gave it to me. It has never been billed because the first two insurances take care of everything.

The doctors office that canceled on me said that it was a law that if you have medical assistance it must be billed before any other insurances you have and that they didn't accept people with medical assistance as patients. I haven't had this problem with any other doctors office including other doctors offices in the family of healthcare that this office belongs to.

Is this actually a law in PA and if so can they actually deny me care for this?",legaladvice,t3_dk1omu

"Husband’s affair partner’s spouseI just recently found out my husband had a year-long affair from 2017-18 with coworker. His affair parter’s husband found out a year ago and this caused the affair to end and them to separate and divorce. Apparently it was part of their agreed upon terms that my husbands name was kept out of things to protect both of their jobs. She told my husband that she gave something up in divorce settlement to keep her spouse from suing my husband for alienation of affection. 
So I assume her now ex-husband signed some type of NDA saying he wouldn’t ever drag his name through the mud. 
Not sure if that would mean he couldn’t contact me as well. 
My husband has been pretty forthcoming about this- and several other things I found out about. He had long ago deleted all correspondence in this case (not so with others), so I cant help this feeling of wanting to fact check what he’s telling about this relationship. At least so far as frequency of meetings, etc. 
So my question - if I contacted him, he can he legally talk to me about all of this? Just don’t want to bother reaching out if he legally CAN’T.

"How do I protect myself (and others) from slander from my ex employer?Hi all, 


I'm located in Western Australia. I recently quit a job I'd held for nearly six years as the working conditions had become so intolerable that my mental health had become very poor. 


It has come to light from things said to current employees about me that it was an intentional move of my former boss and their new spouse who had no grounds to fire me. They immediately replaced me with a family member who I had thought they were going to replace me with.


They have slowly phased out all original employees to replace us with the new spouses' family and friends. The tipping point for me was the firing of another long term employee and their attempts to start claiming he had physically attacked the boss in order to tarnish his reputation. We have reason to believe (though cannot prove) that said boss went through his phone to delete all of their text messages that prove that this did not ever happen. (They were seen fiddling with his phone for too long when they were meant to be using it to call someone right before the messages disappeared.) 


I felt extremely unsafe working there and walked straight out of my job when I found out about it. Since then a narrative has been built that I have been taking advantage of my boss for my entire time working there and that I also pre-meditated leaving as I had taken some time to clean the desktop of the computer the day before leaving - something I had done so that myself and other staff could find important documents straight away instead of needing to search for them. I did also remove anything personal from the computer immediately before I left as that makes complete sense to anyone with half a brain. 


I am, of course, concerned about the damage they will do to my reputation knowing that I will most likely continue working within the industry in some capacity, but I am EXTREMELY concerned about what they're saying about my co-worker. I can say with 100% certainty that he did not and never would physically attack anyone, let alone his boss. But as my ex-boss is well liked and respected for their honesty in the industry and the entire business employs only the spouse's family I've no doubt they will provide false witness to this.

What can we do to protect ourselves? What they say about me is bad for my reputation but easy to disprove, but what they say about my co-worker has the potential to really damage his whole life. And it would seem that they've no problems doing things that are illegal and immoral to get at him.  

I've been told that people who know him will know this isn't true - but I just feel that I can't rely on that.

"Employer asking competitors not to hire even after non-competeHi guys,

I worked for a company for three years and signed a noncompete agreement with them the lasts for 1 year (12 months) after employment there.  I left on good terms with the company, and am now looking for opportunities elsewhere in the field, since it has now been 12 months since I left the company.  I contacted a competitor that does consulting on my ex-employer's software, and they say that my former employer has asked all its competitors to not hire any ex-employees until 18 months after they stop working at the company.  Others in the industry have confirmed that this is happening so the competitor I'm looking at isn't just giving me the run-around or something.

Some context on the company - The competitors of this employer rely on the employer in that they offer consulting on a software product that the original employer produces.  The employer could essentially blacklist the competitors and seriously hurt the competitors' business, as competitors need to be able to log into the main system to see existing issues, solutions for the software, etc.  That is why the competitors agree to honor this new unofficial noncompete, I imagine.

This seems seriously legally sketchy.  I know my ex-employer used to have employees sign a 2 year noncompete, but that didn't hold up in court so they modified it to be 12 months, which is what I signed.  This is an international noncompete, not just the region or anything.

Is this legal?  If not, how would one go about voicing this issue in a legal context?  Class action?  Don't want to get ahead of myself, but jeez this is kind of messed up because I've been traveling for the past 12 months and planning on getting back into the industry now that the non-compete that I signed is up.

"Advice about a landlord violating a lease?Sorry for any typos, I'm on my phone and cannot type well as I'm having issues with the internet, the reason for this post to begin with.

I live in apartments located abovr some businesses. A couple months ago the building owner hired construction crews to do work on the building, and they completely tore up our fiber lines. It took up until a week ago to get it fixed and reinstalled, as the fiber company wanted to make sure it didnt happen again, &amp; they couldn't get into the building where the equipment was located without someone letting them in.

Fast forward to today, and they cut through it AGAIN. Instead of being angry at the construction crew, the building owner is mad at the fiber company and is completely removing their services to put in spectrum. When I voiced my disagreement to this, I was told by the landlord ""if you don't like it, you can break lease and leave. We were providing ypu with free internet as part of the lease anyway""

Now here's the thing. While i was getting the fiber provided to me for free, it was none of their doing. When i first moved in the building in 2014, my unit that was supposed to have been fiber ready was not. So i went through the hoops of getting it installed, with my own money, and paying the bill every month up until the fiber company merged with another company, and the deal was since i was already a customer before their merger, i would get free 100 up/down for the nect 10 years. So the building owner has nothing to do with it. They provide building wifi for free, sure, but I've never been able to utilize it because my unit is at the end of the hall and can't connect to it.

Do I have any legal grounds in keeping the internet I originally signed up for? Or am I SOL because ""building owner can do what he wants""",legaladvice,t3_djwg9z

So his grandma has been helping out with the rent since like June, and of course she knew we were using her card.

Its almost like $5,000 and I live in a low income apartment.. They're saying The grandma disputed the charges on the card, and they barely got notification NOW after 5 months and expect me to pay it all again by Monday. But the grandma denies the dispute, And her accountant and everyone is saying that she never disputed the charges. 

 My leasing office told me that they had to pay the cardholder back, But the grandma has not received any money back what so ever, and I've been using this card too for September and October that has still been confirmed paid as of now, so where the hell is all the money at?? She said if she got the money back, she'd give it right to us for the payment. But They will not give me my September and October rent back which is still confirmed as of now, and they told me that they are proceeding with the unlawful detainer process and I will be served Monday.

"Dog got out and bit someoneI live in Washington state. I live with my soon to be ex-wife whose boyfriend also lives in the house. He brought his dog with him and the dog has been living in the fenced back yard for a while now. It's a medium to large size dog (not sure of breed) but he will try to attack anyone who isn't my ex or the boyfriend. I was told the dog needs more training before it can be around other people. 

The dog got out of our fenced yard at some point today and bit a child. I found out about this when my ex asked me if I knew anything, all I know is I did not hear the dog at all today (he barks at anyone passing by). Someone posted in one of the community facebook pages about their child getting bit but sounds like they weren't seriously hurt. They did report it to police but the dog is still missing. 

I'm want to make sure that I am covered legally as I have nothing to do with the dog's care, I don't even have access to the backyard myself when he is back there because I would be attacked. 

Should I contact the police and tell them what I know? Assuming my ex has not already declared a dog on the premises (99% sure), should I contact our homeowners insurance company? I am currently planning on moving out in March if that makes any difference.

"Two month Apartment Construction has gone on for two years!!!Hi all, looking for some legal guidance on some construction near my apartment that has been going on far longer than we were told. 

So in December 2017 my family and I moved into an apartment(me, wife and one yr old). Landlord told us the apartment building next door was going to be under renovations for a few months. We had concerns with the baby napping, but loved the apartment so decided to deal with it. Fast forward nine months and construction is still going on. Again we’re told construction was almost complete. Ok, we’ll deal with it. Fast forward to Feb 2019, my wife is pregnant and the construction is STILL NOT DONE. Naturally we’re concerned about having a newborn near the construction(mostly for napping). The window is facing the construction. Again we ask our landlord about construction. He asks the owners again who claim they’ve been dealing with health issues, but apparently assure him it will be complete in April 2019(baby is due in May). There is a sign outside the apartments that claim availability “early fall” that’s over a year old!(lol) We decide to stay as to not disrupt things too much with the new baby on the way. Baby comes in May, construction is still not done. In fact, things look even farther from done than ever before. One day I go to leave in the morning and the entire garage/car port area is completely torn out. I see this and freak out. I press my landlord to get an exact time for the construction ending. Again apparently the owners tell him it will be completed no later than September. Alas, here we are in the back half of October and the construction is still not done.

I told the landlord today we would have left before the baby was born and his response was basically “Good luck finding a deal this good.” We pay four grand a month for this place. Frankly, at this point this isn’t even about the baby anymore. I’m sick of being lied to. My question at this point is if I have any rights to exercise as a renter?

"Landlord keeps cutting 3""x3"" holes into our wall when fixing the plumbing, covers them with tape and says they will be back to finish it. Never has.So to preface this, I dont actually care about any of this but my wife is pressing on it so... 

Also some further background, I live in a one story ""condo""? Its a 7 unit building, 3 of the units are privately owned, my landlord owns 2 and the other 2 have separate owners.

Anyway, we have lived in the unit for 2 and a half years. A few months after we moved in, there was a leak from the drain under the tub that caused our spare bedroom to get flooded essentially ruining the carpet in that room. We brought it up to the landlord and 2 weeks later they came and tore out some sections of the wall in our shower and fixed the leak, covered up the holes with clear masking(?) tape, but did nothing about the carpet and told us we should keep the window open and fans blowing to dry everything up. Which is what we did.

Fast forward some months and now we have a leaking faucet in our tub, get that fixed with a few additional holes in the wall covered in tape and an open hole in the ceiling where the shower head protrudes from.

Another year goes by and we have another leak from the tub faucet. We tell the landlord but they say they are too busy right now and they will come fix it when they can. 

A few months go by with the leak becoming progressively worse and us asking them to come fix it and them doing nothing about it when one day landlord comes by and wants to put some dye through our drains to identify a water leak(we dont pay water utilities, landlord does) and I explain to them that is unnecessary, I know where the leak is. They fix it the next day after cutting a few more holes out of my shower wall. It was a hot water leak so even though we dont pay water, our hot water heater has been constantly running costing us on our natural gas bill. Landlord refuses to compensate.

None of that actually bothered me too much, not enough to care anyway.

But a couple of weeks ago as I was getting home from work one night my wife smelled gas outside and the police and fire department had to come and investigate and we had to evacuate our house for the night and during that time my wife had asked the county sheriff who handled the situation how to deal with all the unfinished holes in our shower wall and he told her we should refuse to pay rent until they were fixed.

Well, Landlord came by while I was at work to collect the rent and my wife told them that we wouldn't pay them until the work was finished. I'm not entirely sure what exchange of words happened because my wife is foreign and doesnt always fully understand what is being said especially in heated or quick discussions but I know they mentioned eviction.

We haven't documented any of this, we pay cash monthly for our rent so there is no record of transactions, only our initial lease agreement, so I have pretty much assumed were screwed.

We live in Montana if that helps.

Does anybody have any insight as to how to handle this situation? I'm still at work so haven't been able to take any action.

"Condo Association Ability to Foreclose for FINES?I've done a few searches and been unable to find anything that definitively answers my question. It seems the answer of course varies by state. In my case, I'm in Georgia.

My question is, can a condo association foreclose or place a lien on an owner for fines, not dues, not assessments, but fines?

Here's why I'm asking. My own condo association right now is run by a group that is honestly megalomaniacal. The condo bylaws do give them the power to impose fines on homeowners, but do not specifically lay out fine amounts or any specific actions that result in a fine. In the absence of this clarification, the board does as it pleases, promulgating its own rules and imposing fines for anything and everything, with no limit on the amount imposed other than by their own collective whims. The rules broken often do not result in any property damage. For example, one homeowner was accused by the board of renting her unit on Air BnB, with a $1000 per day fine imposed, for a total of $3000. The homeowner appealed the fine, stating they were guests while she was there, but the board's position is that the homeowner is guilty until she satisfactorily proves her innocence. The board couldn't even find an online listing for this supposed rental. Of course, no manner of evidence satisfies the board and the fine stands, accruing interest just as an unpaid due or assessment would on the association's books.

I always pay my dues and assessments early, if not on time. I have never been fined, but I feel a need to speak out at our next board meeting. The board has published resolutions (resolutions are at the board's discretion, with no homeowner input or vote) stating that fines can be imposed for ""disrespecting"" the board. I know that I have a right to freedom of speech, but of course, the board can claim anything I say is ""disrespectful"", such as questioning them, if they so choose.

If they fine me, I have no intention of paying. I will of course continue to pay my dues, and even go to court if necessary to defend myself, but I don't feel I should have to pay fines for speaking my mind or simply displeasing the board. They likely would make the amount ludicrous out of spite. In the past, they have fined people for posting fliers on doors speaking out against them (""littering"") and taken away access to homeowner's parking spaces for unpaid fines of this nature. A particularly nasty tactic I've seen is that they will fine homeowners that are known to be unhappy with them. The homeowners will refuse to pay the fine, and then will be told their vote does not count when board elections come around. It seems a very simple way for the board to disqualify anyone who even intends to vote against them. The board knows no one will challenge them over this and spend the $5K+ over a vote to try to take it to court.

Anyway, can a condo board in Georgia just impose fines as they wish, then restrict access to parking and ultimately foreclose on an owner's home, even if the home owner remains compliant in paying all dues and assessments on time and in full?",legaladvice,t3_dk0agt

Because this was found the day the landscapers were on site, it's really unlikely a human could throw a rock that small hard enough to shatter tempered glass, and the landscapers have broken windows on other units with their equipment before......I'm pretty confident that's what happened this time.

HOA says there's no evidence and they won't pay anything.

The neighbor who alerted us to the broken window said the same thing had happened to him and the HOA covered it without issue So I didn't take pictures of the initial damage. Since the damage, about 2/3rds of the glass has fallen out so the size of the original impact site is based on my memory.",legaladvice,t3_djr1oe

"Question about Suing(USA, CA) So, recently my university that I attended was being a big old, well, you can figure out the word, to me. I have a disability, namely autism. I found out from a group that works with universities that I was supposed to be given a disability rights advocate during meetings and such. I was not given one. I talked with a lawyer buddy of mine, and at first he said it could be discrimination against me, due to the fact that not only was the university treating me like a child, by acting like my education didn't matter and  almost talking to me in a very condescending manner when discussing things, he felt it was discrimination, and I could be liable to receive upwards of 200,000 up to a million dollars in restitution. I then went to another attorney friend of my mothers, and he said it could be a mixture of things like Tort law, discrimination law, etc, and he didn't know how much I could receive as a result. How can I properly sue my university for these issues, and I can go more in depth if necessary. Note: I am not doing this for the money. I would make them pay through the nose, so they know not to do what they did to me to other students who might have a worse disability then I do.",legaladvice,t3_dk5uc9
"Roaches in storage unit/ illegal dumping- VirginiaToday I was helping one of my sailors meet with one of the reps in charge of moving her storage unit back to her home. The people helping her move had to stop because they noticed roaches inside all her storage boxes. Due to this infestation, she couldn’t move her belongings today until the infestation was cleared. 
We contacted the public storage representative, and they had said they knew of the roach infestation but usually people self-bomb their units AND they do routine maintenance. 
We called an exterminator to properly come to the unit. The exterminator found holes upon the ceiling with roaches swarming around the property and unit and said the roaches have been here longer than she had the unit (she signed for this unit two months ago). There was roach eggs and roaches the size of my thumb. After trying to clean up this mess, several of our helpers put the roach infested boxes inside the dumpster with other items other storage unit people had already placed and left. 
She received a phone call from the manager saying if she didn’t come pick up the boxes from the dumpster, she would receive a 500 dollar fine for illegal dumping and they would be contacting the police. We ask where else we could place the boxes, and they said it needed to go inside her personal vehicle and be dumped somewhere else. 
Upon arrival they had put their personal lock on her unit until she removed the boxes from the dumpster. I reviewed the sign near the dumpster and it said “private container, dumping is a crime” but it was placed on the other side of another storage unit not on the dumpster. Her car is now filled with roaches. 
Is there anyway she can get some type of compensation for this mess? She had to pay 400 already to get plastic storage containers and an exterminator, along with next month’s storage unit payment because she can’t move this week due to the roach issue.",legaladvice,t3_djwhvu
"Are the homeless a protected classes in California? If so, can a business refuse service to someone just because they're homeless?Ok I currently work at a gas station. We have regular customers coming in, including this one homeless man. Despite him being a paying and regular customer, my boss doesn't want him using the bathroom. Recently he chewed me out for letting him use it and made me tell him he can't use it anymore, as he was buying his items. I did give him a wink to let him know I will still let him. Of course this man is a customer, so he's not technically breaking the 'customers only' policy. But my boss  insist that he can't use the bathroom. It is his store so he can ban anyone he wants for any reason, but of course there are limits to that. From what I can gather you can ban anybody if they are part of a protective group,  especially here in California. Race, religion, disablities. What about the homeless? Is my boss in the right to refuse service to homeless person? Can my boss refuse a person access to the bathroom even though he is a paying customer? Can my boss fire me for not enforcing his dumb rule? Can he fire me if I called corporate and report him for this? Who else can I call?

"My boyfriend has a wife and needs to get divorced but she is transient and appears long enough to be an annoyance in our relationship and conveniently disappears anytime divorce is brought up.We are currently living in Oklahoma together. We have been together 3 years, they’ve been (legally) married for a little over than 3 1/2. He regrets this marriage, obviously, but is looking for a way to just get it done, without her if at all possible. She currently lives in Portland, OR, and they were married in California. 


I don’t know if this matters, but i guess there’s paperwork you have to file after marriage to change your name on your social security card, etc. She never did this, would that matter or help us in anyway?

"I never registered my car under my name after my dad sold it to me. My name is on the title. Can I sell my car without registering it?Not sure if this is the right place for this question, but here goes:

About two years ago, my dad sold me the car that he bought for me, for $100. He wrote my name on the title and we both signed it. This happened in Florida, where I now know that you have 30 days to register the car after purchasing it. I failed to do this because I didn’t understand how vehicle registration works. My mom has since renewed the registration under his name, so the sticker on my license plate is up to date. It expires in December, and the car is still registered to my dad. 

This past July, I graduated from college and moved to Colorado for work. I haven’t registered my car here yet. Again, the Florida tag expires in December. My car isn’t really suited to the terrain and climate here, and I want to sell it soon. Would I be able to sell it here as long as my name is on the title? Or would I have to have it registered in Florida, or here in Colorado? If I could sell it before December without having to pay registration fees, that would be ideal.

Finally, he wrote a written statement saying he “inferred, from the security camera that it could be _____, but that he wasn’t sure.” They pulled the other kid into the office, and he admitted to throwing the water bottle.  Because of this, they are now giving my little brother 3 hours of detention next week for “wasting their time”.  This is a public high school in north Texas. Do I have any leeway here?

"I gave my landlord 2 weeks notice, and they demanded I pay them more than I owed. They are filing a claim against me, and I want to defend myself in this matter. Do State Landlord-Tenant laws apply to tenants-at-will?This woman has repeatedly harassed me and invaded my privacy, and there has been no legal agreement between us. I was a ""work trader"" on her ""WWOOFing"" farm for nearly 2 years, and I suffered a bad back injury and was unable to use my back for anything for over a month, I was stuck in bed. During that time she harassed me and urged me to work with a herniated disk in my back, which my doctors strictly advised against. I had $388/mo income at the time and she was demanding I pay $400/mo, then increased my rent with less than a week's notice.

I finally found a job and worked out a way to escape her oppressive farming operation that was causing me depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. I was working for no pay, and was living like a serf. Meanwhile I was offering her skilled labor that would've provided me with a much better living situation if I was mentally healthy and able to work more than a little bit each week.

Because of the vulnerable position that I was in, I agreed to all of her terms without signing any legally-binding documentation. I knew I would not be able to pay what she was asking, but I told her I would, as I was already at a point of desperation and needing to escape what had become a clearly abusive situation for me. She has caused me extraordinary amounts of pain while I was feeling threatened to become homeless while being unable to get out of bed for over a month while recovering from a back injury that had me in the worst pain I have ever experienced.  


I paid her on the 1st of October for an amount that paid her in full until the 5th of October. I told her that I would be gone by noon on the 15th, and knew that she was liable to invade my privacy and confront me, so I packed, cleaned, and left on the night of the 14th. She was well-paid considering the living conditions (no refrigeration, outhouse shared by sometimes 8+ workers, 300+ feet away from my dwelling) I would often provide services free-of-charge and she would often intercept me and interrupt what I was doing to ask for help. I don't believe that this qualifies me as a ""tenant-at-will"" necessarily, because I always paid with work trade up until I hurt my back, and then I couldn't afford it, and now that I moved out and have a job she is trying to extort me.

What are my rights to defend myself?! Is agreeing to her demands for me to pay her via instant messenger legally binding, if the reason I lied was to keep her abusive behavior from continuing while I was suffering? If I was not as risk of being kicked out while injured, I wouldn't been able to stand up for myself, but all I could do at that point was just agree and lead her to believe she was in control of the situation while I planned my escape.

I have reason to believe that I can file a counterclaim against some of her unlawful acts. But what am I? What is a ""work trader"" considered under law? Not an employee, guest, or a tenant? I did agree to pay her, but she is a 70 year old woman who I have witnessed do some downright mean things to people who have come to work on her farm. Should I send a cease and desist letter?  The State of Hawaii recognizes that I have a mental disability, and I swear this woman has harassed me more than I can even tolerate. Her threats are preventing me from focusing on my job and I want to stand up against her bullying. I left peacefully, paid her nearly in full, minus $133 due to her being cruel to me. What tenant rights would apply to me in this scenario? Any information you can share with me on this matter would be highly appreciated. This woman is using people for free labor and in violation of WWOOFUSA's Terms of Use, but I can't risk giving her any more information to use against me in court.

"Hospital Privacy Violation [ME]This week I had my first doctor's appointment at the family practice of a major hospital in my town. I signed up for their online system to keep track of my bloodwork results and prescriptions on Tuesday of this week. Today I was billed for $700 and logged into the account to see that two people I do not know were now on my account, one person with the same first and last name as me (but diff. middle initial) and someone else with just the same last name (assuming daughter or family member of the first person).  

These people have extensive medical history that is visible in my account (prescriptions, visits with specialists, procedures) all in great detail, as well as medical debt. I've been in contact with the hospital to alert them  and they told me the info would be taken down in two hours, but it has not yet been taken down 3 hours later.

The hospital didn't seem terribly concerned with the privacy breach and said they'd be in contact by Monday to make sure the billing issue was corrected and that this was not affecting my credit.

"My mom is neglecting a horse she claims is mineWhen I was five my mom brought home a horse and said it was mine. I rode him a handful of times - he was never broke, never trained - when I moved out, he stayed there. I have never had a place for him. I've told her repeatedly that I can't have him. I live in an apartment and I can't afford rent, let alone take care of a horse. She assured me he was taken care of. I've tried to help with money when I can, but I haven't felt like he's actually mine since I was a child. Hell, even then I didn't. 

A couple months ago my sister moved back in with my mom and saw the condition that ""my"" horse was in. She talked to my mom repeatedly about it and it always just turned into a fight. My mom blames me for the condition he's in. I haven't lived there in 12 years. I was told he was taken care of. I was never told otherwise. And when I did go out, he was out in the field with the other three horses munching hay. 
My sister got sick of the state the horse was in and called me. She set up a vet appointment for him, I used my financial aid to pay to have his teeth fixed and be scolded by the vet because this horse is extremely underweight and my mother made sure to tell them I was to blame. 

The vet was very close to calling the sheriff, and I don't blame him. This horse weighed 718 pounds, he should be between 900-1000. 900 is fine because he's old about 27 years old. 
So the problem is, I can't afford to send this horse somewhere else. I can't afford to pay for his special diet. But I know my mother won't take care of him. If I call the sheriff myself and tell them she's neglecting him, I'm worried she'll blame me and they'll side with her. 
I don't even know what I'm asking... 
I've contacted a rescue, but I don't know if they'll take him. 
I don't feel like he's mine, or like I should be held responsible since I haven't been a part of his life for half of it. 
I don't know what else to do... 


TL;DR : my mother claims the horse is mine but I haven't lived there in over 12 years, and she's neglecting him to near starvation. Am I legally responsible for him just because she says so? What can I do to help him?


Edit: I should have added that every time she's brought up him being a handful or ""too much trouble"" I've told her she should find him a new home and she always found a reason not to. But she had no problem selling my sisters horse because she took more than 2 days to find her a place to stay.",legaladvice,t3_djx79e

"MOLD in my apartment, I can’t get managements attention(California) 

So this story starts about a month ago when our bathroom sink just started flooding while we weren’t home (around 11:00pm). This was yellow/brown water and it got our entire bathroom floor and cabinets wet and our carpet soaking wet six feet out the bathroom door, and in our closet. 

Maintenance fixed the flooding issue and put a fan under our carpet (using our electricity) to dry everything up and a few days later someone came an glued the carpet back down. 

I sent them an email notifying them of a lingering odor and requesting a deep clean in our bathroom, a carpet cleaning, and some type of compensation for the loss of personal items, electricity use, and loss of use of our bathroom for the few days. 

Maintenance brought in an ozone machine for a whole day and we couldn’t be home while it was running. Well, they put this in the living room and it did absolutely nothing for the smell.  They were given access to our apartment numerous times and did not fix the smell, clean the carpets or clean the bathroom. 

I was having a hard time getting ahold of management through email so I went into the office and I was told they won’t be able to compensate me for anything. 

I kept pressuring them to fix the odor and shampoo the carpets and was actually lied to that the carpets had already been cleaned. 

Withholding my rent finally got their attention and the manager agreed to do an inspection. (This is a whole month later by the way)!

The night before the inspection I found a good amount of green and black mold in our closet. I let the manager know before he came for the inspection and that I was requesting to be relocated until it was dealt with. 

During the inspection (today), the mold was confirmed and they said they will be tearing out the dry wall and carpet padding for the next few days. They said relocation was NOT necessary. 

What do I do from here? I was breathing the mold for an entire month! And I’m still stuck here! The flooding was in no way caused by me or my actions. I just moved in 3 months ago.

"Grandmother passed away - Cousin, now executor of the will ignoring the entire rest of the family, what to do?Hi, apologies as this may be rather long but is something my family has been going through for the past 5 months or so.

Firstly a bit of backstory, my grandmother passed away in may this year, since then my cousin - now the executor of the will has ignored every single bit of correspondence from the family, including her own mother. I have personally messaged her a polite message when my grandmother passed away, asking for access to my grandmothers house. Reason being because she had ignored her mother, sisters, my fathers requests to be able to look at the house, go through her things, photos, memories etc that sort of thing. 

My father was in fact the previous executor of the will and estate, when both my grandparents were alive, (him and my grandfather were extremely close, dementia got the better of him unfortunately and he passed away in 2013). During the that stressful time in our lives my father looked after all of their bills, accounts, and their general finances. 

I believe my grandmother resented my father due to their close relationship and she often spoke ill of my him, and when money went missing (my grandad was a very proud man and a provider, so to keep him busy my dad would take him out, do general odd jobs with him which included taking my grandfather to the bank to get money out, due to the dementia he would often hide this around the house, and in due course my father was accused of stealing money. After my grandfathers passing my cousin all of a sudden started seeing my grandmother more regularly (nothing wrong with this) but since this point my grandmother started being more aggressive towards my father, accusing him of stealing the money, and telling the rest of our family that he was doing this. My cousin somehow got my grandmother to change my father being the executor of the will, and she is now the person with said responsibilities, after this point the will was then changed, she became the executor of the will and took control of my grandmothers finances, along with her girlfriend/partner (we believe she is very manipulative and controlling my cousin but that's another story). During this time my grandmothers will was also changed, but no-one knows what the details of said will are.

Previously the will stated that my father would received 50% of the estate, and my aunt - grandmothers daughter would receive the other 50%. My cousin had been telling all of the family that if my aunt were to pass, he would have received 100% of the will, which simply was not true, I have seen the will with my own eyes, it would have then passed down to my two cousins (her daughters, one of which is the point of this topic). They did believe this and for a long time all thought everything stated about my father was true. Having witnessing the will myself recently as we have a copy of the will as it was before it was then changed I know this not to be true.

Since the passing of my grandmother my cousin in question has ignored every single person (including her own mother) for the past 6 months, and will not share the will of my deceased grandmother with anyone. Instead she has blocked every means of contact with her. We believe she is waiting for the will to pass probate, which having looked generally takes around 6-9 months

A side note - after my grandfathers passing and the cousin took control of everything, checking with land registry my grandmothers house was re-evaluated in September of 2014. This so happens to be during the time my cousin started her IVF treatment, after speaking with my other cousin she did say that the cousin that is the point of this topic (her sister) was going through money troubles and has been for a while, and IVF is rather expensive, maybe a coincidence maybe not, I don't know.

All of the rest of the family are now close again, and are aware that my father wasn't guilty of doing any of the things he was accused of.

I am unsure what to do or how to proceed, in the UK a will goes into probate in generally 6-9 months, and as of yet that hasn't happened as I checked with the UK GOV website.

How can we proceed? If we have all been removed from the will, which we believe we have, is there anything we can do? I honestly believe my cousin has manipulated my grandmother into doing this but we have no-way of knowing if that is true.

Any advice would be much appreciated, and if there are any questions that need clearing up I will be happy to answer.

Thank you.",legaladvice,t3_djv9i5
"The roommate of my mother and I kicked me out, but not my mom. Her and I are now living somewhere else, but want to take legal action.I’m a minor in Colorado. I used to live in California with my mom (separates parents). 

We moved up to Colorado with our now former roommate. Him and my mom were friends, no romantic relationship whatsoever. 

So, about a year ago I got in an argument with the roommate, let’s call him Greg. Greg decided to take away an item of mine, and in return I took something of his. When he came back home from a dinner with his friends, he demanded that I gave it back or he called the cops. My mom got home around the same time as him and heard the arguing, and came into my room to speak to me alone, in which Greg left. 5-10 minutes later, Greg came upstairs telling us that the cops were called. The situation ended with him giving my item back and me returning his, no charges pressed on either end.

Recently, August to be exact, at the beginning of the month he decided to tell us that he’d be kicking us out and we have thirty days. Mind you, he is another tenant on the same lease as my mom; not the landlord / home owner. I do have a recording of the entire conversation because I felt like I would eventually be taking legal action on the situation, so if it went to court I do have evidence of this. I stated that it will most likely be over thirty days and he said fine. I knew that he can’t enforce it and I’m sure he knew. For future reference, Greg is 26 I am 17. 

The first week of September, I confronted Greg over Snapchat about how he was controlling and lying about the situation a year earlier (he told people I pulled a knife on him and my mom, but I never pursued defamation because I never lost money or reputation for it (I really don’t care what people think of me)).

The next day, after I left for work he went into my room and moved my belongings into the garage, and texted my mom that he’s installed cameras and that I am not allowed back on property. The same day I called CPS and they said that while they don’t know for sure, he should not be able to kick me out since he is not the landlord. Later that day my mom and I called for a police escort so that I could go and pick out some items I don’t want Greg touching (school supplies, phone equipment, vehicle title, etc.) 
(Also for clarification, my mom never signed an eviction notice and we were never presented one.)

My mother and I are currently living in our own place and have been out of contact with Greg since the incident. However recently there has been writing on our mail stating “evicted” when legally we were not, and it’s getting to the point he’s trying petty things to get us to contact him. 

In the same recording, I have him agreeing to allow my mom to use one of his spare vehicles until she gets her own so that she could get to and from work. Greg forced us to return it, even though he verbally agreed and it’s on recording; would I be able to charge him for the gas I used in my own vehicle to transport my mom? Would I be able to make him pay for a vehicle for us?

Sorry this post is all over the place, but here’s essentially what I’m asking: given all this information, does anyone believe I could take legal action against Greg and/or the landlord? If so, how would I get started? What’s the cheapest way of doing it since money is tight? My mother is aware of the post and will be answering questions along with me via this account if anyone needs more information, as long as it doesn’t ruin our anonymity.

EDIT: The landlord and roommate were friends, however nothing signed by either party allowed the roommate to have more power than anyone else paying rent (or me because I’m under my mom).",legaladvice,t3_djs6dm
"My dog bit a maintenance guy that let himself in unannounced.Los Angeles, CA

Short version: 

I got an email asking if it was okay to enter the day before. I didn’t see it or respond. Maintenance guy let himself in unannounced. My dog allegedly bit him. We pay pet rent. They’re kicking the dog out (and therefore us). Can they do that? Is they trespassing? Can they take further legal action against me?

Side note: they just spent 20k remediating  our apartment for mold that we had a private guy come and test the air for. 



Long version:

Yesterday a maintenance worker let himself into our  apartment without our consent. They emailed  the day before asking for permission to enter, which we didn’t see or respond to. When the worker came, I was in the other room so I don’t know if it’s true but they’re claiming that our dog bit the worker. 

They’re now saying we have until end of day Monday to “permanently remove the dog from the premises” or they will take “further legal action” against us. We are charged pet rent every month and the dog is part of our family so obviously the dog’s eviction is also our eviction. Our financial situation isn’t necessarily conducive to it at the moment, but we do want out of the apartment ASAP because of the mgmts recurring negligence even before this. 

Please advise what we should do. We have until end of day Monday. 


They didn’t send an official notice of intent to enter like they have done in the past when they aren’t asking if it’s okay. They have also asked in the past if we have dogs and if it’s ok to enter when we aren’t home. We have told them on multiple occasions that it’s not ok and we do have dogs. This is also not the first time they have entered without permission which they’ve apologized for in the past (in writing).

The dog has no history of violent behavior and is cool with all the people and dogs in the complex. 

Additionally, the maintenance guy was coming to replace our kitchen drawers that they removed over 3 weeks prior. 

Finally, aside from leaving us without kitchen drawers for over 3 weeks, there have been a lot of issues with the mgmt after the mold issue, including not repairing all damages caused during the time we were locked out of our apartment.

"[AZ] Contract changed from hourly to ""salary"" but nothing changed. If I work less then 36 hours I need to use PTO or I don't get paid full ""salary"".So I work for a company and recently my contract was changed from an hourly wage to salary.  Practically what this means is I no longer get overtime.  Am I really a salary employee, or are they just attempting to not pay OT?

Examples:

Old contract (hourly) - If I worked 32 hours, I got paid for 32 hours.  If I worked 50 hours, I got paid my base wage for the first 40 hours, then 1.5 x base wage for remaining 10.  

New contract (salary).  This contract explicitly states that salary is for 36 hours.  Any hours worked above 36 hours is paid at an hourly base wage, without overtime. If I work 32 hours I get paid for 32 hours though, not 36, and I am expected to use 4 hours of PTO to make up the difference in hours.  If I work 38 hours I get paid my salary plus 2 hours at my hourly base wage.  If I work 50 hours I get paid my salary plus 14 hours at my hourly base wage (without any overtime). 

The truthiness of it all is it seems like I'm still an hourly employee, especially since I need to use PTO or I don't get my full salary, and the company is just trying to get around not paying overtime.",legaladvice,t3_djryft
"Gave away old, shaky treadmill for free: New owner injured on it, and threatens to sueI gave away an old treadmill for FREE on Craigslist in California. It was squeaky and shaky, and had lost a large bolt that I didn't know where to put back. Sometimes when I was on it, I felt that it was about to fall apart.

2 months later, the person I gave it to says that the treadmill collapsed because of the missing bolt. He says he was injured in the process and is threatening to sue if I don't pay his medical bills which is about $800.

"Smelly wedding dresses of doomThis is such a weird Seinfeld-type situation but in all seriousness, I would greatly appreciate some advice.

So I have two wedding dresses that I decided to try and consign verses selling online (the thought of shipping a ball-gown type dress scared me). I brought them to a local wedding/vintage clothes shop in February of 2019. Signed paperwork stated that the items were still my property, I would earn a percentage of profits if sold, etc.

It's the third week of October and I called in to see if they sold-no dice. I figured eight or so months and no sell-it wasn't going to happen so I might as well try and sell them myself. Went in to pick up dresses. Not in original fabric bags but in some throw-away plastic ones but whatever. She lifted plastic up-dresses looked the same, all beading still on.

Signed some more paperwork stating that I picked the items up and went on my way.

I get home and take the dresses out of the bags.

They. Smell. Like bad mildew. You know that 'old' smell on vintage clothes? That punches you in the nostrils? Like ancient b.o and mold had a baby?

So now my issue is I have two stinky wedding dresses that no one in their right mind would buy. I can't just throw them in the wash and pray.  I was looking up dry cleaning prices in my area and due to all the intricate bead work the cost to clean them would be 400-500 each. (Located in Connecticut) 

What do I do guys? Do I send her a dry cleaning invoice and ask that she pay? I would hate to be a jerk and sue her but now I can't sell these dresses. This is a very small consignment shop and it does have that weird smell when you first walk in.

For reference they are two Alfred Angelo dresses. I don't have the receipts for them (foolish on my part) but I see what they are going for on Ebay etc.

"Employer not providing health insurance (USA, ND)To preface, I'm posting this for my (19F) boyfriend (20M). 

My boyfriend and I both work at Bed Bath and Beyond. For the past two months, my boyfriend has been working about 35 hours per week, plus some change because my boyfriend frequently has to stay later to finish projects. Since the beginning of the summer, management has been telling my boyfriend that he will be fulltime or receive a promotion that would make him fulltime, however when asked about the timeframe of this promotion, they avoid clear answers. 

My boyfriend does not have health insurance. According to what I read online, the ACA requires that companies with more than 50 full-time employees have to provide minimum health insurance to employees that work an average of 30 hours per week or 130 hours per month.

"[AUS] Gym took an extra $220 out of my account over the course of a couple months after I cancelled my membershipHello, I decided to go to gym sometime in May and choose a monthly payment plan. However after the two free trial weeks I decided to cancel it but I didn't get around to it on time to cancel it for free, so I had to pay for one extra month which I was okay with.
After this payment went through I figured that the membership was cancelled and didn't think about it afterwards. 

Two days ago however, I saw that some money had been transferred out of my account and saw that it was the gym. I quickly emailed them to inform them that they had taken some money out of my account that shouldn't have gone out as I had cancelled my membership. They emailed my back and asked for my BSB and Account number to refund me. I sent this to them. Then the day afterwards it occurred to me that it had been several months since I cancelled and I decided to look up to gym name in my bank account and multiple transactions came up. It totalled to 7 transactions, when only one was meant to be made. Also some times they transferred two payments out of my account within a week when it was only meant to be a monthly payment plan, thus taking double for a month when I wasn't even meant to be paying. I have since emailed an update to them to inform them that they have take more than just the one payment from me when they shouldn't have.

I am asking whether I should do anything else as each payment is $37.15 so totalling $222.9 that they took after I payed the first month when I cancelled.

"Mold in rental house - landlord says we should clean it up ourselvesI'm living in an older rental house in MN, USA and noticed mold growth in our bathroom and basement. I'm also having respiratory issues (like coughing, sneezing, major conjestion) that have been present since we moved in about 3 months ago. We contacted the property management company and it took them 3 weeks to even get back to us, even with us calling daily for the last week for updates. 

Now we've received a response and they essentially said this is a normal thing that isn't an issue. They won't even come out to the property to look at the visible mold growth and told us we should just clean it off the walls and ceilings ourselves. This doesn't seem safe to me since we're not professionals, we don't know what type of mold it is, and disturbing the mold could cause health issues if it's a more toxic variety.

I'm not really sure what to do at this point so my question is: is the property management company responsible for the clean up? Is this something they can tell us to clean up ourselves (by ""wiping down the walls and ceilings with bleach"")?

I'll also add that the basement water seal seems to be broken, which I'm assuming is a major contributing factor to the mold growth. Whenever we get any rain, water not only comes in through holes in the walls of the basement, but also seeps through the concrete blocks of the walls and bleeds down the walls onto the floor. We told the property management company about this as well but they said the house passed it's past inspection so it's fine.

"[Colorado] Tax filer has vanished with our documents; tax refund also never arrived.A tax preparer we hired to file our taxes for us has failed to acknowledge any of my family's dozen+ attempts to contact her since April. She claims she completed the filing. She has never provided us with the tax documents she filed on our behalf, however, and despite telling us that we qualified for a refund, we have never received a penny, nor any communication from the IRS about our tax status. You can see why we're suspicious. 

After six months of trying in vain to get this person to respond with answers about our taxes and refund, we've accepted that she's just not going to cooperate. We've kept a record of our efforts to contact her, and we have filed the IRS tax preparer misconduct form. 

These are my legal questions:

1. Is this a matter in which I would file a suit, or would I simply ask a lawyer to write a letter that insists she provide our documents to us?
2. She may have moved, and we don't know her current address; do lawyers have some ""Lawyer magic"" way of finding where she would be so they could send a letter to her, or would I also need to pay for a skip trace from a PI to acquire that information for a prospective lawyer?
3.

All of the other attorneys in town who practice landlord/tenant law also represent them. I live about 45 minutes away from Kansas City, but it is becoming clear that I will not be able to easily get a lawyer there because most of them are on the Missouri side and do not practice law in Kansas, and the ones who do seem to only represent landlords.

"Is it illegal to do a background check on someone and post the results in your apartment building?So. I moved into an apartment building awhile ago. I get along with my neighbors and made a few friends. My best friend David and I had a falling out. He thought I did something (I didn't do) that was very minor, even if I had done it. He responded by screaming swear words at me while literally running around the building. My response, since we were friends was nothing more than to wait for an apology and maybe an explanation.

Instead, what David did was to start telling all my neighbors I am a pedophile. Also, that I go into their apartments if they are unlocked, that I have been physically threatening David, etc. And this is just what I know he has been saying. Mostly though, he is trying to convince people I am a pedophile.

Another resident showed me something on his phone. It was a ""mugshot"" of David being arrested for an unmentioned ""sexual"" crime. The report said David was a ""sexual registrant"". There were a total of 5 different mugshots, from different arrests for a ""sexual"" or ""sex"" crime. 

Armed with this I did... nothing at all. I am not trying to hurt this guy, he is clearly mentally ill or something. I avoid him now as best I can and have gone on with my life. But... I found out yesterday from a new tenant that he is still telling people I am a pedophile.

So. I am angry. I was thinking about paying $50 to do a background check on this guy and, depending on the results posting them around my floor of the apartment. I probably won't do it, not once I calm down, but would I be in legal trouble if I did?",legaladvice,t3_dk3eho
"Ex-abusers wife is now the principal.3years ago my SO won a case against her former abuser and he was sentenced to 20 years. The former abuser was the principle of the private school she attended as well as an assistant pastor at the church that was conjoined with the school. She was also a resident of his household due to being placed there by CPS and lived there along with his family. Because of her living  there the abusers wife knew about the abuse and did not report it. The bishop of the church that the school was apart of also knew of the abuse and did nothing about it as well. Evidence and dialogue is part of the case against the abuser that shows those who knew and did nothing. The police records state that both parties knew of the abuse. Recently she has filed two separate civil lawsuits against the bishop/the wife and the abuser.

"Caught landlord on security camera going through my room taking photos of my belongingsHey,

I’m in Sydney Australia.
I have recently had many issues with my landlord who constantly makes up excuse to try and get into my home sub as “emergency inspections” when she found dog poo in the garden and said this was a emergency health risk.
I ended up leaving my camera on when I had a court date that she knew about, and I came back home early with my mother.
I found her standing in my backyard. I thought this was suspicious and went inside and noticed that my bathroom door was open and the mirror left open slightly. I always keep my bathroom door closed. I asked her if she had been inside my house and she turned her back to me and walked away.
I checked my security camera and she was caught going through my room taking photos of my personal belongings.

I’m moving out this weekend but she wants me to pay for repairs - such as replacing an entire plant because my dog broke one branch. 

Can I get compensation from her if I take this to tribunal for trespassing and making me move out because I felt so uncomfortable.",legaladvice,t3_djiz5b

He’s a sweet cat all around but loves to hunt and will defend himself. We’re in the suburbs, and I kind of assumed if you let your cat be an outdoor cat that’s the risk you take. They are threatening going to court. How am/am I liable for my cat having a fight with a neighbor cat? There is no history of aggression.

The $Y amount was included on the lease that we signed and the online portal to pay the rent. We signed and moved in during July.

We just got a message, 3 months after we moved in, from the management company that they “messed up” the lease and will be sending us a new lease for $X a month and that they will be collecting our “unpaid” rent from the months that we have been paying $Y.

"Would this be considered parental kidnapping?want to start this off by saying I'm using a throwaway account for this and I previously posted this to the wrong subreddit: My birth mother (as to not identify her I'll call her S) wasn't in a good state while pregnant with me (addiction and a lot of other stuff), so my grandmother was given full custody of me by the state of Ohio when I was born, and my uncle took care of me most of the time as my grandma got more and more older and frail. 

Now, when I was around 6-8 my uncle would take naps throughout the day and S would come to my house and would tell me to come along with her and to not wake my uncle and ask for permission first. I'd disappear for hours doing ""errands"" (walking with her to her drug dealers and prostitution clients) without him noticing and she'd bring me back before he could notice I was gone.

Eventually my grandmother passed and S and my uncle got shared custody (every other weekend or something she would get to spend a day or two with me) and she still continued this behavior, even on days she was not allowed to see me, and my uncle never found out. I'm now 17 and I had gotten reminded of this happening again and want to tell my uncle about it, but I'm not sure if it's of importance since I don't know, is this legally considered parental kidnapping?

"Ex-husband's crimes where I no longer have proofMy ex-husband, in addition to being emotionally and sexually abusive during our marriage, is a sick person. Before our split I found a flash drive with videos of us having sex that I was unaware were being taken for years, which was mortifying by itself in that I had no knowledge of them (this is relevant later). The issue I need advice on is that on that same flash drive there was footage of him setting up a camera in someone's home, specifically the bathroom, and recording the women who lived there. The footage was probably from around 9-10 years ago now. I confronted him on the disturbing content at the time and he said he had stashes of the sex videos of us on his phone that he would post online if I ever told anyone. Out of fear, I gave him the flash drive, which he destroyed in front of me and he said he erased the videos of us (I don't entirely believe this, which is part of my hesitation coming forward). My question is if anything that can be done? I spoke to my lawyer way back when the divorce proceedings started and she said typically people like him do not stop and in my gut I feel like he should not get away with this anymore and I feel strong enough now to stand up to him but I don't know what the options are, if there are any.

"How to protect neighborhoods from turning to rentals?In the recession, my smallish town in Idaho of about 40k people saw a housing crash, as did much of the U.S. What's followed is a large increase of single family homes turning to rentals. Add some gentrification, lax zoning laws, and voila- all the homes that do go for sale are luxury houses, while a modest 2 bedroom is a rental. When a smaller house does go for sale, cash investors snap it up before regular people can even say ""20 percent down.""

There's all this talk of a housing shortage, and building tiny houses for families...but no talk of how investment property domination is ruining neighborhoods. College kids are renting out craftsman bungalows and trashing them.

3 questions:
How hard is it to implement zoning laws to prevent further rentalfication?

"Emergency rooom visits in 2017 and 2019 - figured out hospital never billed for an old visit in 2017. They claim I owe them $1,500. (Atlanta, Georgia).Some back story, in 2017 - I had an emergency room visit at a local hospital (one of the largest hospitals in Atlanta). At intake, I presented them my ID and my health insurance card. They did some tests, prescribed me pain medication and that I was good to go.

Fast forward to last month, the hospital representative that was checking me out said that I had a previous balance from my previous emergency room visit ($1,500.00). My health insurance was never billed, so the cost was for the full amount of an emergency room visit (as if I didn't have any health insurance benefits). The address that they had on file for me was also incorrect - they had input the hospital's address, which was why I never received any billing information.

She also stated (in front of my boyfriend) that it was definitely the hospital's fault if my health insurance card was taken and was never billed. She stated it will be written off, that I no longer will need to pay the $1,500.00 bill and I needed to follow up a week later on the “status of this charge being written off” by calling the number on a billing document she handed to me.

Today, I had to go into Radiology department for scans and the representative let me know that there was still the $1,500.00 charge on my account. Strange, I had thought it was taken care of. I called the number on the back of the billing document labeled as ""Business Office"" and it leads me to a collection agency with a woman yelling over the phone, saying that she's here to collect the amount on my account. The collector states that she doesn't care what an ER representative had stated to me, she's just wants me to pay up. I hang up because the call gave me extreme anxiety.

I call the billing department for this hospital and talk to another crass woman over the phone, she has stated ""We don't have your insurance card on file for that 2017 visit. Why didn't you follow up when you didn't receive a bill from us? You owe us this amount and I can transfer you to our Financial Counseling team if you'd like a payment plan.""

I remember, very vividly that in 2017, on intake - I gave them my ID and my health insurance card. When they took my health insurance card, why didn't they scan it (like what the Billing Department had stated earlier, there was no health insurance card scanned)? Why didn't they have it on file? Why are they placing the blame on me when another representative stated it was the hospital's fault?

I don't think it's right that in 2017, I had insurance with United Healthcare and the hospital took my information (never scanned it / never billed it) upon intake and decides they want to collect it in 2019 because of their error.

"Washing machine exploded causing some property damage - manufacturer said they’ll cover everything but insurance is working on itBackground: washing machine exploded a week ago, causing some water damage to floors and wall in kitchen (located in closet in the kitchen). My kids and I were at the kitchen when it happened, no injuries besides a small cut in foot because of glass shards that went everywhere, and the big scare for the kids (both under 10). We have a camera in kitchen area so we caught explosion on camera.

We didn’t know what to do so we contacted manufacturer first. After going around, they assumed liability and said they cover everything. However, as they were going around we contacted our home insurance who started a claim and sent out a team to start the water remediation (drying), which is still going on. About 8 huge machines (fans/dehumidifiers) that run 24/7 in the kitchen, making it loud and unusable. Insurance also sent estimator, but won’t come back with estimates for another 1-2 weeks.

The challenge/question: we’re still in touch with manufacturer who would like to deal directly with us and get the machine for forensics. However, our insurance also wants the machine for forensics. Manufacturer said they can’t give us money if we go with insurance (they’ll pay to the insurance instead). Manufacturer said they were open to discuss some compensation for the distress, etc. I don’t think home insurance deals with that. So the question is whether we should continue with the insurance, or deal with manufacturer directly with the expectation that they’ll compensate us for more than just the minimum damage. We have in writing that they accept liability and will pay for it (but not in writing about other things). Anyone dealt with it before?


Update: manufacturer just called. The guy we’ve been talking to is flying in from corporate to see us this afternoon (they already had some technician who was going to come to look at the machine here but apparently they decided to fly the other guy here to accompany him). He also said the person we talked to about them not being able to pay us if we go through insurance didn’t know that this was being dealt at corporate level, so he said to disregard what she said.",legaladvice,t3_djr28b

"Kansas: Employer isn't paying employees because there's no money. Employees are missing 7-10 paychecksHello! I haven't posted to Reddit before so please forgive me if I mess up in terms of etiquette. 

I was employed for a **small start up chemical engineering company in Kansas** for 3 years, and during this time this company experienced a LOT of financial problems. I would regularly be delayed in receiving paychecks, and was missing up to 4 at one point. I've fortunately found a new job and I remain very good friends with my old coworkers, but they are now **missing between 7 and 10 paychecks (biweekly pay schedule).** The two coworkers missing 7 paychecks are classified as hourly employees (I was also hourly), and the four coworkers missing 10 paychecks are classified as salaried employees. Upper management is also considered salaried and **no one on upper management has received a paycheck since September of 2018.** 

My former company is holding on by the skin of its teeth and is extremely in debt--they got a sign posted to the front door saying they **owed over $40,000 in unpaid rent.** This bill was somehow paid, but it's just the tip of the iceberg--the company **owes massive amounts of money to vendors, the utilities have almost been shut off multiple times, etc.** The owners of the company are on site every day and one of them is also an engineer involved in day to day activities, but any money that has supported paychecks or business expenses has been coming from their personal money for months.

It would be easier if this was some ""fat cat"" scenario where a corrupt boss was pocketing everyone's earnings unjustly, but **there really is no money.**

I received my missing paychecks after quitting, but my former boss quit shortly after me and hasn't received ANY of his back pay. He was classified as upper management, so he last received a paycheck in September 2018. He's still technically employed by this company as a ""consultant,"" because he wanted to keep a connection with them to try and force them to pay him. The employees who remain there are in the process of finding new jobs, but it's been difficult to move on because everyone wanted to have faith that things would get better but it just hasn't worked out.  It's also been difficult because the work is very demanding on the few people that are still there. 

**Everyone is afraid that once they quit this company, they won't receive their missing paychecks.**

The company is already hugely in debt, so I worry that if the state department of labor is involved, the only consequence will be the company getting fined rather than any of my coworkers receiving the pay they rightfully earned. They're also concerned that there isn't a way to prove their time of employment if they don't have dated paychecks to show as proof.

**How do my former coworkers prove that they have been working for such an extended period of time without being paid?** 

**What should they be doing now in terms of documentation to compile relevant information in case this winds up going to court? SHOULD this be taken to court? Will court just put more of a financial burden on them?**

I’ve had these plans set months before they informed us of a date.  I’ve asked them to move the date and gave them windows of dates that I’ll be able to do this, they refused and asked me to “make arrangements”.  I was told I was making threats when I said I’m not sure what my rights are here and informed them that I should probably speak with a lawyer since I’m ignorant of my rights in this situation. What can I do, and what kind of lawyer if any should I consult? Thanks reddit!",legaladvice,t3_djru3p
"Adult brother has mental health issues. How can he grant us permission to handle his care?He wants help. He just has such severe social anxiety and OCD that he can’t handle making the appointments and advocating for himself. 

We can’t call the doctors and make appointments or advocate for him because he’s an adult. 

He wants to grant us permission to do that but we don’t know how. 

My first thought was medical power of attorney but I’m not sure. He’s not unconscious or technically unable to do this stuff so would a POA work?

Not sure what to do but he needs help, is willing to get help but doesn’t have the ability to follow through without our help and I want to get him well.

We call psychiatrists and they tell us he has to call. We aren’t looking to override his wishes just to help.",legaladvice,t3_djt68e

"Can a landlord impose a fine on a tenant?I live in a mobile home park in Texas, where the company in ownership of the property regularly sends notices to tenants regarding things like lot maintenance or warnings about eyesores. I recently received one such notice requesting me to ""remove weeds [from my lot] to avoid [a] $50 fine,"" as the notice phrased it. I intend to comply anyway, but I would like to know if the company can impose such a fine if I failed to remove my weeds.

Additionally, I'm referring to typical yard weeds. There are no illegal plants on my lot.

"Roommate is trying to prevent me from subleasing my room, do I have any options?So some background:
I'm a third year undergrad student, so I've started to look into internships and graduate schools. I recently started volunteering at a primate sanctuary to get my foot in the door for primate research, and I've absolutely loved it. 

Now the situation:
About a week ago, I received an email from the sanctuary asking if anyone would want to move onto the sanctuary grounds, rent free, in exchange for 10-15 volunteer hours each month. Obviously, I was ecstatic, and I immediately asked my roommate if she would be okay with me subleasing the apartment if all of the other details fell into place. She said that it would be okay as long as she was involved in the process. 

After meeting with the sanctuary manager to sort out some details, I checked again to make sure that my roommate was okay with the plan of subleasing, because I was planning on accepting the live-in position. This is when she suggested that my parents could continue paying my half of the rent (I am privilaged to have wonderful parents who cover many of my living expenses) if we were unable to find a subleaser. 

After talking with my parents, we decided that that could be an option, but only as a last resort since I would be increasing my other expenses by commuting to my classes. After this, I emailed the sanctuary to accept the position, and I also begin making posts to advertise the room. 

During this whole process, I made sure to check in with my roommate whenever I made a post to a new website, and she always agreed that it would be a good idea.

Fast forward to yesterday, I got a subleasing offer and I asked if my roommate would come with me to meet her. She said she would look at her schedule and get back to me.

Less than two hours later, she sent me a text saying that she is no longer comfortable with having a subleaser since she had ""signed the lease with me and not a stranger"" and had called our landlord.

According to him, my roommate would have to approve anyone that would move in (which is valid) but I checked the lease and I don't see anything that would require my roommate to approve a new tenant. While I do want her to approve of whoever would move in, am I missing a state law or local statute that would allow her to completely revoke my ability to sublease? (Portage county, WI) 

I do have a single message saved where she said that she was okay with me finding a subleaser, though I dont know how helpful that would be.",legaladvice,t3_djxd1h
"New and crazy neighborI live in a very rural area in Tennessee and just recently had a new “neighbor” move in (not neighbor as in next to me, he lives about 2 miles away on a neighboring road but for the sake of description i will call him a neighbor). This guy just moved in maybe a month ago at most and from the day he moved in he showed his displeasure with me when i would drive by on my way home from work by giving me nasty looks and hand gestures. Keep in mind he had just moved in and i had never spoken a word to him all i had done was given a friendly wave when i drove by only to be replied to with disgust. 

At the time i didnt think anything of it, i have some people around me that dont particularly like me because my truck is loud so i assumed maybe that was the case here, nevertheless, i continued to be friendly and wave everyday as im not one to specifically try to cause trouble. 

The next week i got married and was on my honeymoon so i wasnt in the area to be agitating him any further on whatever he was upset about. My first day back i was once again greeted with the disgust but he escalated to jumping up on his porch and screaming and cursing at me (like i said before my truck is a little noisy and only one window was down so i couldnt hear him). This continues for about a week each day getting progressively more hostile everyday that i drove by (busting through the front door, running out into his yard, and eventually running up next to the road while still screaming and cussing. Eventually i caught on that he was yelling at me to “slow down”  which was weird because i drive between 25-30 on that road out of respect for the people on that road because their houses are close to the road. To my knowledge in Tennessee unmarked rural roads are 45mph and if thats the case im already going well under the speed limit out of curtesy for their safety being so close to the road.

That catches you up to the begining of this week and the wraping up of this stupid delima im in. Monday started out with the usual busting through the door and running out to the middle of his yard yelling and cussing for me to slow down. Tuesday was an exact repeat from monday. Wednesday is when this guy decides to lose his crap. When i passed his house on wednesday he was waiting in his truck already started for me to go by. When i passed he pulled out behind me and proceeds to follow me down his road where i make a left thinking maybe he is just trying to be intimidating and scare me whatever i kept driving. He followed me for about a mile and a half to the dead end road i live on and blocks off the only entrance/exit to my farm. By this time i had already told my wife what was going on and was on the phone with my mom as she lives next to me and is much more legally smart than i am and i was asking her for advice and for her to call the police if this guy flipped his rocker and tried to attack me or something. After getting out of his truck and doing a few mins of yelling and cursing and flipping me off a few times he decides he still hasnt done enough and does a burnout chasing me up to my driveway and again blocks me in but this time he is on my 68 acres of private property. He then again gets out of his truck and did a repeat of what he did at the end of my road. He was on private property so under normal circumstances i wouldve confronted him and made him leave immediatley like i have with other “normal” trespassers many times before but this guy had me scared to even step away from my truck
1. He was prepared and waiting on me when i got out of work
2. He was clearly angry enough with whatever i did to stalk me back to my house and was acting hostile 
3. He would never take more than 2-3 steps away from his truck and left the door open
I had no idea if he had a weapon on him and didnt want to chance getting stabbed or shot at the end of my driveway with nothing to defend myself. I showed him i was on the phone with someone hoping he would think it was the police or something and he quickly hopped in his truck and peeled out.

"Issues with Uber's Anemic Cleaning Fee - Do I Have Any Recourse?The previous Saturday Morning (October 12, 2019), I had picked up a group of four people from a bar at one of the local strips in my town and took them on a 9.5 mile trip to their apartment complex on the northwest side.  In the last minutes of the trip, the passenger in the front seat suddenly began vomiting - they rolled down the window while I was on the freeway still and attempted to do it outside, but instead the slipstream blew it back in and scattered it all over the place.

That caused a passenger in the back seat to vomit as well.

I dropped the customer off at the designated end-of-trip location, signed off for the night, and immediately went to a well-lit gas station to take pictures of the damages.

There was vomit inside my car, outside of it, and in the window tracks and door seals.  There was even vomit in my front-seat cup holders.  This was no 'small' mess no matter how you dress it up.  It required extensive cleaning by a professional outfit, and this was going to COST.

The auto detailing place I went to charged me $300 for the job.  However, no matter how much documentation or photos I provide, Uber adamantly refuses to give anymore than their prescribe $150 flat-fee reimbursement, regardless of how severe the damage was.  The conversations I've been having with Driver Support have that tell-tale look of scripting because of the broken-record replies I've been getting.

I can provide pictures of the  mess, a picture of the receipt, pictures that shows a list of services that were done on my car, and screenshots of my conversation with Uber's Driver Support.

Uber's argument is that the $150 compensation is sufficient based on an averaging of cleaning costs sampled across the US, but that doesn't ring true to me as most detailing places I looked into want $150 ***just to start***.  Many Uber drivers agree - the $150 compensation is nowhere near enough, and I feel that this has gone on for long enough - if they want to treat us as Independent Contractors, then it's time they started actually dealing with us as such.  Because I don't know of any independent contractor in any field that would tolerate this kind of chicanery.

I told them it’s because I ran through a stop sign (I realized after I had passed it) and they did the typical license and registration. He then proceeded to ask about illegal substances being in the car and if if’s okay to search it.

They didn’t find anything except for marijuana, which is legal in Michigan (regardless I still didn’t know it was in there, it belongs to BF and GF) They still took it. After they found that they let us go and gave me a ticket for going through a stop sign. But the thing is, while I was the one driving, and my car is on the ticket, BF’s name is on the ticket.

"could this be considered harassmentThis is kind of a dumb story but it is a question I have that I thought someone from here might be able to help with. I was at Taco Bell with my girlfriend and it was our homecoming so she has on a dress not too short, but it’s kinda short. We sit down and I go to take a piss there was only one other table of people in there. When I get back my girlfriend tells me she has something she needs to tell me when the only other people in the Taco Bell leave. So I’m like ok that’s kinda weird. She tells me that when I had gotten up to go to the bathroom these people started chastising her about how short her dress was saying things like “if my daughter had on a dress like that I would beat her” “ does your father know what you are wearing”  “can that dress get any shorter” just repeated things like that. People were probably in their 30s we are only 16 it didn’t bother her too much, but this is where the story takes an unexpected turn. Just seconds after she gets done telling me I see them in their car pulling around Taco Bell so of course I fly them a bird. This grown ass man puts his car in reverse gets out and walks up to the window acting as if he wanted to fight me or something along the lines of that. Extremely immature grown ass man. After a few minutes of me just starring at him he walks off all smug. And drives away.

"Landlord changed assigned apartment without advance noticed - ColoradoIn August I signed a lease for an apartment in Colorado because I needed to leave my current apartment. Due to a change in circumstances, I chose to stay in my current apartment and wanted to have someone take over my lease on the new apartment that I had just signed for.

&amp;#x200B;

I told the leasing office at the new apartment that I wanted to find someone to take over my lease. They said they would help me and that I should also try to find someone to take over my lease, but that I would need to pay the rent in the meantime. I have paid the rent on time every month. I never took possession of the apartment and do not have keys to get into my unit but I continue to pay rent on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been trying to find someone to take over the new lease and have sent multiple people that have contacted me to them. I found out that they would take the people I sent to them and then have them take over someone else’s lease, as there were other people who were also trying to find others to take over their leases, and the leasing office maintained a list of units and would attempt to put anyone referred to them into those units as they saw fit.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I went to the leasing office in person for an update. They told me that they had moved me from the unit I had been assigned (a two bedroom &amp; two bathroom apartment with a shared common area that I would share with a stranger) and had instead placed me in a four bedroom apartment. They never notified me prior to this. The person I spoke to said that they would credit my account with $200 for each month I had paid since they had changed my unit to one that cost less money. (Renting a room in a four bedroom is cheaper than a two bedroom)

&amp;#x200B;

The lease specifically says: “The Landlord will make every attempt to assign the unit as listed, but reserves the right to change unit assignments.” And: “Landlord reserves the right, upon five days’ advance written notice to relocate Resident to another Apartment at the Community.” I was specifically assigned to the two bedroom unit and have a written message from the leasing office saying which unit I was assigned, but I was never notified in any way that I was moved from the two bedroom unit to the four bedroom unit. (Until I went in person and found out that they had moved me)

&amp;#x200B;

The lease has a standard severability clause.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, what legal recourse do I have here, if any? I have been trying to get out of the lease entirely; does anything here constitute a breach that would allow me to terminate the lease? If I am unable to use this as a reason to terminate the lease, do I have any remedy beyond the refund issued to my account for the money that they overcharged me? Do I have any remedy for the people I sent them being assigned to other units despite the fact that I found them specifically to take over my lease? If I do have recourse, is this something I would do in small claims court or would I need to go to a housing court? If housing court, would I need an attorney?",legaladvice,t3_djqj4s
"Update: ""Land manager's son threatening people and tampering with neighbors cars.""UPDATE:

Things are getting worse. I talked to my landlord and he didn't care very much. He didn't offer to help. I then called the police non-emergency line and filled them in on the incident. They said to call back if it happens again and took my name and their name down.

Today things got worse though. They appear to be angrier. My land managers older son, on probation, yelled at me across the yard ""Fuckin fink"" and some other some other stuff before his mom shut him up. He did a burnout down the road today and has generally been notably angry still. This guy just went to court for rape/assault and is still on probation.

What the hell do I do? I've never used the police for anything before. I don't want to make this worse. I wouldn't care about idle threats but everyone in this family has an assault record. I appreciate any advice. thank you

Eastern CT, USA. My apartment manager has issues with 7 out of 8 apartments and the landlord only visits once a year.

Things have been escalating recently and her 17 year old son has threatened 2 of us in different apartments. Both times it came out of no where and over nothing. Full on dead-eyes-rage mode. Last night i got to experience it first hand.

I stepped outside to grab the mail and the manager popped her head out to talk. She accused me of ""starting shit"" and that her 17 year old boy is very angry with me. She then called her son out of the house so he could talk to me. He was red face angry already and preceded to tell me to ""go to your car or go inside, go the fuck away"" He then said he was ""going to beat the shit out of you and take you down."" I said something like ""You're showing off in front of your mom, be quiet and dont threaten me"" I then walked away to try to get my cat inside and away from him. His mother had to drag him away because he was still going off.

I told them I was calling the police, but I never did. I'm thinking about making a report today though. I also feel like I should confront the landlord about this. At least 5-6 of my neighbors would definitely back me up. We have all had issues.

Also, just last week this young man had a very similar freakout on another neighbor. He was screaming and threatening violence.

"Owner of a business threatening legal action two years after a review was writtenHello everyone. This is kind of a long story, so I'll try to keep it brief.

In early 2017 I took my wedding dress to be altered at a local alterations place. They damaged my dress and were not willing to work with me to fix the issue, so I took it another location and they confirmed the dress was in bad shape. I ended up having to get another dress. My husband (fiancé at the time), my friend, and I all left negative reviews about the experience. My friend's was very harsh. After the reviews were posted, the owner began to text and call me to convince me to come in so he could make amends. After I agreed to meet with him, I took my review down and flagged my friends reviews and talked to my friend about them. My husband went with me to meet with the owner. The owner gave me many excuses and was not particularly friendly. He admitted that he was only concerned with his business and not my dress. My husband requested a full refund, and the owner agreed as long as we sign a note saying that we considered the matter closed. As we were leaving the owner asked if we'd take the reviews down. I explained that I already had, and had flagged my friend's reviews. My husband said he would not take his down.

The next day, the owner texted me saying that the police would be in touch and filed a police report against me for defamation and slander. I contacted a lawyer and documented everything that had happened with screenshots and such. The lawyer called the owner and informed him that any further contact from him would be considered harassment.

This week, over two years later, the owner sent a certified letter signed by a notary public saying that if all of the negative reviews are not taken down, he has the ""prerogative"" to take the issue to court for defamation. He demands a written response in 14 days. The envelope and body of the letter have my current address, which I just moved to a few months ago.

I am in the process of trying to contact my original lawyer, but what I really want to know is how worried should I actually be about any of this? I don't even have a review anywhere, just my husband. There are a lot of other negative reviews that have been written since 2017, at least one also mentions a police report being filed against them. He also has replied to many reviews and mentions things he has seen by looking through the reviewer's facebook. I wonder if he's targeting other people the way he is targeting me.",legaladvice,t3_djnexg
"Property and auto damage I'm a bit clueless, but here goes:
I purchased a brand new bike (motorcycle) a few weeks ago, and a few days ago a pizza guy ran it over, to the point where the front is warped, the kickstand bent, massive abrasion, tank damage, etc. (Shop guy already saying the dreaded t word)

 Well, the driver has the same insurance I do, and things are currently at a standstill due to ""coverage issues on their part"" as has been explained to me, and this has me worried. I also bought two separate maintenance and warranty covers for the bike, which now may be worthless. Unfortunately no Gap insurance. That being said, I if the driver will not be covered due to using his vehicle for work(I'm guessing), that leaves me and my full coverage.

 If the pizza place employed him, do they bear any of the fault? Is there any recourse for negligence causing me to be without my way to work? 

 And should I be worried that since we're both insured by the same provider, that I'm going to get a deal that serves them best?

"Domestic Violence MichiganI’m seeking advice for my significant other, not myself. I am not a party to the case. This will be long and I apologize for formatting. 


About two years ago my SO went to pick his kids up from his ex. They got into a heated argument over money (he is court ordered to pay child support and it is taken directly from his paycheck. This was her asking for money outside of that). Voices were raised and she shoved him out of her apartment. After he left, her boyfriend texted him threateningly as well. 


A neighbor called the police. She spoke with them and told them what happened, even admitting to putting her hands on him. 


The next time he went to take his kids back he called the police for an escort as he felt unsafe with her BF threatening him. The police told him they had been looking for him and asked to meet in a parking lot adjacent to her home. He met with them and gave his statement of facts. The police asked if wanted to press charges on her and he opted not to. They took his drivers license information and came with him to pick up the kids.  That was the last of that. Or so we thought. 


Yesterday he was on his way to pick the kids up from school and was pulled over. The cop had ran his plate and stopped him and when he asked why he was being stopped the cop asked if he knew he had a warrant. Of course not! The cop called the city of the warrant and those police came to pick him up. They arrested him, booked him and stuck him in a cell. 4 hours later they took him to see the judge where he was finally told why he had a warrant and was arrested. The city of his ex’s PD had filed charges of domestic violence against him and they had sent multiple notices to appear in court. He did not receive them. Why? Because they had made a clerical error. They had our correct street address but had entered that city and not ours on the documents. Remember they copied his license information. He did not falsify information. A quick google search would’ve shown it was a wrong address when they received several certified documents returned to sender in the mail. The judge wouldn’t let him speak to explain or question anything and his court appointed attorney basically told him it is what it is and there’s not much he can do about it. They gave him a new court date a month out and set him free with no bail/bond on his own recognizance. 


I went to the PD today (and was treated like a criminal myself just for walking in the door-what if I was a victim seeking help!?) to submit a FOIA request to get the original police report from two years ago to see just exactly what is in it because there was nothing that happened that would suggest he was the aggressor. We are trying to get legal aid as we cannot afford an attorney and we do not trust a court appointed one at this point. I feel like he’s being snowballed here for who knows what reason. He has no record of any kind. Not even driving infractions. He’s the chillest person I’ve ever known and just wouldn’t hit anyone. His ex is disturbed by these recent events even. She says she will testify the truth of what happened in court on his behalf. But since the city is pressing charges on her behalf I feel like they’ll just ignore her testimony. I wish I knew more about why they’re charging him. Can I get that information from the prosecutor or detective? 

Anyone have any suggestions on what a lawyer would do to save his butt in this case? We are freaking out over this. 

A side question: I asked the police clerk/dispatch/cop lady at the PD if since he was picked up on his warrant if it was cleared and he was safe from being picked up again and she said no not until he goes to court. So both our cars are in his name. So I can essentially be stopped by police on his warrant? I know I won’t go to jail but how can this be? He saw the judge. He sat in the cell. He was released. That should get rid of the warrant shouldn’t it?

"North Carolina - Accrued Vacation Payout Question1.  I resigned from my job last week and provided notice.  This was a voluntary termination.  I left because I found a better opportunity and the culture was poisonous.  Our group executive would often comment about how she hated children (I have 3; including one with special needs) and despised consultants (Most of my career prior to joining this bank was as a consultant).
2. On my last paycheck my employer said I only accrued 7 days of vacation in 2019 yet took 9 so they deducted 2 days from my final pay.  
3. When I followed up I was told I only was eligible for 10 days of vacation.  Based on my offer letter from August of 2018: ""Beginning January 1st of 2019, you will be  eligible for 20 days of vacation per year.""    Note- they gave me 5 days for the final quarter of 2018 which equates to 20 days over a full year. 
4. They justified the 10 days by saying that because I was placed on a performance plan in early 2019 they did not submit my name for corporate title approval to the board of directors (standard in banks) and vacation is tied to corporate title.
5. My poor performance during initial employment was due to severe depression and anxiety caused by a miserable divorce process.  I sought treatment by a mental health professional and through counseling and medication have successfully recovered.
6. I fulfilled the performance plan criteria by mid 2019 and was an employee in good standing and had been meeting performance expectations for months as of my resignation date.
7. Relevant fact:  Board meetings occur monthly.   There was no reason my corporate title could not have been submitted in 2019.  Upon speaking with some other people I have learned that this group was notorious for not submitting names in a timely manner.  Other employees had to raise issues in order to get their corporate titles approved. 
8. Relevant fact #2:   No where in my offer letter was my vacation tied to any ""conditions.""  I was also never informed that my vacation eligibility would be decreased from my 2018 accrual rate.

I believe they should be held to the 20 days of eligible vacation of which I accrued approximately 15 days.  This is a significant sum of money for me- I am short approximately $4000 if I am correct and they owe me for vacation accrued.

Questions- 

1.  Do I have a valid complaint?
2. How should I proceed with this given that my old manager isn't assisting?  This is a large bank.",legaladvice,t3_di8e23
