"Biomimicry lung cancer treatment proposalAs it is well known tobacco smoke is one of the main causes for lung cancer due to the many carcinogens it contains. Examples of these carcinogens are 10 different species of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), they are known to cause mutations in DNA when they are metabolized. 

Fortunately nature has developed a way to biodegrade these toxic compounds, several bacteria and fungi are able to degrade them through enzymes such as oxygenase, dehydrogenase and lignotyc enzimes. 

Therefore,  here goes my proposal in a very vague way...  What if we could design a drug with these enzymes that was able to degrade PAHs before the body started the metabolization?  Then through natural mechanisms such as secretory vesicles the residues of the degradation would be disposed of. 

I would appreciate any comments you have on the proposal!  :)",biology,t3_dl0vna

I'm not super passionate about biology but there are many aspects and subjects within it that interest me. I'm just not ready to fully commit my life to my job if that makes sense (go down a specific career path). At university I was miserable doing this stuff. I think the setting my university tends to bring upon is a reason for it and having a close group of friends had to do with it.

Also, are prions  considered living as well?

"What kind of non biology/lab jobs are there and how to get them? [full details in text]Hey everyone, i would just like to know what kind of non-biology related jobs i can get with my degree.

A little bit about me, i graduated from a 4 year public university a little over a year ago with a BS in biology and thanks to a family friend, i currently have a clinical/sales related job (field is definitely science related). However, this field is very niche, only a few thousand people in the USA probably do this job alone. The only 'skills' that carry over from this job to any general job would probably be people/sales skills. There will be a certain point in time where i will want to make a full career switch, even if it means switching fields completely. 

My question is, what kind of non biology/lab jobs can i get with my degree and current experience? How much is your past science job weighed when applying for jobs outside of this field? Ive seen people with music degrees working in insurance so there are jobs/companies that will take people that have a degree in general.

Thank you for give some attention to my post, I promise I'm going to be short.

Basically I'm a freshman in college in Italy ( Milan ) and I'm currently rolled in a course called CTF which, translated, means: chemistry and pharmaceutical thecnology. 
I always liked science in general, but my first choice was medicine, but I didn't get accepted.
I already skipped one year, for the same reason as I tried medicine and that course only and failed also.

This year, I decided to have a plan B so I looked over what my city could offer me and then I decided to apply to CTF and got in. 
I, of course, made some research before deciding which course I wanted to follow and this one seemed pretty legit. 

Unfortunately I now hear a lot of people saying that you don't get far with it, that I'll probably end up doing some sales stuff for any pharmaceutical company and that I won't work in any kind of synthesis lab. 
In my country and outside. 

Getting out and studying or working, eventually, abroad is not big deal, actually I like it. 
It's just scary for me to hear all these people, even ones that picked my same course saying these things. 

I'm now a little bit confused if I should pursue a career in biotechnology rather than this type of course.

"Info. for people who have/had asthmaI’m in my mid 20’s. Live a sedentary lifestyle (will change soon once I graduate in a couple months and can afford a gym membership). Had asthma when I was a kid, grew out of it. Used to play active sports, never really had a re-occurrence in my teens. But still experienced things in past years I’m just now finding out may be related, such as eczema, overproduction of mucus, tumors/cyst, heavy breathing, irregular heart beats.. 

I’ve been on a bit of a health craze in the last year or so, new hobby of sorts researching things and how they can be related to other stuff. 

[I found this article](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/291105.php), which basically glances over a recently new discovery of certain proteins that trigger ion channels,, in turn allowing chloride ions to pass into cell membranes. (If anyone could go over that in layman terms that’d be great)

I’m making this post w/ the intention of:

1. Answering some question I have (bullets listed below) 

2. For others to post any helpful information for living w/ asthma, tips basically

**Questions** (most are related to the article)

• *so does eating food w/ calcium worsen asthma effects.. or is it better ?*

• *is there a way to lower TMEM16A... or do you even want them lowered..?*

• *are their certain climates (temperate, humid, etc.) that make living w/ asthma harder.. is living in a cold climate worse?",biology,t3_djrepe

"This article from the cambridge university might perhaps have discovered a new theory of evolution which could completely disturb the world and could have huge social impacts.This will be very hard to even consider as a possible hypothesis but the Cambridge University released an article about the research made by DNA researchers  Maxim A. Makukov and Vladimir I. shCherbak. Those concluded after analysing a good part of our DNA that :

"" In our view, this fact alone is sufficient to seriously regard the codogram as a candidate bioSETI signature ""

Biological Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence signature.

Well their hypothesis claims that there are enough proofs in the way our DNA is constructed that might indicate that we have been engineered by an unknown form of intelligence which would have been able to concieve us by modifying the DNA of our ancestors.

Cambridge University only publishes articles only if researchers have degrees and are considered serious and competent.

"How and what kind of math is used in today's study of biology?Hey r/biology !

**Warning: This might turn out wordy.**

The question is in the title: How applicable is today's (American/Canadian) math curricula to the various fields of Biology?

For some context, I am taking an extra year in high school to finish up some graduation requirements. Due to previous mental health struggles, I lagged behind and unfortunately am cramming 70% of all math-related classes into this last year. These include Adv. Functions, Data &amp; Stats, as well as multiple Physics (for Uni/College admittance requirements). The thing is, I *really* struggle with math, and especially algebra-heavy and abstract-heavy concepts. I already dropped Calculus out of fear, and am dreading the coming semesters (currently struggling w/ advanced funcs). I have dropped my hope of ever entering into microbiology, genetics, or anything similar. (I should clarify that a research position is not an extremely desirable route, due to it's contract-like nature). I've gone from looking at various bachelors to hoping for a semi-interesting diploma that I can make a job out of (this might vary in the states, since I live in Canada). To be fair, some environmental sciences have looked appealing. However, to sum it up, I feel very hopeless due to the idea that so many fascinating doors are closing in a subject I love, just because I can't suck it up with some math concepts. 

So tell me, do I still have hope in a biology-related field, or do I sign out and find another passion?

"Animal Evolution; post zygotic isolation (mitochondrial/nuclear DNA) questionI wrote some notes in lecture (below)

Crosses show that the low fitness of hybrids between populations of the copepod is caused by a genetic mismatch between mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Maternally inherited mitochondria (circles) and nuclear chromosomes inherited from both parents (rods) of populations are coloured red and blue. 
.Crosses produce F1 hybrids with population A mitochondria. These F1 offspring have slightly higher survival showing hybrid vigor.
Crosses then produce F2 and F3, hybrids with recombined nuclear genes. 
The paternal backcross is produced by mating F3 females with population B males. These offspring have low fitness because the nuclear genes come from population B and are mismatched to the mitochondrial genes from population A.
In contrast, offspring of the maternal backcross in which most of the nuclear genes from the same population as the mitochondria have normal high survival.

I don't really understand what this means. If you reuse the female DNA over and over it will survive for the first generation but then it won't? Then when you match F3 generation with the original paternal it has low survivorship because its mismatched?",biology,t3_dio0h5

"Why do primates like their own appearance, and why do they seek out mates who have physical qualities similar to their own?I think it's well known that the ""opposites attract"" idea holds when it comes to mating between mammals, if not all animals. But why? 

Furthermore, why are primates (this is most noticeable in humans of course) partial towards their own appearance (people are more lenient/generous when rating their own appearance than when rating others). 

For the latter, I can imagine why: because people are built to like their childrens' appearances, as that'd make them (as parents) more likely to take care of their children and that leads to passing on your genes and all that. And obviously parents resemble their children. 

But why are we (on average) more attracted to those that look similar to us than to those that look different?

I was thinking about protein homology and how different amino acids can produce the same conformation. How is it possible? Is it because evolution conserves conformation rather than AA sequence?

We can choose one ribosomal protein (always the same) from E.coli, T. thermophilus, D. radiodurans etc. and we would see that homology of AA sequence can be below 60%, but that ribosomal protein has always the same conformation in each organism.

"Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2019: Simple Explanation of Discovery&amp;#x200B;

As a biologist learning about life processes is a ongoing process  because  questions arise from new discoveries. The newly discovered adaptive response of human body to varying levels of oxygen is exciting because it sheds light on how our body regulates and coordinates chemical reactions in response to changing environment. As you read this, your body is making adjustments to keep you in homeostasis.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Already Known:**

Low levels of oxygen increase production of EPO a hormone ( erythropoietin ). EPO increases production of red blood cells. More red blood cells increase potential of oxygen transport . But how dose varying levels of oxygen regulate this process?

**Discovered:**

HIF-1a (hypoxia inducible factor ) is a protein that binds to EPO gene depending on oxygen concentration level. ( Side note: binding to the gene of EPO modulates the expression of EPO gene thereby determining if it is expressed or not . In this case, when HIF-1a binds to EPO gene it changes the expression so more EPO is produced).  If oxygen concentration is high, low concentration of HIF-1a and if oxygen concentration is low, high concentration of HIF-1a. In other words, low oxygen concentration causes an increase in the production of EPO hormone as a result of HIF-1a regulation of EPO genome. What are the outcomes of this? EPO produces more RBC (red blood cells ) more RBC  more oxygen being delivered throughout the body. What happens when oxygen levels return to normal levels?  Another key player in the body's adaptive response to low oxygen levels is VHL gene. VHL degrades HIF-1a via prolyl hydroxylation ;  the process by which hydroxyl group is added to HIF-1a enabling VHL to recognize HIF-1a and degrading it .

But is it possible to identify a common gene that hasn't undergone such an event? Is there what I would call, 'the god gene' a truly original genetic unit that's survived since the origin of replicators?

"Identification of antigen by protein fractionation helpI'm just looking for advice if anyone has some.

I'm beginning to put together my first Biology PhD project with my advisor; he seems to be on board but I'm having a few doubts. The system we're working with can be summarized as follows:

- A large eukaryotic parasite infects the host (a freshwater fish) and, some of the time, the host has a specific reaction to the parasite's presence.
- It has been shown that the reaction will occur when the fish is injected with proteins extracted from the parasite, implying the mediator of the reaction (could be considered an antigen) is a protein

In order to identify or at least characterize this protein or proteins, we've been developing the following experiment:

- Fractionate protein slurry from parasite based on several characteristics (positively charged, negatively charged, size, hydrophobicity, etc.)
- Test each category by introducing protein fraction to fish and observing reaction (e.g. introduce one group of fish to all proteins under a certain size and another group to all proteins above that certain size). Assuming one group reacts and one doesn't, this will tell us a characteristic of the protein(s).
- After several fraction tests, extract only the proteins that share all traits with the protein of interest (e.g. if the negative, small, and hydrophobic groups of proteins triggered the reaction, then extract the proteins that are small and negative and hydrophobic) and use mass spectrometry to give putative identities of proteins to serve as candidates in future projects. 

My concern is this: will these proteins remain biologically active after subjecting them to, for example, anion exchange chromatography? Will denaturation or some other process get in the way of their triggering of the host reaction? Are there examples of this kind of project being done, or examples of alternative strategies?

"Need advice for fish experimental set upI am currently devising an experimental set up that requires a larval fish (~4mm long) to be adhered to the tip of a thin metal rod either on the dorsal or ventral side.

Now i'm thinking of a suitable glue or adhesive to adhere the fish to the rod. It would have to be adhered for up to 24 hours and for most parts it will be submerged in salt water. It must be able to cure on wet/moist surface. Right now, my best candidate is ethyl cyano acrylate (super glue) because it seems to have a fast curing process and inert in water.

"[enzyme kinetics] Effect of pH on Reaction Rates in Enzymes - Why is our curve parabolic?In my biology lab, we were studying the effect of pH on an enzyme's rate of reaction via spectrophotmetric measurments. When we graphed the data- pH on the x-axis, intial Velocity on the y-axis- the result was a (seemingly) parabolic curve with the vertex as the maximum. We used a spectrophotometer (wavelength=475nm), where the absorbance values were used to measure the concentration of our product with the help of Beer's law.

 I was wondering why the graph gave us a parabola looking shape? It was at a maximum in a slightly acidic solution (pH=7.2). The enzyme used was Tyrosinase, or oxygen oxyreductase.

"Angina: Stable vs UnstableI am pretty well-versed in angina thanks to my health anxiety that's caused me to read many articles explaining it. In a nutshell, it's pain or discomfort as a result of reduced blood flow to the heart and it can occur in your chest, abdomen, shoulder, back, etc, though it's worth noting that pain or discomfort in those areas is not necessarily angina.

Anyway, there's stable and unstable angina. Stable angina is the less severe version of the two and occurs during periods of exertion such as exercise or any activity that increases the heart's demand for oxygenated blood.

Then there's unstable angina which is identical to stable angina except that it can also occur while at rest. This type of angina is often considered a medical emergency as it could indicate that you're a candidate for a heart attack at any time.

So my question is this: If you have an arterial blockage significant enough to cause pain or discomfort while at rest on your couch or in bed, is it also possible to exert yourself through cardiovascular exercise and NOT trigger angina? If so, how does that work from a biological standpoint?

I ask because I am trying my best to diagnose my own chest pains. I've been to the ER around 14 times in the past year and a half over symptoms that mimic those associated to a heart attack or stroke, but all the blood work, EKGs, xrays, and even the CT scan, ultrasound, and nuclear stress test have all come back negative. Doctors -- including my own PCP -- have typically just chalked it up to anxiety or GERD and even told me a few times to stop going to the ER, but I need more reassurance.

Therefore, I am hoping that it's the case that, if you have a blockage bad enough to cause unstable angina, it will certainly also be triggered through cardiovascular exertion. Since I walk on my treadmill every day for an hour or longer at 2.5 mph and don't always experience chest pain, this would help set me a bit more at ease that it is indeed anxiety and not angina.

I have meniere's so i get extremely bad dizzy spells. i opted to have my vestibular system in both ears removed, but since the referral for surgery i accidentally came across a news article on SIDs saying how you need vestibular hair cells to be able to breathe during sleep. the scientist's name was Reubens and he said the hair cells in your vestibular part of the ear detect CO2 and tell your body to breathe and if both vestibulars in the ear are damaged, there will be no or very little response to CO2, and he said people with damaged vestibular hair cells could stop breathing in their sleep. this worried me a lot. the study was done on mice but a review said the experiment also damaged the mice's brains so i am unsure if it was damage to the brains causing the results of the study or chemical removal of their vestibular system.

a follow up paper said mice with damaged ears lost 60% of their respiratory drive to CO2, meaning 60% of the cells responsible for telling the body to breathe were gone.

"Measuring Rate of Reaction in Simple Potato/Hydrogen-Peroxide LabHi all. I'm currently working on a fairly major project, and am aiming to replicate a simple potato/h2o2 lab. Unlike most iterations of the lab, it is necessary to quantify the rate of enzyme activity rather than just noting that certain conditions are conducive to a higher reaction rate. The reaction of the catalase in the potato with the h2o2 will produce a bubbling type of foam. Would measuring the height of this foam be enough to accurately quantify the rate of enzyme activity?

The alternative would be a more complex arrangement where the oxygen produced by the reaction flows up from a [beaker through a tube into an water-filled upside-down graduated cylinder placed in a bucket of water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYokPRskjkI). At this point, I would measure the oxygen in the graduated cylinder.

"Question on Sexual Selection ESS and the CassowaryReading The Selfish Gene, Dawkins talks about Evolutionarily Stable Strategies and how they apply to sexual selection. He also talks about sexual competition and the asymmetry of gametes and investment in care and raising of offspring. This got me thinking about the Cassowary -  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary)

Male cassowaries  posses a territory and dig a nest within it (essentially a shallow impression in the ground) females enter a males territory, mate, lay eggs and move on to the next male's territory, sometimes laying eggs from the previous male (or a mix) in the nest of the next male. Each male then incubates the eggs and raises the young alone.

Is there other examples of male rearing where males establish fixed territories?

Is this the current explanation as to why male cassowaries incubate and rear young alone - because they have fixed territory to guard that grants them the ability to mate, and thus females can simply leave, while males are unable to leave as they would be abandoning both their offspring and their future opportunity to mate (surrendering territory)?

Does the fixed territory obtained and held by the males balance the imbalance of energy investment of their gametes?

EDIT: It just occurred to me that females don't incubate their young in a womb and thus have the additional opportunity to leave once the eggs are laid. This must also play a role in this case?",biology,t3_dfrc1u
"My bio chemistry professor dad sent me an explanation of how carcinogens cause cancer.So, the most distinguishing feature of cancers is uncontrolled cell division (we call it proliferation). Something is causing the cell to divide when the normal controls of cell growth would otherwise inhibit it. Typically there is a mutated gene which causes this.
 
There are basically 2 classes of cancer causing genes. One class of genes is always encouraging cell division and the other class is always inhibiting division (you can think of them as the accelerator and the brakes on cell division). Normally, these 2 controls work in tandem to give you just the right amount of cell division when it is appropriate. In order for a cell to divide uncontrollably, one of these 2 classes gets mutated. For example, if one of those “accelerator” genes gets mutated it could result in an overactive protein that hyper-accelerates the cell into doing division when not normally needed – in biology parlance we would say that a proto-oncogene has mutated into an oncogene. On the other hand, if one of those “braking” genes gets mutated then now you don’t have the controls in place that would normally stop the accelerators from over doing it – i.e. a “tumor suppressor gene” has lost its function.
 
So, carcinogens basically are chemicals that can mutate DNA in one of these 2 ways. There are many different types of proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, so there are many opportunities for mutations to lead to cancer. These mutations can happen naturally through copying mistakes or they can happen more frequently when exposed to carcinogens.
 
An interesting aside is why do people develop cancers as they age but they don’t develop things like cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia and other genetic diseases. The answer is that cancer can originate from a single cell! If one cell loses its controls it can divide excessively and eventually become a tumor. You can in fact develop mutations in single cells that are “cystic fibrosis” or whatever. But you don’t care if you have 1 cell in your body that has this disease as long as the other 30 trillion don’t.

"Question on the purpose MyosatinHeya! Biology enthusiast here with a question on the purposes and/or evolutionary advantages of myosatin in the bodies of animals.

I was doing some research on muscular dystrophy (Duchenne’s) and muscular hypertrophy. Myosatin regulates and slows myogenesis, the formation of muscle tissue. In muscular hypertrophy, the body produces very little myosatin, allowing muscles to grow quickly without much need for exercise. Myosatin inhibitors have been proposed as a way of combating muscular dystrophy, as well as degenerative bone conditions due to its inadvertent affect on bone density. 

My question is this; if a lack of myosatin has such a profound affect on our muscles, why do organisms produce so much of it anyway? Wouldn’t inhibiting the amount produced allow organisms to compete with the environment much better? Why did we evolve this way?

I described the patient’s strange symptoms first: the patient has been making totally transparent gummy feces since last Thursday. 2-3 times /day and 100 ml or so every time. His urination is normal (light yellow and normal frequencies). No other feces. Just little smell when the feces excreting. 

The patient is 60 year old. He has been in the bed more than two years and he is in half-comma that he cannot do anything by himself. He is fed with milk-like food. We care him well and his status looks good. Normal blood pressure (130/70 or so), normal pulse (80 or so), stable blood sugar (150 or so since he has diabetes). He can feel good and smile, or feel uncomfortable and shows unhappy face. 

He was diagnosed as Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infected months ago.  During the time, he had yellow-green loose feces with little colloidal substance. The smell was bad. 

He still looks good from his face. Sometimes smile. No yellow pupils. 

Any suggestions? We cannot understand where the food he ate gone.",biology,t3_dfowca

"I am planning to study molecular biology at university but I have my concernsI've been really interested in biology since 10th grade and I already decided that I want a career in biology. I personally find molecular biology to be the most attractive field of biology. However, I worry about two things, and would like to hear your answers to them:

\-I feel like it is too complex (and of course it is, but I mean literally incomprehensible), and worry about not understanding it at university. Whenever I try to learn topics related to molecular biology, I am always encountering confusing jargon, obscure representations etc., and I usually end up disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I understand fundamental processes well enough to know how they work, but not well enough to know how exactly they work. And I am a very detail-oriented person when it comes to such matters, so until I learn every detail of it and grasp it well, the concept feels blurred and this disturbs me. This is not to say that I expect our knowledge to be complete, I know it isn't, I know there are things that are still unknown to us and this fact alone excites me. Still, I want to be able to comprehend what we have at hand. Do you think I'll start to be able to comprehend the complexity of molecular biology once I start taking classes at university? 

\-Just judging from high school lectures, everything seems so theoretical and I honestly don't want that. I want to see the replication of DNA, the synthesis of proteins, cellular activities in action, I want to actually observe them rather than examine their representations. My teachers don't know much about how scientists designed the representations in the first place, and solely use representations while giving their lectures. Are lectures and concepts based mostly on theoretical grounds at university as well? What is your experience with experiments at university?",biology,t3_dfkke6

The mainstream scientific consensus states that there’s no major biological or psychological differences between human races despite over 50,000 years of geographical segregation “evolving” and adapting to completely opposite climates. 

The smartest non-human primate is an orangutan and they’re estimated to have a non-verbal intelligence of a 6 year old child and verbal intelligence a 1 year old.

(IQ = [chronological age / mental age] x 100). What environmental pressures in particular played a role in acquiring our primatological idiosyncrasies of creativity, consciousness, intelligence, and articulation?

Edit : Please don’t comment if you’re going to debate mathematics, semantics, and psychometrics with me - I get  intelligence is poorly defined, I get that you could make a solid case for an ant being smarter than us by using a subjective redefinition of intelligence, and I’m fully aware humans aren’t literally 18x verbally smarter than orangutans - I’m just making an approximated, generalized point about our OBJECTIVE intellectual superiority and unique psychological idiosyncrasies unfound anywhere else in the animal kingdom.",biology,t3_dfobbd

Wikipedia on disposable soma:

&gt;Formulated by Thomas Kirkwood, the disposable soma theory explains that an organism only has a limited amount of resources or ""soma"" that it can allocate to its various cellular processes.\[2\] Therefore, a greater investment in growth and reproduction would result in reduced investment in DNA repair maintenance, leading to increased cellular damage, shortened telomeres, accumulation of mutations, compromised stem cells, and ultimately, senescence.

"Lung compliance vs lung recoilI’m not sure if I’m going mad or my lecturer is misguided

They are trying to tell me that in conditions such as cystic fibrosis, that lungs can be both low compliant (I agree with this) and low recoil (this I’m struggling with). It’s my understanding that there is an inverse relationship between the two. I believe that the lung will be hard to explain, but will recoil back quickly, due to its stiffness. They say that as the elastin in the lungs has gone through fibrosis, and is therefore are hard to expand and also require additional work to retract. 

I can see their logic, but can’t find any clear evidence either way.  

Can anyone shed some light?  And if possible, point me in the right direction. Even a text book they know that discusses the relationship?

"How practical is UV (I guess likely UV-C) disinfection for quasi-routine use in a home?We have a side-loading washing machine that has a tendency to have mold growth on the seal for the door, a fairly dark mold.

There's also an orange-ish stain that forms in the tray where you load your liquid detergent, which I suspect is due to a mold; we had a similar orange stain form in the water bin for a dehumidifier we used to have, and it was rather difficult to get rid of, despite flooding the bin with clorox and letting it stand, then rinsing it out.

This continues to be an issue despite us leaving the door standing open and the tray pulled out when not in use, to allow it to dry more effectively and get more light.

*****

So I got to wondering how effective some sort of UV treatment might be at killing off whatever mold seems to be growing in there.  Is it feasible - and safe - to simply leave a UV bulb shining in the middle of the laundry room overnight while nobody is in there, then in the morning go in there with some sunglasses or stronger UV-blocking goggles and unplug the thing?

Is that overkill, or is it likely to be insufficient?  I know nothing about the real strength needed for germicidal purposes, or if the bulbs are weak enough that they need to be fairly close to the surface they're used to disinfect, so disinfecting a whole room at once is infeasible - inverse square law regarding light sources and all that.",biology,t3_debrz2

"Non-embryonic genetic modification**The Theory**

So basically, with the recent discovery of bacterial enzymes with the ability to alter the genome of a cell, it has become possible to adjust the DNA of an organism as an embryo. Once the person has grown, there is no possible way of making any genetic changes throughout the entire body. But what if you could?

One of the bacterial enzymes that were discovered was CRISPR, an enzyme with the ability to cut out and replace certain sections of DNA. So where I'm going with this is, if you take this enzyme and add an antigen to it, it could get to all of the cells that have the receptor for this antigen. In short, it’s basically an artificial retrovirus. Instead of harming the body though, it could be used to help the body. (I’ll refer to the CRISPR with the antigen attached to it as the Artificial Retro Virus or ARV )

**Cure for HIV**

As a retrovirus, HIV inserts its own DNA into the T-Helper cell. If the ARV is designed to identify the HIV DNA and replace it with the original T-Helper cell DNA that was lost, the T-Helper cell would be able to go back to functioning normally. There still might be HIV in the blood so another ARV could be sent into the T-Helper cell to take out the gene that codes for the HIV receptor and replace it with a different receptor that doesn’t allow for the HIV to enter the cell (the antigen won’t match the receptor anymore). In the end, as the T-Helper cells reproduce, they will create a generation of T-Helper cells that are HIV free and immune to the disease.

**Allergy Eradication**

If the ARV used to misshape the receptor could be used for HIV, it could also be used to misshape the receptors for any allergens someone may have. If the immune system can’t identify the allergen, there won’t be any reaction, which means the person is no longer allergic to that allergen.

**Viral and Bacteria Defense**

In an age where superbugs could send us back to a time where cold was lethal, the better solution would be to improve our cells, not our antibiotics. Using the misshaped receptor idea again, viruses and bacteria will no longer be able to enter the cell because their antigens will no longer match the receptors on the cell.

**Conclusion**

Using the potential tool of an ARV could get rid of many diseases and may bring about a generation of people who may never need to get another vaccine.

"Why does fluid output increase after drinking salt water?Looking at the homeostatic mechanism for increased osmolality (and also dehydration), the body increases ADH, which adds water pores in the nephron to increase water reabsorption. However with salt-water I've read that it causes dehydration through a higher net output (than input) of water from the body, thus water must be entering the nephron from the bloodstream. 
I'm just confused since this goes against the bodies response to high osmolality, which is to conserve water. Is the extremely high salt concentration just messing up the whole delicate balance of the kidneys?

"How to be a marine biologist WITHOUT ending up at SeaworldHello all, I am hoping I can get some help here. 

I am currently working on my undergraduate degree in biology, with a concentration in organismal biology/ecology. I really would like to study marine biology, but unfortunately my school does not offer it as a major, and I didn't have such a large interest for it until relatively recently. We offer 1 marine biology class that I do plan on taking, but ultimately I want to continue my education to receive a doctorate degree in the future. 

Here is my issue. I love marine biology and the ocean, and I also really love doing laboratory work. How would I go about trying to combine the two? The idea of doing field work is also intriguing. 

Another issue: the surplus of marine biologists, I would think, much outdoes the demand for them. I really would not want to end up working at Seaworld or an aquarium. I would ideally love to do research, I suppose I just don't know how to go about it.

"Why hasn’t Prions transferred from deer to humans yet like Mad Cow Disease?I live in Wisconsin where Chronic Wasting Disease is highly relevant amongst the southern counties. I’ve read articles of some Professor in Minnesota who warns that it can pass onto humans which then forms CJD in human brains like Mad Cow Disease. I hunt in a low percentage CWD deer county and I have concerns but don’t know what to believe. 

Apparently this is based on a Canadian Study where they infected monkeys similar to humans that were injected and fed Prions straight into their brains, into their blood veins through IV’s and also fed them infected meat and the monkeys got infected. But it’s was supposedly unpublished and un-replicated. Then the National Institutes of Health took cynomolgus macaques monkeys (primates closely related to humans) and exposed infected brain matter orally and cerebrally and after 13 years none were infected.

Now I’m not saying it can’t happen but does anyone know why this might be when we knew 10 years after Mad Cow Disease, in the mid 90’s, that people could get sick.


50 years of known Chronic Wasting Disease since the late 1960’s when it was first discovered, and having outbreaks in states like Wisconsin in early 2000’s (19 years ago) from which millions of pounds of probably infected venison has been consumed and not one reported case of CJD or outbreaks of CJD like in the United Kingdom, linking to a human from consumption of infected meat. I read that the county in Wisconsin with the highest infection rate amongst deer had got around 3,500 deer sent in for testing and almost 1/3rd of these deer had CWD. Also heard on a podcast from Joe Rogan that in these Wisconsin hot zones that 50% of mature bucks have it as well. According to Wisconsin DNR there were apparently 65,000 reported deer killed and tagged in that county and only 3,500 tested. How many people didn’t get deer tested and consumed infected meat???? Also note that was just one county where there are like 5-6 other counties with high infected rates. 

Anyone know what’s going on and how bad is this? I can’t tell if these articles about it are fear mongering articles, if they are serious scientific facts and studies, or if it’s hunters posting stuff cause their in denial something bad might be happening, or if this is a concern but only for deer populations and not humans?

"A student is seeking out urgent assistance from the fellow biology familyHi everyone,

I will just skip the introduction because I am very nervous.

&amp;#x200B;

The upcoming huge text well is nothing but a shout out from a student to the biology family to help out.

I have been trying to understand what I want to do with my life after I couldn't get enough grades to apply for the field of psychiatry.

After enrolling in the only program that only seemed interesting to me three years ago ""Agricultural Biotechnology"" I have realized I am drifting away from my goal, which is to help people over come the needs for psychiatric medicine by understanding and fixing the underlying micro-cause.

Luckily in one of the main departments in my program is Microbiology, While in one of the courses I tackled the subject ""Human Micro Biome"" It fascinated me, I started to get in love with Microbiology and Genetics.

Them combined I thought of why not understand the relation of human microbiome and human psychological health?

Here is where I am stuck,

I am currently in my third year, it is true iam in faculty of agriculture but we don't study Agriculture, We study biochemistry, Microbiology, Genetics in details. 

Now I am in Egypt so the English level of instructors and the content explanation/level isn't on pair to European or advanced countries elsewhere.

 One of the Professors I know which is one of the few highly educated ones that is barely seen in due to the amount of scholarships he get told me ""Learn to program, become Biotechnologist with an expertise in some bioinformatics"" 

Now I am aiming for scholarships and to actually make my self a valuable asset wherever I go,

1- What type of knowledge, topics and trends in Biotechnology I should have other than the basics of the 3 departments  mentioned above in order to be a valuable Bsc student who will be needed in scholarships and not just a burden to the scholarship application list. 

Note :  Iam already on it, regarding reading about the Microbiology basics and topics that focuses on the topic I am interested in.

No clue where to go in genetics, other than that the DNA is a helicase.... with few enzymes that does few processes.

Biochemistry Was taught by instructors that successfully made me hate the whole department and only with stand it to pass the subjects.

if possible where to get it online for free or what resources available in general ?

2- What type of knowledge do I need from Bioinformatics in order to confidentially say I can do programming to assist my ""Biology"" work, If possible where to get it online for free or what resources available in general ?

Note I have bought to Udemy courses when they were on 90% discount one that teaches python from A to Z, I thought about it because why would I limit my self to learn python just for the sake of biology work, I am still a student maybe I can do more !

I also bought another course for Data science using python on udemy as well. Finally I bought an advanced Excel course.

Now I got excited there for a minute spending months of saving to convert EGP to USD and buy them, till I read a discussion on one of the forums stating how absolutely useless it is to do what I have did, excel and python as a general language are useless for a biologist to focus on, rather than statical basics and python as a tool for research only !

That got me down so bad, Especially that I have no instructors I am all as you see jungling between forums seeking random kind people's assistance, which diverse ! as a student this gets frustrating and instructors in Egypt aren't interested in raising a student rather than getting a pre built knowledgeable one. 

3-What I am sure of right now is the following needs to be said/asked

1. I am 20
2. My time is running and in 2 years I will graduate.
3. I don't have any skills that would set me a part from the other 175 possible graduates from my university ""alone"" other than the GPA which is nothing to be proud of yet.
4. I can proudly speak English and I have learnt it on my own, through years of being mocked by gamers of how bad I am at it, now I work with it online and in call centers that hire from abroad. ""Which is nothing to be proud of but it gets me money to pay my university""
5.  I have No Idea where to start and what is required to be wanted in scholarships.
6. I am aiming for USA/UK/Canada/France for my scholarships.
7. I am preparing for my ielts and I am learning French on my own.
8. Should I refund the three courses I bought on Udemy ? they are by Jose portilla.
9. I am limited on time and money.

"What do you think of this is this considered intersex Here's a little bit about me.

My name is Nicole, I'm 33yrs old female only thing I know was I was born with a congenital diaphragm hernia which means that the right side stomach contents where pushed up into my lung cavity. I was also born 37 week premature and I was a SGA infant, The other thing I know of I have is digeorge syndrome and that is this 22q11.2 deletion syndrome is a chromosomal abnormality that can cause a wide range of health and developmental issues, including heart defects, breathing issues, problems with the gastrointestinal tract, immune and endocrine systems, differences in the palate, slow growth, autism/developmental delays or learning disabilities in some individuals.

When I was around the age of 18 I also started irregular periods they wouldn't start or anything like that and I started developing a different type of change down below I have this big bulge it don't hurt, no pain or anything not a hernia cause I go to gyn and get checked for those, and when I asked gyn about it they act like they don't even know I'm sure they don't honestly. So that was the first noticed both my parents have passed away and I'm the only one that knows about my discoveries and some close people that are near me, the bulge isn't all but when I noticed that when my mom was around I remembered asking her what is that? She said she don't know what it is and it's not because of being over weight cause I'm pretty much the same weight since high school.  

She said it in a snobby way at that also which threw me off she even told me that I had a hard time feeding when I was little, and I was always sick I know of that, and I had poor muscle tone. Moving on so not to long ago I decided to take pics of down below to see what is going on, I've noticed a lot of scar tissue I don't have no inner labia I have one big odd labia and i have no vagina lips. My clit is huge but it don't come out like a normal clit does I didn't even know I had one to be honest till I started dated a guy in my late 20's because of curiosity I'm mostly into woman, and then he said what is this long penis thing sticking out, and I said what are you talking about it is in a total different area then the clit should be.

To me they look like they buried it, and there is a cut mark on my clit I have no skin or none of the skin you would see down below it's all one big odd labia, and the closest thing I've came across was the CAH before and after surgery it really looks like mine to be honest, I've never had a chance to look at my medical records, but I do have them and all I know that I had electrolytes and imbalance hormones and they had to suction fluid out nose and mouth and my mom said they rushed me in the back which I find very interesting.  

They said on my one thing I have a hypoplastic labia majora when they looked me over, and someone else told me this is very odd when I was born they had to do a genetic test to see if I was female or male, and this is what it said.These findings are interpreted as being compatible with the karyotype of 46,XX Individual.The person told me that babies usually don't come home with that, they didn't know what I was I assumed but I don't think I have all my records to be honest because all mine talk about is hernia.My clit is really long and has a perfect head on it and it tries to go up when aroused but since they split it at the top which  I can see scars, it don't go far at all.

This is my first time here, and I usually don't go down deep wiki holes reading about biology, but it happened today, and I stumbled on a term I wasn't familiar with: Outbreeding Depression. That of course prompted the question in the title.

I couldn't find any good results through a quick google search. This seems to be a subject plagued by racism in the past (perhaps still in the present), and frankly there isn't much information.

I would be surprised if you could detect major outbreeding depression with humans, as our species doesn't seem as diverse as many others that inhabit our planet. We have the same shape, similar sizes and mass, organs, etc. There are differences in appearance and to a lesser extent physique, but is it enough to warrant it? I would imagine that people descendant from Eurasia and Africa wouldn't be *that* genetically diverse, as different groups/societies/civilizations have been in contact with each other for thousands of years as there are few natural barriers to limit contact. But could the same story be told for a say native of Australia or Ocenea who is 'genetically pure', and a native to the Americas? Or any groups of people that have been isolated for thousands of years.

if we do accidentally stumble upon  a carcinogenic DNA sequence and people insert it into  a retrovirus or just someone just decides to insert it into a nucleus of someones living cells....new weapons arise.

i believe in this life, if it can be done, people will be trying.

science usually presents an ideaa, engineers make that idea accessible for all and i think ,  DNA storage has a robust enough market, with big data which will morph into behemoth data to really improve the technology, we may see a moores law type improvement with the market consistently buying it, the way we create neural networks lends itself to slow read times anyway.as we don't really require  the images after we trained the neural net. so its something i could see really helping grow the space.

"What animals require continuous social groups to maintain survival vs which species could develop a healthy wild population solely through cloning?For the purposes of space colonization I am thinking about which species of animals could be cloned on arrival to a destination, vs which animals would need to have their social continuity preserved, and would need to at least partially be kept alive on the journey. I think most animals could be cloned from a diverse genetic pool for a new planet and develop wild populations without substantial hurdles. I'm assuming that cloning has advanced enough that it can be done without any genetic damage. But some species such as humans and elephants and dolphins and crows have complex behaviors that are likely social group based rather than instinctual, and would likely fail to manifest if the population arose solely from cloning. I am going to guess that only birds and mammals will require this. It's possible some animals from other such groups might require this too, but in my limited biological knowledge it doesn't seem likely. What animal groups do you think will require social groups to develop a population, and are any ones other than mammals and birds in this group? This is my provisional list

"Im starting biology / medicinal sciences degree this October and im scared shitless. (long post)Im starting the degree this october and im scared shitless. I didnt learn biology / chemistry / physics as school. I learnt like 7th-9th grade biology which is very very basic. I dont remember a thing.

chemistry i learnt at 9th grade - was one of the hardest, if not the hardest subject i have learnt. i am scared.

why did i choose biology then? well i did learn during 10th-12th grade Physical Education: No, we did not go outside to train or run; we sat in class and learnt physiology, anatomy, history of sports in my country, psychology in correlation to sports and athletes, sports in religions etc...

this is close to biology. not as in depth as biology but its a subject of life sciences (anatomy / physiology)

today I asked a masters degree in biology at the uni i am going to if I should still go for the degree, she sais yes, but in the month before the degree (meaning NOW) learn as much basic stuff using videos like  A-K LECTURE, CRASH COURSE, etc.... to get some basic info.

The degree will start from 0, but they will run at high speeds with the material.

Her suggesting me to start learning from videos prior to the beginning of the degree is for me to not have a hard impact when starting the degree. I will have nonetheless, but if I can decrease the impact, sure why not?

But im still scared shitless.

The reason I am saying this is to show that even an excelling, now masters degree, average 97 points student, got 60 in physics. \*SHE HERSELF told us to expect hard times and most likely low grades in maths and physics, as these are \[usually\] not the strong sides of biologists.

I graduated a few months ago from a University in Canada, Ontario. I got a degree in biology with a concentration in biodiversity and conservation but I think I'm really interested in microbiology. My grades were good enough to get my degree but not good enough to apply to a lot of schools in Ontario to do a masters if I wanted to.

I guess what I'm asking here is if anyone has graduated with a similar degree what did you end up doing with your life? I loved the structure of school, but by the end of my 4th year, it was really getting to me. It made me reconsider if I actually wanted to do a masters. 

Currently, I'm a lab technician at a medical laboratory. Everyone says its a great start for someone just outta school but I really hate it. Every day im just pushing samples through analyzers and checking if the results come through properly. It's an important job, I just don't like it. 

So long story short... I just graduated from University with a biology degree. I'm working a job at a lab that you can do with a non-specific college degree and I really feel like I'm not applying my education. I feel like I'm just floating and wasting my time.

I haven't been to university enough time to see the research environment and what degrees all the people that are involved got, but I think this could be true seeing how med students have better education. That's cause I seen how they get much more experience and specialization during their studies when students like me get very general knowledge which is hardly applicable in research and even an MSc couldn't easily give me equal ground. Also getting accepted to med school after my first degree is hardly a viable option because I'm studying in Greece where med students get their degree in 6 years and I get it in 4.

"What would it sound like if a creature had a syrinx structured like a hill myna's, but a mouth/tongue structure like a human and then tried to speak?I've been working on the design of a creature for a personal project, and I kinda wanted to make it's voice have a strange, unnatural and unique quality. I thought perhaps giving it a hill myna's syrinx and a flexible human tongue would let it be able to speak and form sounds, but it'd be an odd combination of all the specific sounds and vibrations possible from the syrinx combined with the tongue and mouth forming different shapes n' stuff.

I'm nowhere near an expert on this stuff, though. Everything I know and assume comes from what I've Googled, and I'd like a bit of advice/confirmation/info from someone who knows a lot about speech and syrinxes and all that.

Quick bit of info for those who aren't sure what a hill myna or a syrinx are:

A hill myna is a type of bird famous for its stunningly accurate mimicry and range of sounds. It accomplishes this with it's syrinx (the bird version of our voice box), which is designed a bit different from other birds'. It's got a wider gap between the bronchial rings on the membranes of it, so the bird has a wider range of vocabulary.

But if the host cell and endosymbiont were both prokaryotes, why is it that mitochondria have different ribosomes and chromosomes than the host cell?I understand that eukaryotic cells arose through a series of endosymbiotic events that involved prokaryotic cells acting as both host cells and endosymbionts. 

Mitochondria have their own ribosomes and chromosomes that differ from those of the host cell. However, if both the host cell and endosymbiont were prokaryotic, why would there be differences at all? Does this have anything to do with the eocyte tree?

Note: I have some ideas as I try to understand this, so please feel free to verbally punch me if I’m missing the mark. 
1. The prokaryotes acting as host cells were a different species than those that were engulfed: the host prokaryotes were anerobic, while the engulfed prokaryotes were able to detoxify the oxygen gas. 
2. Re: the eocyte tree: eukaryotes are more closely related to archaeans than bacteria, the latter being the prokaryotes that became the now-mitochondria.

I am a computer science student trying to build a classifier for splice site prediction as a hobby. 

For those of you that do not know about the problem:
Introns and exons got certain sequences at their boarders that mark a starting exon or intron. These sequences are fairly short with a length of 2. As there are quite a lot of random occurrences of these sequences in the DNA the task is now to classify whether an occurrence marks the beginning of an exon/intron or not. 

I know this problem is fairly old. 

Currently, I am trying to build the model on the physicochemical properties of the sequence ( properties of dinucleotides in the sequence) as an encoding, but it works kinda meh.

I should just start by saying I'm really struggling in school lately and not sure if this is the path I want to take anymore. I was always a straight-A student and the plan was always to continue on to grad school in chemical engineering. But the last year of school was awful due to mental health issues and this year isn't going any better. My grades have tanked and I'm finding it hard to be interested in chemistry anymore.

Now, with the fog inside, I was thinking of putting a tealight candle on top of the aluminum on one side, and ice cubes on the other side of the aquarium. My question is, would that be enough to make the fog move in a visible manner, enough to show that air pressure made by temperature differences makes the wind?",chemistry,t3_dkxng5

"For concentrations described as % v/v, does the solution include the volume of solute?Take for example this description:  [There are many ways to express the concentration of a solution. A bottle of wine has the label 13.1% (v/v). That means that 13.1 ml of alcohol are present in every 100 ml of wine.](http://www.dynamicscience.com.au/tester/solutions1/chemistry/solutions/concv-v.html) 

If I wanted to reduce this particular bottle of wine down to an alcohol content of 5% (v/v), I could try to remove (13.1 - 5 =) 8.1 mL of alcohol. However, now my entire solution is down to (100 - 8.1 =) 91.9 mL of wine. So I would actually be at 8.1 / 91.9 = 8.8 % (v/v) alcohol content. I would need to replace to ""lost"" 8.1 mL of alcohol with ""wine"" (what ever that wine liquid is), in order to end up with 5% (v/v) alcohol content.

DmTr protection of nucleosides usually has good regioselectivity for the 5' position.

Its obviously SN1 (teritaty electrophilic center, run with weak base, very stabilized caebocation). Wouldnt you expect no regioselectivity for primary over secondary alcohols in a SN1 ? I mean the whole name is about how the reaction is 0th order in nucleophile.

However, I also read that strong nucleophiles can be weak bases, which doesn’t make sense to me. I get that a smaller concentration of weak bases get protonated, therefore it’s a weak nucleophile. But how can there be a strong nucleophile yet it’s a weak base. If I remember correctly, the example given was the fluoride anion. Since it’s nucleus is highly electronegative, the anion has a hard time sharing its lone pairs, yet it can slightly be protonated.. because it’s so electronegative that the fluoride nucleus attracts the nucleus of electrophilic hydrogen?",chemistry,t3_dkj819

"Similtaneous electrodeposition of two metalsI’m currently reproducing/evaluating a bunch of electrodeposition methods for alpha source preparation, using only radiochemical tracers. The reason why is that I will need consistently near quantitative yields since I will eventually be working on a time series of samples collected since the 80s. To save time (since I need triplicates or more to have sufficient DOF for hypothesis testing) I’ve been doing simultaneous deposition of low (&lt;1 mBq) activities of ^(242)Pu and ^(243)Am, and using twice the activity of the latter to compensate somewhat for its 5 times higher specific activity (just in case there are some molarity related effects). 

The results for two very different methods are now in (with the third in the spectrometer as we speak). For both, there seems to be reasonably high yields of Pu, and consistently about 2 times lower Am yields relative to Pu. The reported yields for separate depositions were closer to 1:1.

To figure out how to interpret this data and what to do next, I’ve been searching the literature for effects of simultaneous electrodeposition on yields, and I’m not finding anything useful.

Thank you for give some attention to my post, I promise I'm going to be short.

Basically I'm a freshman in college in Italy ( Milan ) and I'm currently rolled in a course called CTF which, translated, means: chemistry and pharmaceutical thecnology. 
I always liked science in general, but my first choice was medicine, but I didn't get accepted.
I already skipped one year, for the same reason as I tried medicine and that course only and failed also.

This year, I decided to have a plan B so I looked over what my city could offer me and then I decided to apply to CTF and got in. 
I, of course, made some research before deciding which course I wanted to follow and this one seemed pretty legit. 

Unfortunately I now hear a lot of people saying that you don't get far with it, that I'll probably end up doing some sales stuff for any pharmaceutical company and that I won't work in any kind of synthesis lab. 
In my country and outside. 

Getting out and studying or working, eventually, abroad is not big deal, actually I like it. 
It's just scary for me to hear all these people, even ones that picked my same course saying these things. 

I'm now a little bit confused if I should pursue a career in biotechnology rather than this type of course.

Wondering if you could help me.
I'm not asking to pick a course for me.
I would like to know what are the job prospects for these two field, since I think I won't try again medicine next year.

"Soy Sauce Ate Holes and Reacted with Aluminum CanActually an aluminum bottle.  I saved the bottle since it seemed healthier to use than plastic and less prone to breaking than glass.  And I threw out the plastic bottle that the soy sauce came in because the soy sauce had hardened all around the cap.  Rather than rinse off the top and the cap and wash them, I just threw the whole bottle away and stored it in the aluminum bottle.  

Just went to use it, and noticed some little spots of blisters on the outside of the bottle.  Picked one off with my fingernail (it has a halfway solid, half slushy texture), and soy sauce started leaking out - I had just made a hole by picking off the blistering product of soy sauce mixed with an aluminum can.

I remember reading about ten years ago that aluminum isn't harmful to consume, as far as people knew then, but that it will stay in your system indefinitely (this was concerning aluminum in deoderants though, so I'm not sure how much carry-over there is).

I'm guessing steel would be even healthy to consume as the body needs iron, and steel is just iron + carbon?  Or does it form some kind of new molecule that the body would most likely not be able to break down into iron?",chemistry,t3_djjg3c

"Chemistry teachers (and teachers!) are important, and you should never underestimate itI talk to schools kids about careers in my area. Earlier this week at one school I talked about how my love for science helped me pick my career. A group of middle schoolers were amused and confused. They then asked if I could teach their chemistry class for them. At first I thought it was just a compliment, but then most of the group, which had been disengaged, started chiming in about how their chemistry teacher just writes up a bunch of facts on the board and quizzes them on it every day. ""He doesn't even teach us"". This is at a bottom 5% school and it broke my heart. I saw real passion and potential that wasn't being tended to. 

The silver lining is that my friend offered to tutor them, and the principal has been very receptive. Hopefully this takes off.

I'm also completely drowning under the amount of work because I'm constantly running into problems I haven't ever seen before, given that the sum total of my experience is 4 weeks.

"Can drying glassware with compressed air cause a hazardous buildup of static electricity?Odd question I know. I'll start with the story that led to me asking it:

A few summers ago I my co-op job had me work in a lab where we frequently performed reactions that required careful control of the amount of water added. To ensure the glassware was dry (and thus the only water present was what I added with a syringe), I would thoroughly blow-dry the glassware (a multineck flask, a stopper, and an adapter to connect it to the reflux condenser) with compressed air from a hose on the fume hood. This process was loud but otherwise seemingly without issue.

One day something weird happened: I was blow-drying the glassware as I usually do (I think but I'm not 100% sure it was the 'adapter' used to link the multineck flask to the condenser), when suddenly I next thing I know I am stumbling across the room, my ears are ringing, and my entire body feels very shaken up. The first thing that comes to my mind is *""Something exploded!""*, so still shaken I manage to stumble into the hallway and find my supervisor, to whom I explained what I felt. We re-entered the lab and found *absolutely nothing out of the ordinary*. And nobody on the team had been doing anything with pressure vessels. With no visible issues, we simply each resumed our own work.

I had long considered this a 'glitch in the matrix' type unsolved mystery, but recently I relayed the story to a relative. They suggested what I felt was an electric shock. I have little conscious experience with electric shocks, but aside from the ear ringing what little I remember is not dissimilar to what I felt that day in the lab. The question is where the shock came from, with the most obvious source being a static discharge caused by friction between the glassware and the compressed air that was blowing on it very hard.

So my question is: Is it at all realistic for a powerful stream of compressed air to cause enough of a buildup of static electricity in glassware that the discharge could thoroughly rattle and adult man? I don't worry about the actual shock being lethal, but we used that glassware for a reaction in Toluene and I hope I wasn't creating potential ignition sources by drying it.",chemistry,t3_diyx9w

Some of my clients will hold bottles for over a decade, but most hold at least 2-3 years.

"Deduction of van't Hoff equation for osmotic pressureI'm following the deduction of  van't Hoff equation for osmotic pressure in physical chemistry books and I'm lost in one math step, as follows:

From second law, we know that, at constant T, dμ = VmdP (where Vm is molar volume). So,

dμ = RTlnXa = VmdP

Considering that equilibrium is reached between pure solvent and solution, dμ = 0. Then,

dμ = RTlnXa = VmdP = 0

The next step I don't understand:

RTlnXa = -VmdP

Where is this '**minus**' coming from? It seems that one considers that x = y = 0, so one can state that x = -y.

Every incinerator seems to have very tight restrictions on incinerating mercury waste or doesn't want to at all.

All the mercury spill kits have unknown amounts of mercury. Often people put loads of sulphur in a jar with the contaminated solids, which means a toxic waste comes toxic and flammable with ultra high levels of sulphur so even less people want to incinerate it.

For the record, I'm not talking about Polyester epoxy resin...... more of a 2:1 ""water clear"" surfboard epoxy, for instance.

Most silicas tend to matte the surface and make the cured result more translucent than clear. So I thought about ""what's the stuff they use to thicken hair gel?"" which turned out to be Carbopol/Carbomer, a water based reaction polymer thickening additive.

"The applications of specific functional architectures in supramolecular chemistryI am having a little bit of trouble understanding the usefulness of different architectures in supramolecular chemistry - there are a number of different architectures that are essentially all inclusion complexes for guest species (cages, helicates, knots, boxes, etc.) - do they all have specific uses or do all these different architectures just assemble and we're just reporting the observation of them? Do any of these architectures convey specific and bespoke uses that make any one of them worth making (to carry out a specific function like cargo transportation) over another? For example, I know that helicates are chiral (given the fact that you can get right-handed or left-handed helices) and so that any cavity that forms in the centre of the helix elicits a chiral preference over prospective guests - would this ability to show enantioselectivity be a reason why a helical supramolecular system is chosen for a specific application over another?

"Life in Chemistry after undergrad.Hi Everyone,

I am currently a chemistry student completing my bachelors degree in New Zealand. I'm looking forward to moving on from undergraduate study into postgraduate research or even into the industry. I am interested to hear peoples stories; where they started and how they got to where they are today. I am a bit puzzled about what to do next in my journey. I believe that in order to get ahead in the world of Chemistry I have to continue into research, and I am happy to do so. I want to find out if research is for me. However, I've heard many people say different things when it comes to an honors versus a masters degree. Some say that a masters is more widely recognised, especially in Europe, (somewhere I can see myself working in the coming years) over an honors. However some people say that it does not really matter whether you have an honors or a masters, so long as you publish a paper or two along the way. 

Another enigma I have come across is what area of chemistry i would like to pursue. Most of my undergraduate laboratory experience has been in synthetic chemistry, both organic and inorganic. I love working in the synthetic labs however, the theory behind physical chemistry always intrigues me. I see synthetic chemistry as a more stable opportunity, with more job outcomes. However I am scared that I will get bored of the monotony of synthetic lab work and miss the excitement and curiosity of physical chemistry.

"Alcohol Dehydrogenase 

* The chemical name for alcohol is ethanol (CH3CH2OH). The body processes and eliminates ethanol in separate steps. Chemicals called enzymes help to break apart the ethanol molecule into other compounds (or metabolites), which can be processed more easily by the body. Some of these intermediate metabolites can have harmful effects on the body.
* Most of the ethanol in the body is broken down in the liver by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which transforms ethanol into a toxic compound called acetaldehyde (CH3CHO), a known carcinogen. However, acetaldehyde is generally short-lived; it is quickly broken down to a less toxic compound called acetate (CH3COO-) by another enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Acetate then is broken down to carbon dioxide and water, mainly in tissues other than the liver. 

*In other words, ADH and ALDH are enzymes that make it possible for humans to drink beer, wine, and other alcoholic beverages.*

* An isozyme of ADH is found more frequently in Asians than in whites, and an ALDH isozyme (ALDH2), although present in Asians, often is in an inactive form. The presence of an inactive form of ALDH2 is thought to be responsible for an increase in acetaldehyde levels in the body. Acetaldehyde is considered responsible for the facial flushing reaction often observed among Asians who have consumed alcohol. A dysphoric reaction to alcohol, producing uncomfortable sensations, is believed to be a response to deter further consumption.

So far I've been bullshitting my way through reducing the system potential before simulating my systems. The effects of small tricks and adjustments allowed me to circumvent this step I thought I could avoid forever.

However, I recently acquired beefier hardware to allow my simulator to use OpenCL, and started toying with bigger systems. The problem is, the potential energy is just too high now to simulate the systems ""as they are"".

&gt; *Note: in my simulator, a system is loaded from a non-standard MOLV2000 file with extra information for LJ/etc. interractions. A user-selected number of copies of the loaded system are then introduced at random coordinates within a cubic space.*

I need a way to lower the potential energy of my systems before simulating, but I am having trouble implementing fast and appropriate methods.

--------

My first attempt was brute-forcing the reduction: I made the simulator run a user-specified number of cycle, each cycle randomly displacing each atom within the universe. If the transformation increased the total system potential, it was discarded.

As it was extremely inneficient (though it did work) I then had the simulator displace each atom through a gradient-descent method. So basically, computing the force vector for each atom, and displacing them along this vector according to its magnitude, the atom's mass, and the provided timestep. Basically, motion without kinetic energy.

However, this gradient descent algorithm is unable to overcome potential wells, and the potential will often not be lowered beyond the depth of that well.

-----

IIRC, there is no method currently available to find the absolute minima of a function in multidimensional space, even if that space is finite.

"[2019/10/11] Synthetic Challenge #106**Intro**

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 106 of Synthetic Challenge!! This week it's my turn to host another inorganic synthesis challenge and this week the theme is - to be honest the theme is crazy things I liked the look of...

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

"Back in the day I took a gamble on a redox quiz in AP ChemWe had just learned about redox. The quiz in question had 5 redox reactions. In each reaction, a molecule was circled and we had to state whether it was the oxidizing agent or the reducing agent *and* whether the molecule itself was being reduced or being oxidized for a total of 10 points.

Now, I knew that the oxidizing agent always *gets* reduced, and that the reducing agent always *gets* oxidized. I also knew the chemistry of each reaction and I knew where the electrons were going.

Now here's where the gamble comes in: I couldn't remember if the oxidizing agent was the one that *gained* electrons or *lost* electrons. I had no clue. So, with time running out, I figured I could either put half of my answers one way and half the other way, ensuring me a 50% on the quiz. **Or** I could go all-in on one or the other and basically have a 50/50 shot of either getting a 100% or or 0%. As you already know from the title, I went all-in and went for it. I got a zero.

"Gills: Can dissolved oxygen be steered and liberated by electric charge from an anode in seawater?Here’s the idea:

In the ocean fish use gills to collect the dissolved oxygen that is in the seawater to essentially breath. I had an idea to possibly recreate that process but in a different manner. 


In the drawing there is a green line with half circles and a black line that is straight. There are blue arrows as well. The green line would represent an air permeable membrane that is also an anode. The air permeable membrane would not permit any water (or very little which could be later drained out) to pass through.  
The black line would be a non permeable surface and would be a cathode. The blue arrows represent the flow of water. 


The anode and cathode would only have a safe amount of current, not enough current for electrolysis or harm, yet enough to push (cathode) and pull (anode) the dissolved oxygen that’s present in the water. 


As the water flows between the two surfaces, the cathode’s positive charge pushes away the dissolved oxygen in the water whilst the anode pulls it toward its surface. While the water continues its flow, some of the dissolved oxygen gets trapped in the circular area and is harvested through the air permeable surface. 


Guessing an average figure of dissolved oxygen in seawater (it varies) I would guess if achieved a high rate of efficiency, it would take between 5 or more gallons of seawater to make a breath of air. A rebreather would be needed to increase efficiency. 


*Do not try at home I do not know if this idea is safe in this form and is only a primitive concept shared for informational purposes.

I'm standing over my soup. Mixing. Smelling. Wondering.

To what degree is saponification occurring in this soap? So I run through the entire process, and try to figure out any points in the cooking process that might have allowed for an alkaline environment with enough fat and salt available:

1. Boil water and two tablespoons of pork lard (soup)
2. Add one purple onion, one sweet yellow onion, and a whole head of garlic
3. Saute entire butternut squash until warm
4. Add two yellow onions to saute until entire saute is lightly to moderately blackened
5. Add saute to soup
6. Add six carrots to soup
7. Rub four pheasant legs in salt, pepper, cinnamon, mustard, and cayenne, with volumes decreasing in the list
8. Bake pheasant legs at 400°F until dark/until mustard smells strongly
9. Add pheasant to soup
10. Add potato flour, oregano, parsley, and thyme in decreasing volumes
11. Add a ton more salt, probably three tablespoons, and pepper probably two tablespoons
12. Start seeing lots of bubbles foaming at the top
13. Add 1L water
14. More tiny bubbles over time
15. Add apple cider vinegar
16. Bubbles start to dissipate

"Aqueous Samples in ATR-FTIR vs Aquaspec-FTIRHey guys,

I'm just getting into IRS, have no practical experience, so please bear with me. I have the following question: ATR-FTIR seems to be the extremely popular since it makes easy and fast analysis of samples which would usually overabsorb infrared radiation possible, the most important example being water. Quite an important step considering how many samples - especially in biology - cannot be properly separated from water. Now Buker - one of the most reputable seller of ATR-FTIR lab ware - also sells ""Aquaspec Transmission Cells"". Those are flow cells that are super narrow (7 µm) and can withstand a lot of pressure so normal FTIR of aqueous samples becomes possible.

"Tetrahedron Letters Template - Please Help!Has anyone ever used the Tetrahedron Letters template? Trying to start a perspective we were invited to do, but the template isn't working for me! 

Basically, they have a template with instructions, and at the end there is a button to click that removes the instructions and leaves you with a template to begin writing, while also creating a new ""instructions"" file to refer back to. 

Unfortunately the button doesn't work (it says if you mess with the template before pressing the button it can malfunction, but I keep re-downloading the template and heading straight for the button, no joy).

Weirdly, it says the file should be a .dot template file, but it's actually .doc. It also says the first thing to do is save the template (perhaps turning it into .dot), but the instructions for doing this make no sense to me based on my version of microsoft word. I have tried just using ""save as"" ""microsoft word template"" but the new .dotx or .dot file is the exact same. 

I'm most likely being really stupid here, so if anyone can help I would be very grateful!

"Potassium Chlorate CellHey guys, I’ve got a few questions about a potassium chlorate cell (from the electrolysis of potassium chloride) I wanna make.

1. I’ve ordered a couple titanium MMO electrodes online. Can I use these for both the cathode and the anode or should I find something else?

2. I was gonna neutralise the chlorine gas by bubbling it through distilled water, turning it into hydrochloric and hypochlorous acid. How much of the gaseous chlorine should this remove? I’m just gonna let the hydrogen float away cause it’s super light and not toxic.

"Activated water, is this a scam?Greetings r/chemistry. I apologize for the formatting as this is my first post.  


A close friend of mine invested his savings into this company selling ""Activated water"". I believe this is a scam, but I don't know enough to prove it.  
I only have basic school-level chemistry knowledge but alarms are going off left and right (if you aligned the water molucules, wouldn't it be solid? etc.) so I did some digging and it's becoming real fishy to say the least. But if I am wrong about this and it's actually real, I'd be putting people out of jobs.  


I honestly don't have enough chemistry knowledge to be certain, but what I'm certain about is I stand no chance against someone with a PhD, who's words I would be up against.

Here's a video regarding this activated wate and how it works  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g-0aERznyU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g-0aERznyU)

This is the company sites  
[http://gqusa.com/en/page/what-mret-water](http://gqusa.com/en/page/what-mret-water)

Here's a list of publications  
[http://www.healingwatertechnology.com/about.php](http://www.healingwatertechnology.com/about.php)

This is the chemist in question  
[http://www.sfileaw.com/html/dr\_\_smirnov.html](http://www.sfileaw.com/html/dr__smirnov.html)  


I really don't know how to go against someone that big. They even have a list of publications, got published in scientific journals? (They threw one of them at me saying it's nobel winning science, but I have no idea how to check it or read it) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237446023\_MRET\_Activated\_Water\_and\_its\_Succesful\_Application\_for\_Prevention\_Treatment\_and\_Enhanced\_Tumor\_Resistance\_in\_Oncology](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237446023_MRET_Activated_Water_and_its_Succesful_Application_for_Prevention_Treatment_and_Enhanced_Tumor_Resistance_in_Oncology)  


They also said the technology is also patented. Doesn't it have to actually work to get a patent?   


I've also found a court case that I found sickening, but I'm not a lawyer and don't know if these things are normal in courts [https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/7e1kw4/wtf\_is\_mret\_activated\_water\_please\_explain\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/7e1kw4/wtf_is_mret_activated_water_please_explain_in/) The worst page for me was page 16.  


My research pointed me to a thread here. [https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/7e1kw4/wtf\_is\_mret\_activated\_water\_please\_explain\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/7e1kw4/wtf_is_mret_activated_water_please_explain_in/)  
It was super useful in providing directions and things to look at, but I couldn't take ""everyone laughed at it"" and use it as an argument, if anything, it plays into their ""This is high level science and normal chemists won't understand it"" excuse

If not, is there a way to titrate without having to order phenylthylene(that stuff that turns pink lol). I'm trying to do this in the simplest most cost effective way.

I've tried having a conversation to explain why I'm not willing, but he brushed me off. I may be being sensitive, but I don't like lab partners who can't do their part. There was no evidence of even attempting.  Also for the first 2 labs I let him do the measurements and I asked him to measure the weight of the beaker so we could find the value of the substance poured into the beaker. He hasn't memorized Solubility rules and Molarity, he can't even convert properly.  In a precipitate experiment, I asked him to measure the weight of the beaker and this dude said yeah, but didn't, so I borrowed my friend's beaker data and thankfully made it.

"Using KCl in water softener in stead of NaCl - what are the benefits and disadvantages - does NaCl give you higher blood pressure?I've been told that using NaCl in your water softener will make your blood pressure much higher because the salt soaks into your  skin during hot showers.  I have a very difficult time believing this b/c if you are taking a 95-110F degree shower, you are going to be sweating during the shower, pushing fluids out of your pores. While this may enlarge your pores, there should be a positive pressure from inside the body pushing fluids out of the body and I suspect that it is very difficult for the NaCl to pass through the skin in any other way.  

As far as frequency and length, I'd estimate a 10min shower on average, every day, maybe a 15 min shower occasionally. I think it would be impossible for a person with healthy sodium levels to get into the range of dangerous sodium levels due to using NaCl in the water softener.  

The person I was ""arguing"" (fairly polite conversation) with said it HAS to pass through the skin b/c the various medications and patches you put on your skin allows the medicine to pass through and I told them there is often a solvent like DMSO added to these lotions/patches or some other solvent that allows it to pass through the skin easier - but there are some molecules that will pass through the skin (methylmercury anyone??) so a solvent isn't always required.  

I made the argument that if this was the case (showers increasing sodium levels) then people who are in the ocean every day for 3-8+ hours would  probably die from high blood pressure, and I was told that is totally different.  How - especially since ocean water has about 100,000x the salt as your home water.  But ocean water isn't 110 degrees. No but it can be 90-95 in places in  summer, so a 15-20 degree diff.  Not a major difference, especially with SO much more salt in the water.  

Now matter what I said they couldn't admit that the NaCl in the softened water wouldn't cause major increases in sodium levels.  

I was also wondering what advantages KCl would be in a softening system.  I'd think the only benefit would be if people were using grey water to fertilize gardens which could make use of the potassium ion to help plants grow.  Anything else, it seems like a waste IMO.",chemistry,t3_dfb26z

"How to define a baseline for a spectral analysis algorithmMy question is conceptual and quite general, so don't be scared off if you are unfamiliar with alpha spectrometry or R.

Due to only having access dated alpha spectrometry software for spectral analysis, I'm currently working on writing an R script to make my daily work easier. My script includes an algorithm to identify and ""integrate"" the peaks of two known analytes. Identifying peaks by eye or in silico requires a sense of where the baseline is, and I'm struggling with finding a definition that is universally applicable. Defining baselines for spectra of standards is easy as one can simply use the mean intensity of a known ""empty"" interval, but this obviously doesn't work for real samples due to the presence of other peaks. Of course I can manually define the baseline for every spectrum, but I would prefer avoiding that.

"KingDraw Tutorial 丨 Use of Ring Templates, Acyclic Tool, Snaking Tool  

Previously, we introduced the use of common chemical bonds that help us quickly draw common structural formulas.

In addition to these basic chemical bonds, KingDraw also provides a rich drawing template that allows us to easily draw more complex structures. Today, let's have a look at the use of ring templates, acyclic tool, and snaking tool.

**Ring Templates**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/qss7n330c9r31.png

**Draw Single Ring**

If you need to draw a ring structure separately, just select the template and click on the drawing board. Long press the direction of rotation to adjust the angle of the ring.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0ibxlhh1c9r31.gif

**Add it to existing structure**

Select any ring template and click on one end of the bond to create a ring that is connected to it. Press and hold to change the angle of the ring.

You can also click on the existing bond and add a new ring with the bond as one side.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/fmokyjm2c9r31.gif

Shortcut: Select any ring template and click the connection point of the middle in the structure to quickly draw a ring connected to the structure.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bzppwvj3c9r31.gif

**Acyclic Tool**

Acyclic Tool can draw multiple single bonds in succession.

Select \[Acyclic Tool\] and click on the artboard to form a long chain. By sliding up and down, you can change the display form of the long chain and the number of single bonds in the long chain.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/jv3qqyt4c9r31.jpg

The number on the long chain represents the number of C.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/9fynswr5c9r31.gif

**Snaking Tool**

The Snaking Tool can draw multiple single keys in sequence to form different rings.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/hkwrd7s6c9r31.jpg

Select the Snaking Tool. Click on the drawing board to adjust the direction and form a loop.

"DIY brass electroetching adviceRecently I've come across salt-water electroetching, and it seems really neat.

I'd like to give it a go, but I'm a little nervous about, say, accidentally gassing myself and/or blighting the land so that nothing ever grows again. So I thought I'd ask here!

Primarily I'm wondering about swapping out the electrolyte; instead of using just NaCl in water, I'd use either (a) a mix of NaCl and NaHCO3, (b) just NaHCO3, or (c) Citric Acid.

My thinking behind (a) is that the Bicarbonate will either electrolyse preferentially to the NaCl or will bind with the released chlorine before it can escape, but I'm a tad worried that it'll deplete locally rendering it pointless, thus (b) where I shouldn't get anything out except cool, refreshing CO2 albeit at the cost of electrical efficiency.

The Citric Acid is an independent idea, because I noticed it's actually used to clean brass, and apparently the copper it dissolves doesn't remain absorbed (?). I couldn't find any info on what this would actually do in practice, it's pure idle curiosity. I'm also wondering if using a Graphite Cathode to form a galvanic cell with the brass would be useful.

"I don't know whether I should tough out my lab jobI work at an environmental lab. I worked there last summer as an intern and it was a good experience. I got to learn a lot of different analyses and gained exposure to what it was like working in a fast paced environmental lab.

This spring I graduated from my university and I was offered a job as an analyst back at this lab and I took it. It is a private analytical lab and I get paid $16.75/hr. They promise quarterly raises + bonuses but they have not had those for four years. When I got to the lab, I was promised a pretty neat position however I was thrown everywhere for like the past four/five months to wherever they needed me so they could meet deadlines. It was really rough for me. Then my hours started becoming fairly long and I was doing 90+ hours in a two week period. Our lab is severely understaffed and our equipment is constantly breaking and the people are hard to be around. Also, pretty sure my lab is going against a lot of OSHA shit and it's just extremely unsafe. My lab looks absolutely decrepit.

I just feel really soul crushed at my job and I feel like I am really underpaid. I don't know whether to stick it out for the ""experience"" on my resume. The other thing is I want to go to graduate school but I am worried about my current student debt standings. I have roughly $30K in student loans to pay off. I was thinking of trying to leave my current lab job so I can pay off my student loans faster with a better paying job or save for graduate school. During this time at my job, I found out I really like microbiology. I was asked to learn micro when our microbiologist quit (we have lost a LOT of lab staff in the last year) and I learned I absolutely love it and now I am dreading giving the micro department back and going back to organics. I feel that getting to learn microbiology and having that position was purely luck and timing for me and there is no other way I could work in microbiology without going back to school. I am just stressed and kind of depressed about it all.

I just want to know if I should really stick this out. My work place has been really hard for me mentally and the hours just kind of suck for the pay. It feels like even when I work overtime my paychecks don't look that different or it's not even worth it. I feel very under appreciated. 

I really want to go back to school but I feel like there is no way any micro program would accept me or there is no way I could get a PhD without coming out in crippling debt. I got a B.A. in chemistry and a biology minor and graduated with a 3.2 gpa. I switched my major halfway through my undergraduate and was shooting for the B.S. but I really struggled with getting in all my classes so I just went for the B.A... I did almost everything for the B.S. except for two courses and the research. 

If anyone has advice on whether this lab experience is something I should stick out or if I even have a shot at graduate school, I would appreciate it. I am feeling really down and I don't know what to do. All I know is I don't want to work in an analytical environmental laboratory doing wet chemistry or organics.",chemistry,t3_ddo37n

"Measuring the pH of RO Water with a pH probeIonic strength of RO water I am testing is usually weak, about 50 uS/cm conductivity, which is problematic for measuring pH with an electrode. That conductivity was leading to drifting, mostly useless measurements. Looking for recommendations on how measure RO water a pH probe.

I need to measure the pH repetitively for product testing, so I'd prefer not to titrate each time, and pH paper usually only has low resolution, 0.5 pH max.

My though is to increase the ionic strength of the RO water to improve the pH measurements.

"Container for holding molten potassium hydroxideHello everyone!

I am currently in the process of trying to make potassium superoxide. My plan as of now to produce this is to electrolyze molten potassium hydroxide, and then oxidize it.

My current problem is what to contain the melted KOH with. I was looking into different materials for the container, and at first I settled on stainless steel. At the time I only had NaOH. At any rate, I decided to test a little on a stainless steel spoon. Upon melting it began reacting with the spoon, so I ruled out that. (I assume KOH would function in a similar fashion on stainless steel, however I have yet to test this). I then settled on Pyrex (borosilicate) glass. However, upon testing it as well, it also reacted, however it took much longer than the stainless steel.

I have yet to find info on this online. So my question is, what would be the best container for this?

Also, as of now, my electrodes are graphite. I understand Potassium with powdered graphite will form a Graphite Intercalation Compound. I currently am looking over this however, due to the fact that my electrodes are solid graphite, and thus my theory is that they should not form this (as potassium cannot then get in between layers of carbon), or will form very little. If anyone has any recommendations for relatively inexpensive electrodes, then that would be greatly appreciated as well.

Thank you!

Edit: Also if you're wondering why I don't just buy pure potassium, it's because for my project (making an oxygen regenerating canister), I need a lot more than is usually sold for a good time period of oxygen generation. Also in terms of simply buying potassium superoxide, I have yet to find it sold anywhere.",chemistry,t3_ddiloi
"Common sense is not so commonY'all, I had an interview for a job yesterday.This happens to me often, and I think it's part of my social anxiety.   During the interview the panel asked me a series of technical questions that progressively got harder.  Well two of the first questions, I could not for the life of me remember simple basic chemistry terms.   They asked me to describe how chromatography works.  I am now super hung up on the fact that I couldn't remember the terms mobile phase and stationary phase.  The second question was give three examples of how to separate organic material from a sample.  I gave the example of liquid liquid extraction and solid phase extraction but went blank for a third example.  Once again I think I was just making the question out to be more difficult than it actually is. :'(  This happened to me all throughout graduate school too.After we passed those two questions I was able to answer all the more complex questions in a breeze.

"Photoelectric Effect vs Ionizing Radiation?? And other things I want to know aboutHey y'all! 

I'm in a cool Chemistry Honors class in some high school in the US, and we just briefly went over the photoelectric effect! The first time I heard it, it sounded (at least from my limited knowledge) as a form of ionizing radiation. I scoured the internet but couldn't find anything touching on the subject/contrasting the two. 

They sound super similar, the photoelectric effect being the elevation of electrons to a higher energy level by light (emr), and ionizing radiation being the knocking off of electrons from compounds by super strong radiation. 

Bonus question! How does a solar sail work if photons have 0 mass and f = ma? My teach kind of just avoided my question haha.

As I said above, I recently switch to a chem major.  I worked in a research lab during my sophomore year, but it was a neurobiology lab.  I don't think I'll sufficient research experience to get into the more prestigious graduate progams by fall of next year.  Also, I plan on completing a thesis in the spring of my senior year as my course load is essentially empty that semester.  I feel like if I am going to commit such a large amount of my time to something I want put on my application/be able to discuss it in interviews.

Will taking a gap year hurt my application the following fall?

If I end up taking the gap year, I do not plan on using it to travel or just sit around and do nothing.  Ideally, I'd be able to continue my research or work on a new project at my university while working a full or part time job.

"Can anyone explain to me electron configuration in the easiest, most straightforward way there is? As if oyu were to explain it to a 12 years old child.Just some background:

Haven't learnt chemistry nor physicts nor biology.

Starting biology degree in a month so im starting to review some subjects from the start of chemistry to have atleast some knowledge when I start the degree.

So I get the basic idea: Electron configuration - in the most simple explanation - is where the electrons of a specific atom can be found in the space on the atom.

I get there are areas with weaker and bigger enegry, these are the shells.

I get there are weird areas where the electrons can be found - like the areas that look like the letters P/Z/D/F etc....

what I really want to know is:

1) Did I get the premise of electron configuration right? Is this the whole idea of it?

2) How do I use the periodic table to find out an atom's electrons configuraitons. 

I saw a graph with arrows which was pretty clear, but if I want to use the periodic table to figure out an atom's electron configuration, how do I do it in a simple way?",chemistry,t3_dcrixw

"Using fuels as cleanersHey.
My question is, can you / should you / is it a good idea to use gasoline and diesel to clean car parts primarily, but cleaning really any other dirty things (not food stuff obviously)? If yes, difference between diesel and gasoline and which to use in what situation, if there even is a real difference except the fact that diesel is more oily and leaves a film. Are they harmful to any materials? Metals, plastics or similar? If yes, to what? I have heard diesel and some plastics don't go too well. Would ethanol fuel work well? (I know it includes gasoline as well, but maybe higher ethanol content helps?) Do you have any other similar alternatives? Would maybe a mix of these two, or three work the best? Or would that make things worse?

I ask this because stuff that we use in workshops like brake cleaners and such seem to just be alcohol and some form of hydrocarbons and some aerosol things to carry it from what I understand from MSDS. Wouldn't gasoline be just as good since it is also basically the same stuff and also includes alcohol (ethanol) and is quite a lot cheaper compared to the ""commercial"" stuff. 
Another thing I hear a lot of people say about gasoline in particular is its dangerous and flammable, yes of course it is but isn't brake cleaner just as dangerous and flammable as gasoline except that it evaporates quicker? Not to mention the poisonous gas brake cleaner creates when heated up.

Another question on the same topic, I have seen oven cleaners do absolute ""magic"" in comparison to some more commonly used cleaning agents on parts, what about oven cleaner? How does this compare? Is it good, what to watch out for and such?

I have tried to answer these question by myself but all I find on car forums and such are a bunch of hear-says and wife's tales and people not really knowing the answer. A lot of answer also come from the fact that people think its just stupid using these stuff and trying them cause its unorthodox.

Because the solvent being run over the plant material in the extraction chamber is technically fresh every time it runs through...

Does it ultimately matter how much solvent I am using?

&amp;#x200B;

For example if I have 100g of plant material.

Does it matter if I use 200ml of solvent vs 500ml.

They will both extract the same % of compounds because it is fresh solvent condensing every time correct?

1. Are any stable for very long periods of time? Can they exist outside of solution? Are they very reactive?
2. What determines the number of ligands? Can concentration affect this, or would that simply affect the number of metal ions in a complex?",chemistry,t3_dbxofx

"Difference in programs for grad school?Hi, I often see professors ask to state why you feel a certain school suits you best. My question is basically this, exactly what is it that I'm supposed to see when finding that?

&amp;#x200B;

The only difference I can see in most US schools is the areas of research. And frankly, as an undergrad, I can mostly just understand the meaning of the broad areas at first glance. Reading papers do give me insight about the specifics, but is that all that is different among the different schools ?

"Senior Chem major feat. longterm mental health issues. Advice needed!I'm a BS Chem senior at a small, easy to get into, mostly unknown US college.  My GPA is 3.88/4.0.

To preface this, I definitely have undiagnosed mental illness, depression I'm sure. Probably some sort of personality disorder like avoidant personality as well. 

I majored in Chemistry because I always did pretty well in it. Well, now I'm looking at post grad options and realizing I don't know what to do. 

I haven't done any extracurriculars. No summer internships or research. Only regular jobs. I don't want to blame this on my school and its poor chem opportunities due to little enrollment, because I'm an adult, however I had an advisor for my first two years who was within the program and when I asked her about these things she said they didn't exist. I recently found out we do have small research opportunities in on campus labs. It's like there's no communication within the department. I'm also a transfer student, and I have a hard time being proactive. Anyway, so I have a good GPA but nothing else to round me out and make me desirable to grad schools, jobs, or internships. My depression and poor self esteem also gets in the way of me seizing opportunities. I feel like an impostor. I have met successful grads from my program, people who have phd from great institutions, those who are pursuing phd, people who go to great medical schools, etc. I just feel like I, despite my good grades and the fact that my professors like me, do not belong in the sciences and don't know jack squat about chemistry. 

Going back to the fact that I don't know what to do with chemistry. I don't want to become a doctor or pharmacist. My favorite part of chem used to be being in the lab. I guess it's still my favorite part. I thought that real world applications I'd be interested in are materials science, polymers, and formulation science. However when it comes to materials science, I'm kind of trash at pchem. I have been considering PhD but obviously I'd have to go to therapy before I even considered taking on that kind of stress. I already feel at the end of my rope every day in BS. It's also a long time to be in school. I don't know what to do... I could leave Chemistry but then I will feel as if my whole BS was a waste, and that I'm quitting just because I'm not confident. And realistically, until it's addressed, that lack of confidence will follow me to any other field/profession. As it followed me through middle and high school. 

So this is background. My questions are these: 

1. What would be a good way to become more competent and confident at BS level Chemistry on my own? Organic Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Physical Chemistry in particular? I have taken all courses (1 and 2) but I got through them by cramming/the grace of god and don't remember much about either of them. Especially PChem. I think depression and my anxious mental state also has caused my memory to go to hell. For the record, I am alright in all labs. I have broken glassware but not often, and I move through experiments kind of slowly, but I'm not godawful. 
2. How should I go about making myself more attractive to graduate programs or future employers? I graduate in May of this year. I have asked around and there isn't any research I can do at my university this semester. I think relying on my advisors for opportunities within the institution is out the window, to be honest. The faculty member who runs the most experiments acts like he'd rather use sophomores or graduate students. Most of the graduate research is outside of my field anyway. He just berates me for not having experience and then tells me he doesn't have any opportunities for me. Is it too late, and should I just find a lab to hire me for a year to make me a better candidate? 
3. I know this is different for everyone but if you were in my shoes right now, how would you figure out what you want to do with your BS Chemistry degree? I don't know what I like to do. Everything bums me out, sometimes even things I ""enjoy."" I feel like I have so many options and the loudest voice in my head is saying I'll fail at them all, but the second loudest voice is afraid of locking myself down a path I will end up hating. I wish I could find enjoyment in this field (or any field for that matter) that I have invested so much time and mental energy in.

"Why is LIQUID hydrogen so light/low-density?Liquid or Cryogenic Hydrogen for rockets has a very good energy density ***per gram*** compared to other common fuels like liquid methane or liquid kerosene. But the density of liquid hydrogen is really really low so the energy density **per litre of volume** is lower. This means hydrogen tanks need to be huge to contain enough fuel to get into orbit, like the external tank of the Space Shuttle and the relatively chubby looking Ariane 5. This is part of the reason some new designs are using Methane instead of Hydrogen - there's other factors involved in the decision but the low density is part of the equation.

My question is why?

If you ask why hydrogen **GAS** is so light/low-density it's because of the ideal gas laws and how 1 mole of a gas fills the same volume regardless of which gas it is therefore the gas with the smallest molecular mass will be lightest. But that's not why **LIQUID / Cryogenic** Hydrogen is so light / low density.

The hydrogen atom is very very small so logically it should be pretty easy to compress it down to a tiny size. If it was hydrogen ions I can see how that would be hard to compress because the charge density of a hydrogen + or - ion would be really high because it's so small, but that doesn't explain why the neutral atoms are hard to compress.

"Any DIY way to separate Aluminum Chloride from Iron (II) Chloride?Edit: made a typo on the title. I meant Iron (III) Chloride

–––––

Edit 2: I'm dumb. Ignore the question below. Rather than reacting aluminum with chlorhydric acid, I should react it with sodium hydroxide, which creates soluble sodium aluminate, precipitates the iron (II) hydroxide, and lets it oxidize into iron (III) hydroxide

Filter that out, then neutralize with hydrochloric acid until sodium ions are exhausted and aluminum hydroxide precipitates out

Filter again, treat filtrate with hydrochloric acid to obtain aluminum chloride, negligible iron contamination. Boom

Thanks to u/thicc_snek for the idea

I wanted to try my hand at making some aluminum soaps (mostly curious about the gel texture, to be honest), and I saw from patents that the most decent way was reacting sodium/potassium soap salts with aluminum chloride, as opposed to reacting it directly with aluminum hydroxide, which is pretty much insoluble


So I made some AlCl3, by reacting food grade aluminum foil with hydrochloric acid

Problem is, after filtering all the residual solids out, it appears to be contaminated with iron, if I am to go by the yellow tinge of the solution

Solid fuels are too messy for that kind of effect and I haven't actually looked at too many IRFNA rockets or other types of non-cryogenic rockets, so maybe they have it; but I tend to doubt it. The specific impulse of the F-1 engine is 263 seconds at sea level, which corresponds to exhaust gases moving at slightly over mach 7 at equilibrium.

My guess is that it has something to do with excited state lifetimes. Either there needs to be time for the reaction to occur before excitation can happen and exhaust is moving so fast that doesn't happen until slightly after it leaves the nozzle (which doesn't quite match up with how a rocket SHOULD work), or the molecules are excited in the nozzle and just moving so fast that even very short excited state lifetimes don't emit until several 10's of feet out of the nozzle. The real problem is that this only explains the lack of color and not the blackness observed. You should just be seeing blue sky or whatever before the orange flame. So, the easiest answer is something to do with index of refraction. You have a supersonic jet stream superheated to several thousand degrees C, it's probably bending light. However, even if it significantly bends the light, you should still see something, it just won't be whats directly behind it. Even if index of refraction changed enough to cause significant portions to reflect instead of bend, a 0 degree angle should still go through. If nothing else, even if my understanding of index of refraction sucks, the same general conditions (supersonic, superheated exhaust) are present in the RS-25 engine and it doesn't have the same dark area so that can't be the explanation. You could say it's just smoke but... they build it specifically to burn optimally and if you actually look at the exhaust, it's definitely not black. Add in that the operating temperature of these kinds of engines is high enough to require regenerative cooling (still several thousand C), which should be high enough to react just about anything, and the fact that the entire engine works by combusting in the nozzle and then expanding the reaction products and you see that A) it would be unlikely to only get partial combustion and B) it would be terribly inefficient if your main combustion process took place in the exhaust stream and not the nozzle. The steady state assumption would fall apart, too, but that's basically just another way of saying that the engine would really suck if it's main reaction took place outside the engine. 

So apparently something about burning specifically RP-1 blocks out the light. It could be incomplete combustion but I'm very unsure of that. I'm stumped. Anyone have any ideas?",chemistry,t3_dacmcb
"Best way to fabricate and characterize an OFET?Our group has recently acquired the equipment necessary to build up and characterize organic semiconductors through organic field-effect transistors. I've been trying to nail down a reliable method for fabricating high quality OFETs with high mobilities. The most difficult part, I've found, is probing the gate electrode, which is made of n-doped silicon. I've tried to scratch off the top layer of silicon dioxide to contact the n-doped silicon directly, but I've found it difficult to scratch the wafer without getting SiO2 dust all over the device. I've read that metallizing the gate by depositing gold on to the backside of the wafer is a viable method, but I'm not exactly sure how to probe the gate thereafter, and it seems like an unnecessary additional fabrication step. Does anybody have any tips for how they go about scratching off the SiO2 layer to probe the gate, or is back metallization a method that gives better transistor performance? If so, can you provide some tips for how to probe a device in this way?

EDIT: to be more specific, my lab group is mostly concerned with the synthesis of these materials, so we are not particular familiar with a lot of aspects of device engineering. We buy n-doped silicon wafers with 300 nm of thermally grown SiO2 on top. We then spincoat our organic semiconductor on top, thermally evaporate gold through a shadow mask on top as source and drain electrodes, and then the device is complete. In order to contact the n-doped silicon which is acting as the gate electrode, I mechanically remove the top layer by scratching a small corner with a titanium carbide tipped scribe. Mechanically scratching and metallizing the back  are the common ways that I know of for probing the gate in my field, but if there is an easier way or more reliable way, I'd love to learn about it.",chemistry,t3_dacl0w

Is this true or could possibly be true?  This was the redditor comment: ""Is nobody else here concerned about glycation? Honey has antibacterial properties, which might help acne, however it's mostly sugar. Ingesting sugar is really bad for skin because it increases glycation process (glucose binding to collagen and degrading it). I don't know if putting it on skin would have the same effect...

"Nearly blinded myself with some stupid backyard chemistry. What did I make?I did this when I was about 11 or 12 years old so it was quite a few years ago. Now that I'm older and wiser (I think) I was curious what kind of actual chemistry was going on. 

I got the bright idea from the internet of course, to put a brominated spa tablet into some isopropanol. My reaction vessel was an old ceramic mug. I dropped one tablet into about 50ml of iso, if remember right, and watched the the bromine leach out of the tablet. The reaction began to boil and the bromine started to fume off so I backed away and watched in awe. I decided to let it sit overnight before going back to clean up to ensure the reaction had completely finished. When I picked up the mug I saw some crystals had formed all up the sides of the mug. I leaned in for a closer look when I got a face full of some kind of gas which stung my eyes, throat and lungs horribly. I dropped the mug and ran away while having a massive coughing fit and tears streaming from my eyes. I couldn't open my eyes for about ten minutes and when I finally did my vision was blurry for about an hour.

Could anyone tell me what could have caused this? Were the crystals some kind of chlorinated salt that were giving off chlorine gas? Was there residual hydrogen bromide in the mug that somehow managed to stay in the mug over 12 hours later?

If you're wondering I'm fine now and after lasik I have 20/20 vision. And yes I was stupid enough to do the reaction again a few weeks later but I had thick gloves and a gas mask the second time and had no issues.",chemistry,t3_da0j9p

"extracted ion chromatographHello there, 
I recently read this term with relation to GCMS and im having hard time understanding whats going on there.

in TIC chromatogram, all ion peaks are observed which leads to mess  spectrum if there are many compounnds in the  mixture

in base peak chromatogram, only the tallest peak is observed which leads to cleaner spectra

in EIC the ion of interest is extracted from the data and then somehow put back in (wiki)

Wiki says

&gt;one or more m/z values representing one or more analytes of interest are recovered ('extracted') from the entire data set for a chromatographic run.[3] The total intensity or base peak intensity within a mass tolerance window around a particular analyte's mass-to-charge ratio is plotted at every point in the analysis.

but what I dont understand is how it works in layman terms (im synthetic chem, not analytical) or especialy, if you are analyzing complex mixture (like urine sample) how do you set up the m/z values to be extracted when you dont know what is in the sample?

"Atomic Radii Vs Ion Radii trend questionHello everybody, this is a very basic concept for chemistry, but I can’t like understand exactly why it is the way it is. So basically I don’t quite understand why ionizing an atom changes the radius so much more drastically than periodic trends for atomic Radii alone.

Here’s where I start to get confused...my textbook explains that going left to right decreases radius because although the atom is gaining more electrons (valence), the atom is also gaining a proton and thus increases the effective nuclear charge on the valence electrons, since the valence electrons are terrible at shielding each other. Basically, I completely understand that valence electrons don’t contribute to the overall effective nuclear charge, so you’re adding a proton, and the higher charge pulls more strongly on the valence electrons! Perfect sense!

Here’s where I’m confused...why would removing a single valence electron from a multi-valence electron atom greatly reduce its size? Like, the effective nuclear charge shouldn’t change, because you’re removing a valence electron. It isn’t like you’re changing the amount of charge experienced by the valence electrons based on the same logic used to explain why atoms decrease in size periodically from left to right...the only case I understand is ionizing an atom with noble gas configuration into an anion (somehow) and ionizing an atom with one valence into a cation. You’re moving onto a new principle energy level, I get why this makes the atom so much larger/smaller (you’re moving to a new energy level with an extra/one less proton than you would have), but not for atoms with 2-7 valence electrons. You aren’t changing the effective nuclear charge by removing a single valence electron right? Wouldn’t the pull be identical? Or very close? Am I overthinking this?",chemistry,t3_d9zmny

"This professor have a very nice way of demonstrating how can you estimate the size of the atomic nucleus with the thin gold foil experiment by asking students to throw ping pong balls and count how many hits they gotNot a direct link to give some background.

The video of the lecture is [this one here](https://youtu.be/l-BNoAPe6qo?t=2420). At around 40m20s the ""experiment"" begins and the students start throwing their ping pong balls, paying attention if their respective balls hit the grid or not.

Earlier she explains that if you know the size of an atomic nucleus orderly distributed in an array (atoms of Au, for example) and you hit it with a beam of alpha particles, then you will have a distribution of particles that will scatter and some that will not. She deduces that the probability will depend on the size of the nucleus, and also the existence of a dense nucleus itself, which was the main outcome of the Geiger–Marsden experiment. And she also shows that if you have the distribution and you calculate it backwards, you can estimate the size of the nucleus.

So the demonstration she proposes on this lecture was to ask students to throw balls at a grid of other balls (representing the nucleus) suspended by strings and then she counts how many hits and misses the students got. From that ratio she was able to calculate the size of the ""nucleus"". They got pretty close to the actual value (just 8% more)

I remember watching this video a while ago and thought to myself this was a very neat and fun way to explain this experiment!

"[2019/09/25] Synthetic Relay #17Hello everyone! Welcome back to Week 17 of Synthetic Relay!!

New updates for Synthetic Challenge/Relay, we have a subreddit! Check us out at [r/SyntheticChallenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyntheticChallenge/)!!!

This week the molecule to start the relay with [alpha-D-glucose](https://i.imgur.com/CknAGIh.png)

**RULES**

1. For each user in the relay, they can post **once every 3 posts**
2. Upper limit of **10 carbons** for every relay segment
3. Please explain your reaction by:

a) Providing a mechanism OR

b) Referencing publications OR

c) If you are uncertain, make a note that you require verification and another relay member can verify you reaction by providing the above information.

4) **Please provide the ChemDraw (.cdx) file if you draw your molecule with ChemDraw;** if you don't have ChemDraw, that is okay you can continue the relay without providing the ChemDraw file. It is a way for other's to have an easier time with the relay process.

5) No polymers unless you justify your reasoning.

Thank you all for participating in the relay challenges, and if you have suggestions on the Synthetic Relay series, please let me know anytime! Thank you for all the support!",chemistry,t3_d9ckrr
"Can I start studying Introductory Chemistry with limited math skills?I'm looking to start an Elementary Chemistry for Health Sciences course in three months to get into nursing school. Apparently it dabbles in not only general chemistry, but also a bit of organic and biological chemistry. I attended high school in South Korea where chemistry and biology is not a required course, so I have absolutely zero experience in chemistry.

I was so ready to dive into introductory chemistry on Khan Academy ( [https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/introduction-to-the-atom/a/preparing-to-study-ap-chemistry](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/chemistry/atomic-structure-and-properties/introduction-to-the-atom/a/preparing-to-study-ap-chemistry) ) but it's recommended that I study a lot of other things (exponents, logarithms, graphing slope-intercept form, quadratic formula, scientific notation, Coulomb's law, etc.) before I start.  

I can't help but feel I don't need to master every single one of these concepts for an introductory university chemistry course? I have an alright understanding of exponents, basic logarithms, and scientific notation, but all-in-all my current algebra skills are only at around a freshman high school level. Would it be okay for me to proceed to self-teach myself introductory chemistry or should I really get a solid foundation of everything that Khan Academy's telling me to study beforehand?",chemistry,t3_d9fmwy
"A love poem inspired by BF3 Dear love,

We human are nothing but atoms

with electrons orbiting around us

Each representing a piece of our lives 

We use them to form bonds with people 

In the two decades that I call life, 

I have made many different bonds

Most ionic, where you give or take

Electrons based on what you need

And few bonds were fully covalent

Where we share a part of our lives

When I first laid my eyes on you,

I quickly knew that you were my pair

I was a Boron with SP2 configuration

P2 orbitals, my two lovely parents

You are my S, my sweet soulmate

The single source of my shy songs

Perhaps you are like a Fluorine

With so much life surrounding you

We are polar opposites of each other

which is precisely what strengthens us

With my parents and you, I was satisfied

I’ve formed enough bonds to be stable

Nonetheless, something was missing

incomplete, a part of me yet to be shared

T’was the free P-orbital that moved me

A simple sign for us to be parents

A family of my own will complete me

Thus answer me, my love. Will you marry me?

&amp;#x200B;

Prob a shitpost LOL",chemistry,t3_d99oun

"Ionization energy in D orbitalsAs you move across a period, the general trend is that ionization energy increases because the atom become smaller. However, as you move across the d orbitals, the shielding effect increase because the d orbital electrons act as a shield from the nucleus for the S orbital electrons. Therefore, wouldn’t the Ionization energy decrease?",chemistry,t3_d9dmbh

"advice- an opportunity to researchi’m a junior chemistry major at a large university. i’ve been emailing professors asking if there’s any room in their lab so i can get involved in research (it’s required for me to graduate)

one professor emailed me back asking for my transcripts &amp; told me to meet with her tomorrow to discuss “[her] research directions and [my] research interests”

tbh, idk what my research interests are bc i’ve never done any. i don’t even know what research labs look like! i really just wanna get started in it so i can get a feel for if this is what i wanna do in graduate school. her research is in aerosols/climate change &amp; combustion chemistry. 

i have 0 clue how to use any of the machines she prob has in lab. idek if i’m smart enough to work in her lab. i’m really nervous for this meeting because i’d love to start research, but i’m wondering if i’m even qualified enough to do so. any advice?",chemistry,t3_d9b7dp

"Metals electron emission and rustIm fairly new to chemistry so bare with me.

In my chem class we've been learning about how light in certian KE can move electrons around in the energy shell or possible cause emission from the shell itself. 

Would this mean metal under say, gamma ray would be under such wave length and energy that an electron is completely emitted changed the valence of the metal? 
If thats true i could see where room would be left for ionic bonds with oxygen creating rust and other corrosion. 
Or is the electron to be lost not nessecarily part of the metals structure?",chemistry,t3_d99x28

"Alternative weed killer concentrate to acetic acid?I have read about salt/soap/vinegar solution to kill weeds/plants. I need to spray a long, long driveway. Even concentrated acetic acid (45%) will take a LOT to fill up my tow behind sprayer. I've seen people use just salt and soap, which I will try, but wondered if there is another acid that I could easily use which I can buy concentrated. 

I am somewhat familiar with handing caustic chemicals, I was using pot ash for water treatment and have the necessary PPE. I was hoping there might be something granular/powdered that I could dissolve in water to create some sort of acidic solution to help kill the weeds. Something not too hazardous. 

Is there any possibility for this?",chemistry,t3_d99r70
