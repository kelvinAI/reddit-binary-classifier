Comment below on any other events happening in October, and I'll add them in!",singapore,t3_dbnhzj
"Why do people think Singapore is boring?This is the common reason among my friends why they want to move out of Singapore or go overseas to study. They like to say Singapore has nothing to do, there are no interesting people and there are no interesting places to go to. 

Not being overly sentimental, but I think Singapore is fine the way it is. In fact, I love it. There are beautiful sights to catch - sunsets, skylines, nature parks etc. Have you ever tried taking a stroll in the CBD at night? It’s a very surreal experience to wander on empty streets surrounded by towering frames of glass and steel that are gently illuminated by the orange neon. I don’t think anyone can get that experience in other countries without being overwhelmed by crowded tourist traps or bright piercing lights that are a real cacophony.

And who says there aren’t interesting places to go? If one is adventurous enough to explore the more rural roads, you can find those small nuggets that are the SAF’s bases, like school of ammo in Rifle Range or ST Kinetics building in the middle of the jungle right outside the central catchment area. Gombak used to have a trekking path that cuts into MINDEF’s small hill (but sadly it closed cuz of erosion).

Also, the geography of the island. Ohhh the geography. The diamond shape is such beautiful geography. One moment you are in bukit batok, the next you are in Clementi after walking about 45 minutes. Walk further and you reach the sea. Walk along the coast and you reach Downtown. It’s homely with all the neighbourhoods nicely and conveniently situated next to each other. In any other country, there would be no limits to the urban area and sometimes, there is just a town sitting in the middle of vast hinterlands. Singapore is just like a video game map, something out of GTA.

Idk, or am I actually a siaolang?",singapore,t3_dkur1r

"Anyone regretted not studying hard enough?Why have not studied hard enough in the past? Is it because you mixed with the wrong company like matreps, video game addiction or you are just plain lazy?

How are you coming to terms with your live now? Also, have you ever felt that you have let your parents down?",singapore,t3_dkvcyy

"Maids in SingaporePosting here after an observation for several days.

My grandma got hospitalised recently so for several days I've been accompanying for the entire time. So we saw a maid who was taking care of an ahma who got hospitalised too, but we noticed that she didn't eat for the entire time we were there (and it was for several days). My grandma then talked to her (in very broken english) and found out that she didnt eat yesterday at all. Throughout the day we smuggled some food for the maid to eat but she was so deathly afraid to accept it initially because the ahma will scold her.

Is this actually more common in Singapore than i initially thought it was? It feels like maid abuse at this stage. Any suggestions on how to help without worsening the situation for the maid as well?",singapore,t3_dkzroc

"Hypothesis: the average singaporean can't really empathize with Hong Kong because we've never really cared about democracy.We've never had to fight for democracy. In the 50s our fight wasn't so much pro-democracy as it was anti-colonial. As everyone knows, we didn't even want to be a country of our own, and had independence shoved upon us, after which we had to worship economic progress in order to survive. 

Hypothesis #2: we care more about economic success than democracy and civil freedoms 

So many of the comments from Singaporeans regarding HK have to do with their distaste stemming from how messy and chaotic everything has become. We've never really had to choose between order and democracy, so of course it confounds us when we see people choose to fight for democracy at the expense of order and economic stability. There's almost a sadistic snicker underlying Singaporeans' comments whenever they talk about how HK's economy is tanking because of the protests, how businesses are moving their operations and assets away from HK and into Singapore. 

Hypothesis #3: we care more about economic success within late capitalism than about democratic freedoms.

How are we supposed to understand HK's language of civil disobedience and civic participation when we've never managed to develop a vocabulary for civic participation? We tap ourselves on the back for pRagMatiC rEsiStaNce, thinking that we've developed such a uniquely Singaporean way of making our requests heard (and being okay that it takes bloody forever) because historical amnesia has been written into our DNA. Dissenters have been painted as anti-country troublemakers in our history textbooks, and we have been programmed to see protests as anti-order and therefore anti-national. Sure, we say we are a democratic nation. But we can't forget that our nation-building happened during a time where you were either democratic or broke because the West was on a campaign to snuff communism out. So embracing democracy could be seen as a way for us to align ourselves to the US and the UK and ensure that we manage to tap on their resources so that their MNCs would come and set up shop and help us industrialize and gain economic success to the dizzying rate that most of our neighbours were only able to dream of.

We've been brought up to see economic success and bureaucratic efficiency as being at the core of what it means for Singapore to be Singapore, and tbh that's just really sad. 

Not here just to make an EdGy coMmEnt so I'm really open to having these ideas challenged! Can't say I'm a history expert but I definitely think my thoughts here are grounded in historically sound ideas, but, again, am very open to pushback. If i dont respond it means im chewing on your ideas or that i have been swallowed whole by my day job.",singapore,t3_dkleum

"(Urgent) Unable to get refund from travel agencyHi everyone, 

My friend and I booked a trip to Nepal online through Travelgenio in March. On the day before we were set to fly, our flight got cancelled. 

We contacted Travelgenio, and after confirming the cancellation of the flight, the lady over the phone told us to wait for our refund. 

About a month later, we didn’t hear from Travelgenio, so we called them again. They say that the refund is still pending.

In the months that follow up til today, we contacted Travelgenio via email twice, each time receiving the same reply.

"What is the future of Singapore/Hawker Cuisine ?I know there has been much talk about not just our local identity and love based around our local food scene, but it's something that had been talked about how it may be a 'dying trade'

Do you feel that our local food is threatened? I know some people are interested in preserving it, but no doubt, hawker business isn't easy. Couple that with people wanting to adapt it into more unique dishes, some people are skeptical (it's like Italians and their fierce pride for Italian food)

Personally I have no issue with 'modernizing' Singapore food. Singapore food had never been 'original', it was our ancestors would adapted their home flavours to this foreign land. So long as food taste good and its worth the price, I honestly can't give a damn.

And I wouldn't mind foreigners taking over local food stores, if they're willing to preserve the dishes passed down by their hawker masters too. It's hypocritical when we we don't want to continue but Kpkb when we see PRC people cooking our food as though only we are allowed to cook our own food. 

But I really don't like the franchising of food courts under big companies, and I hope they aren't able to just own hawker centers outrightly (I don't think it's likely)

The cashless systems for hawkers really need refining though, if they can roll out a nationwide nfc payment for hawkers, it'll be a big plus for plenty of Singaporeans and tourists alike.",singapore,t3_dkvcnt

Competition is good, it spurs people to improve themselves and it is a motivator for people to excel in work/studies.

Lane-cutting on the roads to overtake even though the person isn't late for work

Relatives one-upping over the other during CNY to prove that their children are better

Micro-aggressions by some Singaporeans to prove that they are right

"Job Portal Concept [Idea Feedback/Possible Implementation if viable]- For those tired of ineffective/non responsive job portalsGood day to everyone, I have an idea I am entertaining which came to mind recently and I would like to put it out there, however, considering the fact that my target audience would initially be solely locals, I would like to get some feedback on it before actually embarking on said project.

Job searching as of today has its own problems and if things were to continue as-is, I believe we will reach a level of saturation with regards to the amount of applicants. This combined with the lack of a standardised system, will ultimately result in lower employment in areas which may actually have a good number of decent applicants.

There is no limit to who my target group is; meaning anyone from part time to full time to managerial roles are covered. (management/c suite roles will definitely require a different hiring approach but that has been taken into consideration and will definitely be given more in depth planning prior to implementation, probably late stage)

*Problems faced by:*

**Applicants**

* Lack of response from job posters/employers (waiting time of more than 1 week on average for most job portals)
* Spam from recruitment agencies (resulting in unclear job scopes that might change during the actual interview/ dissappointment due to unmet salary expectations)
* Unclear/unrealistic job description (e.g 3 years experience, ability to do build, clean and maintain a house -&gt; Entry Level Job)
* No information on company
* Unsure of standards/reliability of company that you are applying for.
* Unable/difficult to track who has gotten back to you/not or when you previously applied for a company (some websites already do this but not all)

**Employers**

* Applicants have to be vetted (manual processes like resume/ basic questions)
* Lack of compatibility with workplace environment \*
* Unmet expectations due to the current standards of job ads (they expect way more because we don't adhere to actual advertised salary counts, we use it more like a baseline for comparison) \*

^(\* previously worked on another solution that I would be able to resolve these issues with)

I am currently drafting an idea to create a portal that would resolve these issues to a major extent, for starters, requiring both employers and applicants to reply to applications within a predefined time frame as well as setting a scoring system that accounts for companies/applicants who are applying/hiring with accordance to good practices.

Please feel free to leave suggestions if you feel there are areas which i missed (definitely have as I haven't done any surveys or anything of the sort thus far). But the main point of this post is to find out; if I built such a site and managed to convince employers/hiring mangements to post jobs, would you use it to find a job? Or do you think that existing sites already serve the purpose?

"Advice wanted: My estate's rooftop carpark is a teenage love hotelHi r/Singapore, I've noticed something really troubling happening in my estate recently. So a bit of pretext, my flat is located next to a multi-storey carpark that has a roof garden, which is great for me, because I get unblocked views from my house. However, recently I've been told by my sister that she noticed teens (usually a boy and a girl) coming up to the roof of the carpark during the wee hours of the night, and they were PDA-ing as told by my sis. Anyways, I personally didn't see anything happening there so I didn't think much about it. Well, until today. So today at dusk I saw a teen couple being intimate with each other on the roof. Ew. I don't know if the teens don't know or don't care if people from the flats nearby can see them, but I definitely don't want to see them.

"Why does Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin sounds similar?Aussie here learning Mandarin. There is this mystery I have wondered about for a very long time, ever since I started with Mandarin years ago. I noticed that Mandarin spoken in Taiwan and Singapore sounds exactly the same and is very different to Mandarin spoken in China.

As far as I know, no one has noticed how Singapore and Taiwanese sounds so similar. I've searched online but there was nothing about it. I've asked Chinese people about this, but they either don't know what Singapore Mandarin is like, or don't know what Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin is like. When I asked the Taiwanese, they too don't know what Singapore Mandarin is like.

Recently, I met someone from Singapore and we spoke in Mandarin. Immediately I feel like I'm speaking to a Taiwanese person. I told her that her accent sounds like Taiwanese and I have always thought that both accents sounds so similar. She said it's very actually very different, but she couldn't give an explanation. Funny enough, we at a food fair together and later she was speaking to one of the food vendors who was Chinese. They were speaking in Mandarin about the food and at one point the guy said ""...很好吃，你们台湾人喜欢的"". It was the first time I saw someone else made the connection between Singapore and Taiwanese Mandarin, other than myself. So I know it isn't just me that thinks this.

Taiwan and Singapore are so far and have nothing to do with each other. China is closer to Singapore and has a way bigger population than Taiwan. Singapore Chinese people are descendants of people from China, not Taiwan. As far as I know, there wasn't any special historical or modern relationship and interactions between the two places. So why would Singapore have a similar accent to Taiwan, and not China?

I’m studying visual communication.

So far, I’m looking at NAFA, Lasalle and SIM.

NAFA and SIM offers top up degree. (One year only)
School fees are similar (22k +, not including overseas study programme)
NAFA is affiliated to University of Central Lancashire, UK. (Which I honestly have not heard of)
SIM is affiliated to RMIT Australia.

Lasalle is 3 years. If my portfolio is good enough my diploma studies are relevant, I can be exempted from year 1 so thus 2 years.
School fees is $9730 per annum.
I’ve heard from my friends at Lasalle that the overseas programs are only for selected students.

Last but not least, NTU ADM. I’m not that confident that I’ll get in, plus it’s 3-4 years :(

I know when it comes to the design industry, it’s skills &gt; qualifications. But since I’ll be spending my money and time doing degree, I might as well choose as good school.

"An old lady asked me go to hell after me refusing to give her money.Long story short, I was happily having my lunch in a not so humid weather, then an old lady who is in her early 70s approached me and asked me if I have 20 cents to spare. I then said no. I questioned myself if that 20 cents meant a lot to me, then I turned around to look for that lady only to find out that someone already spared her the coins. Not long after that, she approached me again and say “I’m only asking for 20 cents, not $2000, 去死跟好” WOW i was beyond stunned ****. What’s worse was that I kind of retaliated to her and said “你去死先啦”. Also what’s worse than that is I should have just let that slide away since she’s already that old but Im just a human being who is not perfect :( I have feelings too :(

Anyways, happened at West Coast hawker. Be careful if you ever stumbled upon this lady.

"Wildlife in Singapore; Part 49: SunbirdsHi r/singapore, this week I'll be covering a family of birds that has several representatives in Singapore, including some that are easily encountered in urban areas - the [sunbirds](https://besgroup.org/2007/11/06/heliconias-and-sunbirds/).

There are 145 known species of sunbirds, making up the family Nectariniidae. They are found in sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, the Comoros and Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean, the Middle East, southern China, and South and Southeast Asia, with two species found as far as New Guinea, and one species present in the Solomon Islands and northern Australia. These are small birds that possess [thin, curved bills](https://flic.kr/p/Ek6Sia). Males of many species have [colourful, iridescent plumage](https://flic.kr/p/24kgVYe), while females are [more drably coloured](https://flic.kr/p/2ffcb7y). Due to very [similar coloration](https://flic.kr/p/7DWDxL), the [females](https://flic.kr/p/oa9xSB) of [different sunbird species](https://flic.kr/p/GrLVo) can be quite challenging for novices to tell apart.

Sunbirds feed primarily [on nectar](https://besgroup.org/2012/12/12/sunbirds-sipping-nectar-from-flowers/), playing an important role in pollination. However, for some plant species, sunbirds may engage in nectar robbing, [piercing the base of the flower](https://besgroup.org/2009/01/17/olive-backed-sunbird-robbing-hibiscus-nectar/) to access the nectar, without picking up or depositing any pollen. Sunbirds supplement their diet with [insects and spiders](https://besgroup.org/2008/05/03/olive-backed-sunbird-taking-spider/), especially during nesting. Some species will consume [small fruits and seeds](https://besgroup.org/2016/11/04/brown-throated-sunbird-fruit-feeding/).

Sunbirds can be considered the African and Asian equivalent of the hummingbirds, which are endemic to the Americas. This is an example of convergent evolution, as sunbirds and hummingbirds are not closely related to each other, and are found in different parts of the world, but have independently evolved similar lifestyles. However, unlike hummingbirds, sunbirds can only [hover for short periods of time](https://besgroup.org/2016/07/27/olive-backed-sunbird-harvesting-nectar-of-firecracker-plant-russelia-equisetiformis-flower/), and usually prefer to feed while perching. Unfortunately, many people in Singapore seem unaware of the difference, and misidentify sunbirds as hummingbirds.

During the breeding season, sunbirds gather plant material, spider silk, and even [synthetic fibres](https://besgroup.org/2010/05/11/olive-backed-sunbird%e2%80%99s-blue-nest/), building a [pendant, oval, or pear-shaped nest](https://flic.kr/p/V9MwVa) with [a side entrance](https://flic.kr/p/ryofSD) that is [suspended from a thin branch](https://flic.kr/p/ehv1Vr) or twig. Two to three eggs are laid, and [the young](https://flic.kr/p/esQFxD) are fed with small insects and spiders until they fledge.

At least ten species of sunbirds have been [recorded in Singapore](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/mygreenspace/issue-41-vol-2-2019/lifestyle/recreation-and-activities/identifying-the-sunbirds-of-singapore), and I will cover them in follow-up comments.

It is then clear that it is just a sales tactic to promote and mislead consumer to sign up their One account which bundle with endowment, credit card and spending in order to enjoy the higher interest rates. Even though I did not sign up, I feel cheated with such tactic they engage with their customers.

"Need some advice on audit dilemmaI’m the poor soul that is designated to liaise with external auditors in my department that is doing sales. (I’m in an MNC)

While preparing and retrieving certain cases that are closed, I realised that the sales people are skipping a lot of the “inconvenient” steps that are put in place after past years audits.

I have managed some cases myself, and I can tell that there’s no shady shit involved, they are probably just skipping steps for the sake of being fast. These people are experienced, hence they know what they are doing.

Now the problem is... I’m supposed to clean up their cases (magically produce all the missing documents/steps, backdate them) before I pass them to the external auditor. I know this is a norm in many companies but it just feels wrong.. Should I not do them so that I won’t make myself liable for anything? &amp;lt; and risk losing my job cause I’m still on probation :/

tldr - on probation, tasked to clean up closed cases by my sales team before sending the cases to external auditors.
_____

Edit for more clarity:

Simplified sales process-
Step 1: fact find, 
Step 2: Prepare a quote and justify why you are quoting that rate,
Step 3: client agree to the terms,
Step 4: close the case.

Now when I’m doing the audit checks, I found out that some cases are missing step 2/3. 

Superior is asking me to plug in the gaps myself but I’ve decided that I will compile a list of missing documents, approach the relevant salespeople and get them to justify the missing documents themselves.

"Advice wanted: NUS electrical engineering student considering SCDF civilian positionsI am a second-year NUS electrical engineering student (working on bachelor of engineering in electrical engineering). I am considering applying for a SCDF [civilian position](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/join-us/civilian-positions) after graduation, albeit I am open to other career paths.

**I would like your advice regarding this consideration of mine (e.g. potential internship opportunities I should consider).**

**These questions are for those who are working in SCDF civilian positions:**

1. **Do you hold a diploma or a degree?**
2. **What do you think of your working conditions (nature of the job, environment, co-workers etc)?**
3. **How are your working hours?**
4. **How much is your yearly pay?**
5. **What do you like about your job?**
6. **What do you dislike about your job?**
7. **What do you believe one should look out for if he or she applies for and takes up this position?**
8. **What are some confounding factors (e.g. your prior work experience) that I should consider when reading your answers?**

Thank you for reading and have a nice day. :)

* NUS: National University of Singapore

**Extra reading for those of us who are a bit more kaypoh:**

&gt;!After graduating from junior college I applied for NUS electrical engineering, originally because I had the unrealistic dream of recreating the protoss robotics army from Starcraft II in reality. However after 2 semesters of instruction and crap grades I realized that this dream was impossible to make true. I lost motivation to study and just wanted to get the piece of paper, with no goal job in mind. Watching Fire Force / Enn Enn no Shouboutai and reading stories about the Hong Kong Fire Services Department (HKFSD) during their home's recent civil/political unrest made me realize the underappreciated real-life heroes that firefighters are.!&lt;

&gt;!I understand that I can never become a firefighter because I have eczema. However, I feel like I want to support these honourable people who save lives instead of condemn lives (there's also a religious dimension towards this wish). I would be in a better position to support firefighters (mainly my own job duties, but also possibly buy them drinks, talk with them, encourage them) if I were in a SCDF civilian position than if I were not. (""Why is this Microsoft/Seagate engineer buying drinks for firefighters? Does he or his company have an ulterior motive threatening the security of the nation?"")!&lt;

&gt;! Not all NUS students are smart. From this post you can probably tell that I'm actually incredibly stupid.!&lt;",singapore,t3_dj80zp

1. One of those 'not sure what I want to do or want to be' as a career, but has some interest in sports science and fitness.
2. Took and passed a basic sports science course (ACE-RP) recently.
3. Have a diploma in Business/IT. Not too keen on continuing in IT as I find it uninteresting despite the career prospects and a place in SUSS Infocomm Tech programme which is to start next year.

Questions:

1. What do you think about the programme?
2. What should I be prepared for if I were to join the programme?
3. Do I have to further my studies after graduation? (E.g. Major/PhD)
4. (For alumni only) How easy or difficult is it to find a job in Singapore after you graduate, or do you have to live overseas to be employed? Do you like your current job?

"Parents cut off supportHi. some of you might remember me as the person who was about to become homeless in my previous post few months ago and here's an update and a bigger issue..

Father is the biggest problem, do nothing and only contribute negativity and always psycho my mom and talk shit and I have been keeping quiet all the time until I had lost it and exploded at them. So they became salty, mom stopped giving me allowance since last month. Father psycho my mom to stop paying for my phone bill and school fees too. Father even want to ruin my future and said when my school fees isn't paid, I would get expelled and mindef would call me to enlist.. wasting my 2 years in poly and not getting my diploma and getting impromptu enlistment.

Furthermore, he threatened to not give me any of their supporting documents if I were to apply for poly bursary next year. They even said it straight to my face that if I'm unhappy with them, I can move out, which is so ridiculous as I'm still a student. Is like telling me to fly when I can't even crawl?? What stupid statement is that.

I reached out to whatever help there is.. social service, school and even the court, all helpless. Even the court ownself tell me they couldn't help?!?!?? So what can I do now??

For those who wants to know some context, you can continue reading below

Things hasn't been going well ever since and it's going downhill steeply. Since my previous post, I helped my family get 2 room HDB rental. After we moved in, I'm the one doing all the work, searching for flat to view, arranging appointments, literally doing agent's work and being parent's financial planner. However, the USELESS father of mine have been so picky and still want to see what fengshui when they don't even have money to play with. Needless to say people who are poor, normal people would get what's within their means. But this useless father have the requirements of a fucking millionaire. Even give him strike million dollar lottery, no house could please him, even a freaking bungalow.

FYI, one time just cos father was nostalgic to the times when we lived in sembawang when I'm still a kid, they optioned a house there on impulse, knowing that the very first owner had loan shark case and then backed out afterwards and I was the one who got the deposit back for them. A second time when we found the perfect house at a good price and optioned it, father backed out last minute again and went mia on our agent. That point of time my mom is even against him and sick of his shit.

And now the tables have turned. Father psycho mom until they've purchased BTO. a fucking 3 room flat which I wouldn't have a room (I have 2 sis). When in the first place we could've buy 4 room and it's contradicting that parents are the ones who said not to get 3 room because it's not feasible and next time were to sell, cannot profit (LOL still want to think until there? see how ignorant they are).

What worse, if they want to buy a 3 room now, they could afford, even if it's flat that just MOP. They have fucking poor judgement. You guys can do the math. Now monthly rental is $380+ per month plus town council fee, let say $400. Having to pay $400 for the next 5 years till we get the BTO, that already $24,000. They rather spend that amount over 5 freaking years to live in a shit environment and pathetic 2 room rental flat, than to buy a 3 room flat now that can be 94 years lease left. Just because they want a brand new flat with 99 years? The BTO they bought is about $250K plus $50K levy which a total of $324K could get a good 3 room now or even a budget 4 room. Plus by that time I would be out working and can move out on my own. I need a proper home now

I did so much and rather everything for them. After using me and this is how I get treated? They don't even recognise all the shit I did for them. They even said I do nothing and only leach on all the benefits like what? One very ridiculous example is that paying singtel bill by singtel dash give an extra GB of data and father said I don't contribute to the phone bill but being a freeloader. I was even being thoughtful for them in case I exceed data.

LOL fucking end my life already. these kind of parents where to find. Seriously im fucking depressed right now. Someone just bail me out and I'm even looking for a guardian right now. Seriously what can I do? I have no control and i am powerless.. seriously i didn't ask to be born into such mess.. I already did what I could

Edit 1: To add on more. Mentioned in my previous post, father hasn't been working for as long as I could remember, even till now. He REFUSE to work. He only happened to worked part time for about 2 months recently so he could have some spare cash for himself and his 2-3 packs of cigg everyday. What's stupid is that he could've work 3 months of full time just for the sake of getting a higher loan amount to buy a decent 4 room flat. BUT HE REFUSED. It doesn't make any fucking sense and it's so contracting cos he said one reason he not want work is cos I wouldn't be eligible for bursary. FUCK SAKE. I rather have a home then having a $2k bursary one time a year.. He could give me allowances to make up for the loss of bursary. and the irony that now they are the ones preventing me from applying my bursary LOL. Just imagine how fucking poor his judgement are. Sacrificing to get a deceent home for a small $2k bursary which wouldn't mean a thing compared to a much bigger loan they could get, and now sabotaging me to not get bursary. In the end it's all lose-lose",singapore,t3_dio1tn

"Advice on NUS masters in CSI'm considering doing a masters in NUS or NTU CS, with a focus on AI. My working hours are relatively flexible since I run my own company, and the reason why I'm considering a masters is a) for self-learning and b) online classes don't work well for me.

I was just wondering about the following:

a) what is the main difference between full-time and part-time student? Is it just the max amount of modules per semester or is it different lecturers, class timings, etc?

b) How good are the AI classes in NUS or NTU, and is there a particular standout class or lecturer? My main interests are in recommendation systems.",singapore,t3_dj1mcn

"Former Chief Justice Pens article arguing that 377A is not compatible with Article 12 of the Constitution**edit: The URL is working again - the full article can be found at**  [https://journalsonline.academypublishing.org.sg/Journals/Singapore-Academy-of-Law-Journal/e-First/ctl/eFirstPDFPage/mid/519/ArticleId/1233?Citation=Published+on+e-First+14+October+2019](https://journalsonline.academypublishing.org.sg/Journals/Singapore-Academy-of-Law-Journal/e-First/ctl/eFirstPDFPage/mid/519/ArticleId/1233?Citation=Published+on+e-First+14+October+2019) 

This one is going to be a bit esoteric, and the primary document is a 75 page legal essay that I don't think everyone is going to read. So the TDLR is:

\- Chan Sek Keong has written an article that essentially puts forward the argument that 377A is in conflict with Article 12 of the constitution

\- His argument (very briefly) is that due to changes in the law the purpose behind 377A is no longer applicable and hence there is no reasonable basis for 377A to discriminate against men. As such, 377A is not compatible with Article 12 of the constitutional (the ""equality article""). This argument is relatively novel, and was not used in the previous 377A cases.

\- This article was published yesterday, just weeks before the 377A court hearings in the High Court next month

\- The merits of the legal arguments aside, this is a pretty remarkable intervention by a former CJ, just before a case is to be heard by the Court.

&amp;#x200B;

Summary paragraph:

*133 The conclusions and submissions of this article on the decisions of the Courts on the constitutional validity of s 377A are as follows:*

*(a) Section 377A was not intended to cover penetrative sex, that is, anal or oral sex, when it was enacted in 1938 as the same offences had already been covered by s 377 since 1872. Section 377A covers only non-penetrative sex, such as masturbation and other kinds of sexual touching and “lewd” acts.*

*(b) In so far as the Courts have decided that s 377A does not violate the fundamental rights of equality before the law and equal protection of the law on the basis that s 377A covers penetrative sex, the decisions are not binding on lower courts as being given per incuriam.*

*c) If so, it is open to an applicant or defendant in a new action or prosecution to contend that s 377A violates Art 12(1) on the ground that it unreasonably or arbitrarily discriminates against male homosexuals in respect of acts of gross indecency of a non-penetrative nature.*

*(d) If s 377A had been enacted to criminalise penetrative sex covered under s 377, it would have the effect of impliedly repealing the same offences in s 377. If s 377A had impliedly repealed those offences in s 377 in 1938, those offences criminalised by s 377A would have been impliedly repealed by s 376(1)(a) in 2007 to the extent of their inconsistency, that is, with respect to consensual penetrative sex between males.*

*(e) Under s 376(1)(a), consensual penetrative sex between males in private is no longer criminalised as an unnatural offence (because s 377 has been repealed) but is punishable under s 20 of the Minor Offences Act or s 294(a) of the Penal Code, if performed in public.*

*(f) The legislative purpose or object of s 377A determined at the time of its enactment in 1938 will always remain the same thereafter. Accordingly, the retention of s 377A by Parliament in 2007 does not affirm or reaffirm its 1938 purpose.*

*(g) Section 377A was enacted for the purpose of dealing with the mischief of male prostitution and its associate activities (which involved male homosexual conduct) which were rife in 1938, and not because male homosexual conduct was not acceptable in Singapore society in 1938.*

*(h) The purpose of s 377A as described in (g) above ceased to exist or was no longer valid in 2007 or 2013, or there was no evidence that similar conditions existed in 2007 or 2013. Accordingly, the legislative classification (or differentia) would no longer be reasonable and would not have rational relation to the purpose of s 377A (having ceased to exist). Section 377A therefore cannot satisfy the requirements of the reasonable classification test and therefore violates Art 12(1).*

*(i) Section 377A, being a pre-constitution law, cannot be declared void for unconstitutionality because Art 162 requires any existing law to be construed to conform to the Constitution. Accordingly, the court has to interpret s 377A by reading it to have a meaning that does not violate the Constitution. How s 377A should be construed (or read) to conform to the Constitution depends on the nature of its inconsistency with Art 12(1).*

*(j) If the purpose of s 377A has ceased to exist in 2007 or 2013, s 337A may be construed to conform to the Constitution by reading it as a gender-neutral provision that criminalises non-penetrative sex of gross indecency committed in public.*",singapore,t3_di1492

* Service Type: Postal
* Category: Advertising Mail
* Sub Category: OPT-OUT Service

I live in a block where you can lock the shutter of your mailbox so that you don't have to deal with all sorts of random spam, but I was still having to deal with all the useless crap that SingPost would deliver to me on a frequent basis. So I called SingPost some time ago and asked them if there was a way to opt out, and there is!

I figured that opting out was a better alternative than wasting all that paper (hey, at least the ball is out of my court now) and also wasting my time grabbing all the junk just to deliver it straight to the trash. Not to mention it's highly annoying how everyone just throws all the spam on the floor or on top of the postbox itself.

Bear in mind that SingPost was a little draggy with my request. After I submitted the first form, they sent me an email asking for almost the exact same questions again in order to be really sure that I wanted to opt out (dot dot dot). Once the process is complete they'll stick a ""NO ADMAIL"" sticker inside your mailbox and you'll be done!

Some months have passed now since I completed the opt out process and the amount of ""noise"" in my mailbox has drastically reduced. Like I really don't get any spam anymore. This also means it's a lot less likely that I'll accidentally throw away some legitimate mail that has been stuck under a heap of junk.

"Sharing My Bariatric (Weight Loss) Surgery JourneyLong read ahead:


So I want to share some personal journey. Last Feb I went for bariatric surgery, that’s a weight loss surgery more specifically I did the gastric sleeve where they cut my stomach by 80% so I eat very little and feel super full real fast. 

For context, I am female, 36 this year and 1.68m. I was very active before, did Muay Thai and MMA but one training session some time in 2012, my back gave way and I had to stop. I did more than just stop, I completely let myself go since and gained so much weight over the years. Just before the surgery, I went in at 105kg - the heaviest I’ve ever been. I decided to do something about it and over nearly a year period of consultations, research and monitoring, I finally did the surgery. 

It wasn’t an easy journey, and there have been plenty of learnings. I want to debunk some misconceptions about weight loss surgery primarily that it is a “quick, lazy way” to lose weight because I’ve had some hard core people coming at me about it (it’s all about exercise and food!!!! they screamed at me). Some obese people have dire urgent need to lose weight quickly because of various reasons commonly diabetes or severe sleep apnea. They do not have the luxury of that 1-2 years it takes to lose weight the “natural way”. Losing weight quickly via surgery helps them to then maintain and in the support group, it’s been proven that it works as it drastically drops the % of risk in just 3 months post surgery in the case of diabetes and heart problems. In the first year post op we have dieticians working to help us develop good eating habits so that we can continue on the journey afters ourselves. 

2 weeks pre surgery I was prescribed strict liquid meal placement 3 times a day. It was so fucking hard for someone who loves food. Post surgery was even harder it was 1 month of clear fluids which means I can only drink clear soup/broth and just sips of water. Then it was 2 weeks of blended meals, followed by 1 month of soft meals then gradually regular food. I can now only stomach maybe 1 spoon of rice, 2 spoons size meat and a spoon veg. But I am able to workout again without feeling pain everywhere - it was painful to exercise when your entire body weight is slamming on your knees and ankles. I sleep better at night, don’t feel sleepy during the day and my back doesn’t ache just to name a few good stuff that came out of it. I’ve had to make some life adjustments regarding eating especially since a lot of our lives revolve around food - social gathering, festivities, birthdays, team lunches, client lunch meetings are so hard because everyone’s like oh you’re not eating? that’s all you ordered? and I wasn’t about to start telling everyone this longass story.

I have dropped approx. 30kg since March and am now at 74. The plan given is over a 10-month period to get to my ideal weight of 68kg. I will be on meds for the next 2 years with medical appointments every other month. Some side effects: hair loss for up to 8 months post op due to loss of nutrients, potentially throwing up a lot as your body adjust to your food intake.  

Now cost-wise, because I have severe sleep apnea and pre-diabetic, this is considered a medical surgery. A lot of tests to be done to determine this. If you don’t have any medical issues, they will not do it for you or it will be considered cosmetic. To which you’re not eligible for any medical subsidies. You have to be Singaporean for the standard health care subsidies (I am). The total cost of my surgery incl. hospital stay (C class) is S$16k (without any further post op complications). As a Singaporean and with medical conditions, you’re eligible for up to 40% subsidy, and the balance can be paid via Medisave (depends on your income, up to a certain amount). At the end of it all, I only paid S$360 IN CASH. Do note that various appointments (Surgeon, Dietician, blood tests, sleep tests etc) leading up to surgery at the hospital (I went to CGH) will cost individual sums, avg. of $30-40. 

I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have about the journey in the comments if I miss any info. I encourage you to go for some talks, hospitals hold bariatric talks regularly and are free. Talk to them and find out more even if it’s just for research. 

TLDR: I went for a weight lost surgery and it isn’t as easy as everyone thinks it is but that shit was worth it.

"Let's be rational about NS deferment for SportsmenRight so everyone would have read about the [news on Ben Davis](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/footballer-ben-davis-no-plans-return-singapore-thailand-fulham-11995954?fbclid=IwAR3kBKCjCcXyvHwA2AXlr4qBl-gUF5W0Oc01-fI0-joEp5qcfEvmG_QqlDU) again, and how has no regrets about leaving Singapore behind to pursue his footballing career (in an interview with CNA, he mentioned that he always felt more sense of belonging with Thailand and England than Singapore). After reading all the online comments and vitrol over the issue, I felt that it was important to do a bit of research into how NS deferment (specifically for sports, please) was handled, and how, in my humble opinion, the issue is really much simpler than what many make it out to be, and that (probably unpopular opinion here) Ben Davis really did not make his case favourable for himself (before you jump on me, please read on to understand where I'm coming from!)

In short, for NS deferment for sportsmen there have been three so far: Maximillian Soh (for sailing), Quah Zheng Wen and Joseph Schooling (for swimming). Maximillian was given a year for deferment, and served NS in 2008 or 2009 (not too sure) after he won several accolades but unfortunately didn't perform as well in 2008. For our swimmers, they already had one round of deferment, which was **further extended** when they applied for it till until the end of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Taking a look at the the typical Mindef replies and discussions, it seems pretty clear that, amongst other (smaller) factors, there are two key considerations for deferment: (1) the potential to excel, and (2) the commitment to an 'end' date for the period of deferment.

# Potential to Excel

Fortunately, or unfortunately, Singapore has always applied a 'business' lens to almost every aspect of its domestic policy, including sports. For example, let's assume that we are in the business of handing out grants and money with the aim of helping aspiring start-up businesses grow and succeed. *From a purely business and economic perspective, no organisation would logically give out money to aspiring start-ups that either have no track record or shown the potential to succeed*. Note the word 'potential' here - if a business showed tremendous potential to excel but for one reason or another didn't, it would be lamentable but still reasonably understandable.

The same would be for sportsmen, in my opinion. For the three who have successfully deferred (and I guess Ben Davis too), it is without a doubt that they have shown tremendous potential to succeed in their various areas. While I agree with one comment I read somewhere on Facebook that, technically, Zheng Wen hasn't really shown the potential to really succeed, I think in overall they have proven that they are well and truly above their peers and perform really well, and are thus qualify for NS deferment in this regard.

But should this be the only factor in deferment? Definitely not.

# Commitment to an 'end' date

Based on what I can find online, Mindef has always been clear that if an athlete is able to fulfil (1), they would readily give deferment if they can fulfil (2) as well, because logically there can't reasonably be an 'unlimited' deferment date (if not, it is really like a blank cheque, and going back to the business angle mentioned earlier, does not make much sense). And so in applications for deferments, athletes would have to provide some sort of **milestone to which their deferment would end, and I guess also the opportunity to re-apply for another deferment after assessing (1) again**. It can be a milestone of time, such as Maximillian, where he assessed that one year more would be enough then to prepare and perform...or it can be a milestone of significant games such as our swimmers, where they committed to an end-goal of the Olympics (in 2016 and 2020). I'm pretty sure that, assuming they both achieve fantastic results again at the 2020 Olympics, and Singapore Swimming assesses that they have the potential to excel again at another games (e.g. 2024 Olympics), Mindef would have no qualms about deferring them till the end of the next games, and then reassessing their case thereafter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, what really puzzles me is why Ben Davis would not follow the footsteps of athletes who have successfully deferred, and given that he already has (1), would not do (2) as well. Why not, for example, commit to a milestone of 2 years for example, or commit to a milestone of SEA Games for the AFC, and thereafter, reapplying if necessary? I recognise and agree with what everyone is saying, that the years he is in are the most important in an athlete for their development pathway...and **I agree wholly**. Why not use that and commit to an end-by date, and then if needed, apply again? **All we know is that his father (who is acting on his behalf), was not willing to commit...why not?** This is nothwithstanding the fact that, based on what I could find, his recent statements seem to contradict what his father said in the past, about how he was always willing to contribute to Singapore (vs how he knew he always wanted to leave at 13), and how he was always willing to compete to bring glory to Singapore (vs how he said he never really felt a sense of belonging in Singapore).

In any case, now that this issue is finally 'resolved' and that he clearly doesn't care much about Singapore anymore, hopefully this is the conclusion of a long drawn out chapter revolving around the topics of NS and sports in Singapore, and hopefully, reignites more discussions on how Singapore can manage the development of the sporting scene, and yet without compromising the need for NS.",singapore,t3_dhkdk0

"American angmoh with a dreamHey r/singapore,

I'm a university undergrad from the US about to graduate with my degree in engineering this Spring. Back in 2018, I did an exchange semester at NTU, and was thoroughly impressed with the city and country you all call home. Singapore checks all the boxes on my list regarding the urban lifestyle that I want to lead. I want to move there so badly that it is one of the only things in my life that has not diminished in interest level for 1 whole year. The only thing that is keeping me from moving from the US upon graduation is income.

I have a job in the US lined up right now that pays $110,000 SGD (per year) straight away, and then starts to quickly pay more - around $137,000 SGD 18 months after I start working there, and the pay keeps going up from there. By contrast, the particular engineering role that interests me in Singapore pays about $4000 SGD per month, or about $48,000 SGD per year, which is less than half of what I would make here in the states. I know that taxes are lower, true, but it is still significantly less money. This disparity in income is the only thing holding me back from immediately moving to Singapore.

I have a few questions:

* Is this pay of $4000/month accurate for most students coming out of university? How quickly does this income increase?
* Am I even looking at the right job? (one of my sg friends told me most engineering students go into engineering management roles since ""engineer"" means more like manual labor in Singapore... is this correct?)
* What is someone's actual income after a year? I have heard that some companies add on a bonus at the end of the year to people's paychecks. Is this true?
* How valuable is a Master's degree to Singaporean/international companies in Singapore?

What should I do? Any and all advice is super appreciated! Thanks!",singapore,t3_di3306

I know that Singapore is a relatively safe country and that we can afford to be a bit lax about our stuff , but I think this mentality has to stop. Today, a guy left his credit card unattended . Like really, a credit card. I find think sense of safety to be rather ridiculous as it sets us up to be sitting ducks in the future and makes us vulnerable overseas.

"Questions regarding BTO &amp; relevant loansI've recently completed clearing my uni tuition loans after graduation since last year and am working with my partner towards a BTO. While planning my finances I've some question I'd like to clarify, especially with people experienced with the BTO process. 

1. To clarify: **For the Staggered Downpayment Scheme, I will be able to pay the downpayment in two halves - once during booking, and once during key collections (around 3 years later)**. I have heard from colleagues that there is an option to pay the entire downpayment only upon key collection, though I doubt that is true.
2. To clarify: **For evaluation of grants / eligibilities, only the base pay will be considered. That is, OT payments, Bonuses and Allowances are not considered.** I have also heard from colleagues that since the evaluation is based on your CPF history, OT and bonuses that contribute to CPF will also be considered, which kind of makes sense.
3. To ask: I will have to check with the bank, but since I won't be able to get a loan up to 75% of the house value (assume 400k), I will need to pay a higher downpayment. Assuming I get a loan of 200k for the 400k house, my first stage of staggered downpayment will cost me 100k (400k - 200k, divided by 2). The website assumes I can get a loan of 75% (i.e. loan = 300k, downpayment = 100k), and therefore states that I will only pay 5% cash during the first stage of payment. However **if my downpayment is 200k (50% instead of 25%), is the cash portion still only 5%, or will it increase according to my downpayment requirements?**
4. To ask: **Is it safe to assume I will be able to fully utilize my CPF to pay off my loan installments, regardless of whether it's a bank loan or a HDB loan? Or do I need to set aside cash every month for payment?**

These are the questions I've thought of today. I'm planning to head down to HDB Hub and my bank to ask about these next Saturday morning (since I work office hours), but somehow I'd like to get a gist of the entire process.

Also if anyone wants me to help clarify some doubts for them next week, do feel free to let me know :)",singapore,t3_dgucnn

"today is Coming Out DayToday, 11 October, is Coming Out Day, a day for LGBT awareness.

Frankly, I didn't know anything about it until I saw this mentioned on Oogachaga. Not surprisingly, Coming Out Day started in the US and isn't something that will be observed in Singapore for a long time, if ever at all.

I'm gay and I've known since I was young that I am. I was never attracted to girls, but even in primary school, the pressures of conforming to societal norms was intense. Everyone had to declare they had some crush on a girl, or be seen as abnormal.

The irony is that as a gay, it was always easy for me to get along with girls. There was no hidden agenda since I was never looking to get into their pants. And I had guy friends who were jealous that somehow, girls always seemed more comfortable around me. 

As for my family, they don't suspect a thing. My beloved grandmother had been saving a special dress for the day I get married. My brother openly disses gays in front of me, calling them 'faggots', not realising he is hurting me too. My mom, one time when I tried putting on a earring (purely for fashion, not to make a statement), was almost in tears and asked if it meant I was gay. I told her no and that was that. I can't imagine what her reaction would be if I came out for real.

I am Christian, and it's been tough reconciling my sexuality with my religion. I was caught off guard on one occasion when my pastor dedicated an entire sermon just on the sins of homosexuality. I ran out of church at the end of that session, inconsolable. 

It is painful to read, see and hear of what fundamentalists have to say about gays. It's always easy to blindly condemn when you've never experienced something first-hand, or personally know someone who has. It's even more painful to know of parents who immediately chase their children out the door upon finding out they're gay. To habour such vile and blind hatred upon an offspring of your love, is to me, inexplicable. 

I know what is written in the scriptures. But I also know how I feel.

I didn't ask to be gay. It wasn't up to me. It's not something I can change. 

Being gay is not a 'lifestyle'. It's not like clothes that can be chosen and bought at a store. It makes me the target of discrimination, ridicule, bullying, hate and even violence. You couldn't sell something like that to me, no matter how great any potential 'upsides' to being gay there might be.

So today, on Coming Out Day in Singapore, I remain truly and firmly closeted. 

For a country that prides itself on doing the right thing, I'm disappointed that a law that puts the crosshairs on gays remains a law to this day. While symbolic, it also provides the license for haters to hate.

To my gay elders who've walked the tough road and paved the way for today's generation to come out easier, thank you.

To the younger ones who're still discovering themselves, everybody deserves to be loved.

And to fellow Singaporeans in a society increasingly divided, I hope you choose to love, above all else.",singapore,t3_dgbp1u

"Growing up sucksJust another (Long) text post rant, my thoughts will be all over the place but I need a place to vent before I go into a depressive state again. Thanks Reddit Sg especially those who PM’d me last round, but I just want to be heard, but not to be known. 

Growing up as an average kid in Singapore is difficult. I Guess at least I found it difficult. Each time my mum compared me to my two cousins (who were both blessed with wit and creativity), she’d hold a cane to me and scream “Why can’t you study properly?”. I hated it, not because I was offended by what she said, but because I could never reach that standard- Not because I didn’t try, but simply because my mind wouldn’t let me. 

I remember being recommended for an ADHD check up, which my mum vehemently denied me from (which I’m guessing to shelter me from my career implications down the line). I hated being different, but I could never tell why. My mood would swing based on my emotions and they were always strong, I carried a very jovial and happy front, and when hurt I curled up into a ball emotionally. I could never pay attention for longer than a few minutes, but I’m gifted with a great Long term memory to accommodate to my poor short term memory. I vividly remember memories of my childhood, to the extent that I can remember places, things and even questions from then (but I had no control over what was in my long term).

Till today, I still don’t know if I’m suffering from it, or I’m just imagining it, but at this point I’m just too tired to find out.

I owe a lot to my mum, regardless, for sending me to great tutors after school, who had the patience to guide me forward in secondary school - where I managed barely to scrape into Junior college (I wanted to join a poly, but I get into psych). There (TPJC), I met great Teachers, a fantastic Economics tutor (j2) and a meticulous physics tutor (j2). My economics and physics were consistent E’s (although touted to be easy papers). I never thought that Teachers would be so kind and nurturing to the extent that they stayed back Long after their working hours (close to 6/7pm) just to help me (sometimes alone in a 1-1 consult). It helped me so much that I finally felt competent.

I studied my hardest that year, and was pushed on by my grandma, who I had lived with for years into my teenage years - and managed to score a full set of A’s for my A’s. Could you imagine how happy I was? I’m my mind, I was finally on par with my peers, I was no longer struggling. 

My parents were finally satisfied. My grandma was so happy she called me on my phone for the first time with so much joy in her voice. I was happy, and thought I’d never had to worry about incompetence again, I had finally proven myself to my parents that I was worthy of being a person.

In NS, I experienced my greatest loss, my grandma, who had never placed any academic expectations on me, someone, the only one who had faith in me as a person regardless of how well I did in school, left. The week before, she told me to come back for lunch on the weekend, strong and healthy. I never thought that that would be the last time I saw her. The last time I would hear the voice of someone who I knew had faith in me. (I’m in tears as I look back) I can’t express this hole within me right now, back then and I’ll never ever forget her.

Ns was the fastest phase, it passed simply, and I never really had much expectations placed on my shoulders. 

Post NS, my first experience of how adulthood came. I was lucky enough to had been offered an intern opportunity by a kind stranger, and it just happened to align with my degree. I invited one of my pals from NS- who was going for the same degree. 

We both entered the job with high hopes, and we both worked our hardest. I made an honest mistake in letting a quip go to a coworker, that I wasn’t best of friends with that pal, and as she questioned me deeper, I brushed it off, saying that no one truly was best friends with me. I also said that we gelled extremely well with each other when working, and told her we would make great business partners.

Strange things started happening in the coming weeks. My pal gradually became colder and colder to me, and started becoming the best of buddies with said coworker. 

It took me weeks to find out that my coworker had told my pal about the things I’ve said and twisted it into some sort of “I’m only being his friend for the benefit of him when he becomes a partner of the company”. I was frustrated and I confronted him over it immediately. He told me he had never seen such a snake in his life and I was disgusted at how he chose to listen to a gossip rather than clarify it with me. 

We never truly came to an amicable closure, but I swore never to let anyone twist my words again. I went into work with a friend, and left without one. The two buddies I presume still keep in contact, and I Guess good gossip builds true friendship- something that I’ll never bring myself to do. I was so disheartened that he wouldn’t listen to his pal of 2 years vs this coworker he knew for a month.

Then comes uni, which I am currently stuck in. I honestly have not moved on from my last shit post.  Still the same shit, still the same vibes.

I worked with a few friends on a project as the leader, and I left when one of them claimed my title in order to get an internship.

They took my ideas and entered it into another competition, and just like that I lost all my work to them. I heard they got reported for plagiarism, because they immediately pointed their fingers at me. I didn’t do it. And it’s my fault?

In academics, I lag behind so much but I still put on a brave front. I share notes and anything with my friends, but when I ask one particular guy, he answered me “let me think about it”. I wasn’t angry. I was hurt.

I don’t help people with the expectation of getting help back. I help people because I care about them, but it hurts to know that few would do the same for you. 

Growing up means losing innocence. Growing up means people choose others over you, not to your control. Growing up means losing the friends you had, growing up makes you feel so alone. Growing up means losing the people who had faith in you, growing up means you need to have faith in yourself.

"After reading TNP's review of Joker, I can no longer ignore the fact that our local media's film critics are either restrained or inadequate.*""Joker's main issue is that it wants to have its custard pie and eat it too. Phillips appears desperate for Joker not to be a comic book film and yet it keeps needlessly dropping Batman references.""*

*"" The really annoying thing is that at the end of the day, this is a film about a man's breakdown albeit with some DC Comics properties slapped on it. ""*

I mean, really? Sure, the film could have done without it and still function equally well, but that's what they are saying to substantiate a 2.5/5 rating, because they threw in some easter eggs and some fan service?

Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but really appalled that this is a professional paid to write this.  It could be some censorship involved that restricts them to state some overly socio-political/ left wing/ opinions, or they simply think their audience is not sophisticated enough to appreciate a movie like this.  


Edit: people seem to think im hating on a critic because he doesnt share my sentiments on a film, even though i already said he's entitled to his opinions. i am not. I mean his superficial comments of how it's trying to be a non-comic book-y serious drama, while pandering to fans with references, is his main gripe, is extremely surface level for a piece that he's admitting is hard to ignore or has made an impact.

"Aggregated Driving Tips from r/sgIn a previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/d8jpdn/drivers_in_sg_what_are_the_starter_pack_driving/) I asked about some starter driving laws and tips. Here I have compiled a list so that all can refer.

### Parking
- Do not park at Zig zag yellow lines, double yellow lines, near fire hydrants or against traffic in small roads 
- Do not park on either side of the road when there is a single or double white line in the middle.
- Do not park at single yellow lines between 7am to 7pm except Sundays and PH.
- If parking at HDB look out for the red sign at the bottom of the parking sign board that states if it's only reserved for season parking after 1030pm if you're visiting friends late at night.

### On The Road
- Always keep left unless overtaking and always signal your intention.
- Remember your cashcard or just sign up for vCashcard. Always signal your intention.
- Bus lanes: Normal (Mon to Fri 7.30am to 9.30am; 5pm to 8pm), Full-day (7.30am to 11pm everyday except Sunday and PH). Always signal your intention.
- Take note of mandatory giving way to buses. Recognize the marking especially near bus stops. Always signal your intention.
- Lamp posts with yellow markings are monitored by LTA cams. Always signal your intention.
- Beating red light right turns is as good as beating the red light. Clear traffic on opposite end doesn't mean go if the light is red. Always signal your intention.
- When in the rightmost lane to turn right, turn into the corresponding rightmost lane. Oh and always signal your intention.

### Good Advice
- During discretionary green man turns check for cars and check your mirror for motorbikes trying to squeeze through your sides, physically turn your head to check left and right for pedestrians.
- There is no buffer for speed limits. 90 is 90.
- Right lane is for overtaking, especially on expressways. If you are not going fast enough, move out of that lane.
- Aggressively overtaking and cutting lanes will only save you seconds. It isn’t worth it and you just make it worse for others. Start your day right and just keep in your lane and follow the order.
- Smile and tell yourself why be angry. Everyone is also human. He could be your father or brother. She could be your mother or sister. Humanise other road users and suddenly a PMD user, cyclist, taxi driver or whoever seems more bearable and you just learn to live to let live.

"Limpeh hoping to leave it all behind and start a new life in SingaporeHello all Singaporeans, looking for advice.

Here's my situation: I am a Singaporean who spent more than a decade in the US. I did my NS more than 5 years ago and I graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree. I've been working as an engineer in the US for nearly a year and have been living a very comfortable life, but I'm tired of being in the US.

When I was in Singapore, I was surrounded by family. Here, I just feel so lonely sometimes. No girl wants to touch me here and while I don't feel discriminated against, I feel left out a lot as a minority and disrespected (it's uncommon for Asians to be promoted to management). As a side note, I tried tinder in the US and then in Singapore. I had maybe 5 matches a day in Singapore but in the US I had maybe 3 a week (guess which girls ghosted me and which didn't). But this is more than just my love life; I also want to feel comfortable and I feel most comfortable among my people.

Yet, I have reservations about moving back, which is mainly my career. I feel like I've chosen the wrong major as I think a Mechanical Engineering degree is hard for transitioning back to Singapore. I know that there is Mechanical Engineering jobs in Singapore but I've heard that in general they are underpaid, overworked and underappreciated. I honestly wouldn't mind taking a pay cut to feel a sense of belonging again, but I do want to be on a career trajectory that leads to a respected and well paid profession. (Engineers are paid very well in the US, which is the only reason why I'm sticking around).

What can I do in Singapore career-wise? Can I transition to a different sector such as say, finance or business analytics? Would any of you recommend staying in the mechanical engineering industry in Singapore? What can I even do with a mechanical engineering degree? How do companies view it?

Even if you can't answer the questions, the more information I know about working in Singapore the less blind I feel. Even tangential stories about engineers in Singapore would help a lot, or even career paths. Thank you everyone for your time.",singapore,t3_dftgfg

"Halimah living the live of a Malay. An interesting argument on picking your race.&gt;  
botoxilum-9 points· 4 days ago  
&gt;  
&gt;You’re being a sophist, because it’s pretty evident that Halimah identifies as Malay and has lived her life as a Melayu woman. Whether her father does or doesn’t identify as Malay is a moot point, because we’re talking about her, not her daddy. My point still stands, and you haven’t considered the angle of her father being assimilated into and identifying with Malay Muslim culture (which in all likeliness is the case) even if his IC says something else.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ddnqqi/the\_fall\_from\_prominence\_singapores\_arab\_community/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ddnqqi/the_fall_from_prominence_singapores_arab_community/)

I came across this comment and thought it might worth a wider conversation / discussion. 

It dawned on me a similar argument where a while American woman **Rachel Anne Dolezal** identified herself as black and for years adopted the culture and framed an body appareance. The Blacks incidentally are not too happy as they have a term **""Blackfishing ""** for it**.**  

The argument that ""Whether her father does or doesn’t identify as Malay is a moot point, because we’re talking about her, not her daddy."" seems illogical. Choosing to abandon one's race and culture is one thing but claiming to be member of another is quite another.  

I would have thought that a better argument is that she was raised mainly by her mother whose is a Malay with all trappings of the Malay culture rather than claim of allowing someone to have a choice of identifying oneself with another race.",singapore,t3_dga8c2

Graduated in college last year and got my diploma in Interior Design and have been looking for a job using my Long-Term Visit Pass ever since. The LTVP is expiring this month.

Finally got into training in a new company last month and they broke out the news last week that MoM rejected my pass and says that I'm not eligible, but I'm choosing to finish up my training here anyways.

The company is confused to why they rejected my pass, since MoM won't state a reason why. Has any foreigners here experienced the same thing? And I'm even more confused since it states on the SAT that I am indeed eligible for an S-Pass. 

Can anyone please help direct me to what I can or should do next? I'm telling everyone I'm okay but honestly I can feel myself breaking down inside. I have a clear plan to work in Singapore for a few years and hv a future here with my SO of 5 years, and now everything seem to crumble up and I'm terrified to move on and just confused.

"Food for thought: ""A minority-race poet is involved in publishing material that the government of the day considers offensive..."" ""A minority-race poet is involved in publishing material that the government of the day considers offensive.

Words are bandied about publicly as accusations - ""left-wing"", ""socialist"", ""English-educated"".

Elsewhere, Chinese students riot in the streets. The government draws links between these two separate incidents.

The poet is arrested along with his associates and put on trial.

The university defends him and even pays his bail.

(One of his seniors will later make the case that their trial was accidental - the offensive material was actually ghostwritten by the seniors but they had to take exams so they let the juniors do it.)

He is defended by a young lawyer who subscribes to their work, who brings in a foreigner to help defend him - both work pro bono.

The young lawyer helps the poet and his friends crowdsource for funds. Foreign politicians, including the soon-to-be PM of Malaysia, send in money to contribute to the defence.

A young newspaper journalist writes several articles supporting the poet and his friends. He defiantly titles his column ""I write as I please"". He is called in for questioning by the government.

The defense is successful and the poet and friends are acquitted.

The young lawyer becomes incredibly popular as a result of this, leading directly to him forming a political party in the same year, with the young journalist and several of the poet's friends.

The poet is Edwin Thumboo.

The senior is SR Nathan.

The journalist is S Rajaratnam.

The lawyer is Lee Kuan Yew.""

&gt; 2. For protesting in front of Parliament House against the govt's lack of action on climate change - she would be arrested, because even a one-person public protest here is regarded as an illegal assembly, and her protest sign would be seized by the police.

&gt; 3. Govt-controlled mainstream media will do a hack job on her, painting her as some sort of destabilising agent, with insinuations that she is paid by foreigners.

&gt; 4. Pro-govt trolls will attack her viciously online - accusing her of being ungrateful and ignorant (see, PM Lee already said $100b will be spent on fighting climate change in S'pore!), that she is being paid by foreigners, or at least is a willing pawn of foreign agents who want to destabilise Singapore, that she should have made use of Speaker's Corner instead of striking in front of Parliament as a stunt.

&gt; 5. Ex-MPs from the ruling party will write to the govt-controlled media/press to slam her, accusing her of wanting to bring ""western-style democracy"" to Singapore.

&gt; 6. Ministers will make speeches about foreign interference, citing her as a negative example, questioning who is funding her.

&gt; 7. She will be charged in court for her protest, or she will be issued a ""stern warning"" by the authorities.

&gt; 8. Greta will, under such intense pressure, then issue a public apology, and pledge never to walk outside the straight and narrow again.

&gt; 9. And then all will be silent, and peaceful in Singapore.

I know friends who are clinically depressed, diagnosed with anxiety, and Asperger's/autism spectrum, but I honestly can't think of anyone I know personally who has been diagnosed with ADHD other than my brother.

Any information or helping to point me in the right direction is appreciated. Thank you!",singapore,t3_deyskh

"Is there a time limit to when I can convert foreign driving license to Singapore driving license?I want to convert my foreign driver’s license to Singapore driver’s license. Am on dependent pass and have been living here three years. 

Getting a lot of conflicting information from website. 

TP website says I need to prove I was living in another country for at least six months out of 12 months, but it doesn’t say it has to be immediately prior to applying for the conversion of license. 

Other websites some say that it has to be done within 12 months of moving here, and others say no need. 

Does anyone with personal experience know if I can still convert the license even though I’ve already been living here three years? I don’t want to waste time doing the basic theory test if I’m unable to convert now.

"Wildlife in Singapore; Part 48: Mangrove WhistlerHi r/singapore, this week I'll be talking about another species of bird that is the sole representative of its family in Singapore, the [Mangrove Whistler](https://singaporebirds.com/species/mangrove-whistler/).

Like the Golden-bellied Gerygone (which I talked about [last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/db5bl7/wildlife_in_singapore_part_47_goldenbellied/)), the Mangrove Whistler is an insectivore that forages in the treetops. It's a small, plain-looking brown bird [with a distinctive song](https://www.xeno-canto.org/447967). However, while the Golden-bellied Gerygone is a common, widespread species that has readily adapted to urban areas, the Mangrove Whistler is much rarer, and has a very restricted distribution. It usually lives in mangroves and other coastal vegetation, although it is sometimes found inland, in wooded areas and abandoned rubber plantations.

For some time, [the only publicly accessible location](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/10-rare-resident-bird-species-in-singapore-and-where-to-best-find-them/) in Singapore where birdwatchers could reliably [find the Mangrove Whistler](https://flic.kr/p/9kVyLJ) was [Pulau Hantu](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2018/02/26/nss-blue-and-green-survey-22-feb-2018/). Given the tiny size of Pulau Hantu, the population of Mangrove Whistlers [living there](https://fryap.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/grey-thickheads-at-ghost-island/amp/) is very small. Pulau Tekong is apparently a stronghold for this species, but needless to say, visiting that island is out of the question for most birdwatchers. It has also been found on occasion [on Pulau Semakau](https://flic.kr/p/bpGwPU), with the most recent record taking place during a bird survey [in August 2018](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2018/09/23/singapore-bird-report-august-2018/).

In the Southern Islands, besides Pulau Hantu and Pulau Semakau, in the 1980s, the species was known from Pulau Ayer Merbau (one of the smaller islands that now makes up Jurong Island), as well as Pulau Pawai, Pulau Senang, and Pulau Sudong (the three islands that the SAF uses as a military training area and live-firing zone). Just like with Pulau Tekong, visiting these islands today to verify the continued survival of the Mangrove Whistler is extremely difficult, if not next to impossible, for members of the public.

In the north, besides Pulau Tekong, the Mangrove Whistler is known to occur on Pulau Ubin, with more sightings taking place [in recent years](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2017/10/04/singapore-bird-report-september-2017/).

The Mangrove Whistler has vanished from various sites in mainland Singapore where it was historically present, such as Jurong Lake, Khatib Bongsu, Kranji, Loyang, and Simpang. Sadly, even populations in apparently protected areas aren't necessarily secure; the last sighting of this species in Sungei Buloh was in September 2001. Although there have been several sightings in some locations the last decade, records remain scattered and sporadic. In the east, it was recorded from the reclaimed land at Changi East [in January 2015](https://www.nss.org.sg/report/ac1fd3a6-2Singapore%20Bird%20Report%20-%20Jan%202015.pdf)), [Tampines Eco Green in July 2015](https://besgroup.org/2015/08/07/mangrove-whistler-spotted-at-tampines-eco-green/), and [Pasir Ris Park in July 2016](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/singapore-bird-report-july-2016/). In the south, a lone bird was seen at Marina East in [July 2017](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2017/08/05/singapore-bird-report-july-2017/). Most recently, a Mangrove Whistler [showed up for several days](https://flic.kr/p/2h5rpwu) at [Jurong Eco Garden](https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/177185201) in [August this year](https://singaporebirdgroup.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/singapore-bird-report-august-2019/).

Just like the Golden-bellied Gerygone, the Mangrove Whistler is the only representative of its family that lives in mainland Southeast Asia; the family it belongs to, the Pachycephalidae, mostly comprise species that live east of the [Wallace Line](https://www.asiangeo.com/heritage/wallace-line-kangaroo-meets-monkey/), in Australia, New Guinea, and various island groups of the South Pacific, as well as Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands and Maluku Islands of Indonesia. Only three members of this family can be found west of the Wallace Line, with the Mangrove Whistler having the widest range, stretching from the coasts of northeastern India and Bangladesh to the Andaman Islands, Myanmar, Thailand, Indochina (where it is also found inland in the Tonlé Sap region of Cambodia), Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Bali, and Lombok, as well as Palawan in the Philippines.

"Singaporeans and the Hong Kong ProtestI am from Hong Kong and had noticed on Facebook that many Singaporeans are passionately against the protest that is happening in Hong Kong. Many of them relate very strongly with China and seem to absolutely hate the fact that we are defying authority. I had previously thought that Singapore, being quite similar to Hong Kong geographically and economically, and also given its history of striving for self-determination (I'm not too familiar with this actually), that people there would be able to somewhat sympathize with what's happening in Hong Kong.  So I would like to get some insights from local Singaporeans here.

\--------- 

1. If you are a Singaporean- Chinese, how do you view your cultural heritage in relation to China?
2. Is the population's opinion on China positive? 
3. Is the media coverage of the protest there generally pro-HongKonger or pro-Beijing?
4. Is there a divide between the older and younger generation on their views of the Singaporean government?",singapore,t3_defi3q

"Is it normal for police to guilt trip people to come to the police station for interviews?I am posting here because r/asksingapore is very inactive.

I recently reported an e-crime to the police. I had 2 phone conversations with 2 separate policemen who followed up with me about the case on the same day of the reporting (5 days ago). I am very appreciative of the first 2 police officers as they were very understanding about my case and their prompt response was excellent.

Just today I received another call from a third different police officer, asking about the case, and if I could come down to be interview regarding the case. However I currently live in school, a long way from the police station, and I am currently having exams. Moreover, I have classes to attend every day from 9 to 8 and the breaks in between classes are insufficient time to go down if not I will miss class.

I told the police officer, but rather than working to arrange a common timing this weekend, she still insisted on me coming down on the weekdays, saying things like,

""you were having exams but you still chose to make the police report around this time..?"", ""you know I would like to follow up with this case ASAP..."",""I mean you can come out of school to the police station right..? It will only take an hour.."" (no, it will take 3+ hours considering the travel time from school to the police station).""I mean the police want to work on this case but we need more information...""(but all the information and evidence, I had already fully given to the police????)

Moreover, she kept asking me basic details about the case that I had already mentioned in my report, and to the other 2 police officers. She also asked me very difficult questions like, ""how do you think this is a crime?"" and ""what do you think the police officers can do?"" I know for a FACT that what had happened was definitely a crime, but I was unsure of what to do hence I went to the police officers in the first place to ask about it??? What kind of question is this?

I am beginning to question if the person that called me was even a police officer in the first place... are all these things normal for a police officer to say to a citizen..? Apologies as this is my first time reporting something to the police and I am unsure of all these procedures.

Edit: I tried to offer to come down today in exchange for some letter to show my teachers that I was away for something urgent, she said she could not do it. I tried to offer a fixed timing on the weekend or on friday after my exams for me to come down to the station, she also declined.

"Megathread: Resources for Anti-extradition protest 2019If you are traveling to [Hong Kong](http://www.discoverhongkong.com):
 
Edit on Oct 4 - Emergency ordinance invoked, anti mask law to be enforced starting tonight at midnight. Situation is volatile, possible massive and disruptive protesting in all districts and no longer limited to weekends. Precautions advised while traveling to HK. 


Note that most of the city is still very safe for all kinds of tourist activities. In fact, due to the decrease in mainland tourists, our streets are less crowded and the lines are shorter. However, if you are traveling with little ones or the elderly, you are advised to stay outside of the major protest areas. 

Most major protests are on the weekends, especially in the evening, keep updated with the protest schedule (posted below) and the live feed and avoid those areas. If you are staying in the downtown area on the island (Admiralty/ Central/ Causeway Bay), be aware that major road and/or MTR closures can happen with very little notice. Scattered protests may break out in various parts of the city (Prince Edward, Shamshuipo, Wongtaisin, etc.) with almost no advance notice but you should have plenty of time to leave when it happens. 

Avoid interactions with the police. You can seek help from black shirted protesters, first aiders or the press. Download the [MTR app](http://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/services/mtr_mobile.html) to check for station closures. [Citymapper](https://citymapper.com/?lang=en) is helpful with alternative transportation options. Keep contact info of your consulate/ embassy in you wallet in case of emergency. 

Enjoy your stay.

"Taiwan says it is absolutely impossible for it to cooperate over the surrender of murder suspect Chan Tong-kai if Hong Kong insists on trying to degrade the island's sovereignty.Taipei has accused the Hong Kong  government of using a murder case involving two Hongkongers to attempt  to degrade the island's sovereignty.   
 

The comment, from Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, comes after Taipei  said it would not accept the return of murder suspect Chan Tong-kai  unless Hong Kong provides it with more evidence of his alleged crime  through a mutual legal assistance process.  
 

Chan reportedly confessed to murdering his Hong Kong girlfriend Poon  Hiu-wing in Taipei early last year after he had fled back to the SAR. He  is expected to be released from prison on Wednesday after serving time  for a money laundering offence connected to the killing.  
 

Chan is said to be willing to surrender himself to the Taiwanese authorities after his release.   
 

But Taipei said on Monday that Hong Kong's refusal to provide  prosecutors with evidence relating to the case shows it is treating  Taiwan as though it is part of China.  
 

The Mainland Affairs Council said it is absolutely impossible for Taiwan  to accept such an arrangement and cooperate with Hong Kong.   
 

In response, executive councillor and barrister Ronny Tong said Taiwan's stance on the matter is ""total nonsense"".  
 

""There is no evidence in Hong Kong which can benefit, or contribute, to  the successful prosecution of murder in Taiwan,"" he said, without  elaborating.  
 

The SAR government says Chan cannot be extradited to ""**any other part of  the People's Republic of China**"", and the murder case was cited by Chief  Executive Carrie Lam as the reason for her now abandoned extradition  bill, which has sparked months of protests in Hong Kong

"Apple Daily reporter found tear gas fired on Oct 19 melted the road paint which is extremely rare. They suspect police might have started using tear-gas that is made in China.&amp;#x200B;

[One of the tear gas landed on the road paint, they suspect the heat produced from the tear-gas have melted the it which is extremely rare \(Apple Daily\)](https://i.redd.it/x24dodmw3st31.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

[Used tear gas collected by citizens in MongKok and nearby areas. ](https://i.redd.it/0s02a7anast31.jpg)

Yesterday (20/10), riot police fired multiple tear-gas. Based on their reporter observation, they found the explosion sounds and smell of this kind of tear gas much stronger than the ones the police previously used. There's a chance they will release more toxic substances. 

Since June, riot police have been firing tear gas frequently. They have used over 5000 tear gas. However, since UK halts sale of teargas to Hong Kong amid police brutality claims, police bought tear gas that is made in China. 

According to SCMP, police tear gas supply cannot satisfy their demand hence recently they bought tear gas from China in bulk. Same type as the ones that the PLA counter-terrorism forces are using. They claim that this type of tear gas has a faster explosive time and more concentrated smoke, which will be harder for their target to make timely response. 

Professor Hui of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, CUHK quoted the research report released by the U.S. military in 2010, has pointed that if the tear gas explode at a temperature ranges between 275-300 degree Celcius, toxic substances such as cyanide can be released.

"Young man stabbed near Nathan St in broad daylightHey reddit, I'm a foreigner visiting HK and staying in TST. Early this morning (Monday 10/21) I was walking back to my hotel near Nathan rd when I saw a young man, dressed in all black, lying on the floor bleeding from his leg and possibly upper body. I wasn't there when it happened, but a bystander said that someone stabbed him and jumped in a van and fled away. Bystanders had already called the cops and ambulance...I'm not sure how long it took for them to arrive...but they eventually did. There were no protestors on the road this morning, only remnants of the clashes from the huge protest from last night. These random acts of violence targeted at folks dressed in all blacks in broad daylight is scary AF.

\*note\* I can't be 100% sure this is related to protest.. this is merely my hypothesis.

"I am an American Born Cantonese with parents born and raised in HK, and..My family moved to America in the 80s, but were born and raised in Hong Kong. I was raised as a child from HK, with traditions, food, culture, television, everything. I didn't even learn English until I had to begin Kindergarten. I've only been back to Hong Kong once when I was 2, and we were supposed to go back Thanksgiving Week in America this year. However, my parents being extremely pro-CCP, have outright cancelled the trip, calling the protesters savages and ungrateful. It isn't the fact that I can't go back to HK this year that bothers me (that I can wait on), but rather their escalation into extremism. 

At first, it only began with sighs and disapproving comments, but then it escalated into throwing insults about the protesters, using derogatory terms,  and attacking anyone pro HK when they state their opinion. My parents have already cut ties with the other branches of family due to difference in views, with the majority of my family being proHK. We're basically just a rouge branch of the family now. As a ProHK person in a CCP household, I feel threatened and afraid to state my opinions, seeing as how harshly and abruptly my parents ended friendships and familial bonds due to difference in opinion. 

At first I didn't want to take sides, I was just horrified at the whole thing, at the CCP, at the fact that the city I consider my home (despite having not returned since I was a child) was being threatened like that. I eventually began to actively read up more and more about it to try and stay abreast of the situation in HK, since my parents were trying to feed me convoluted storied about how ""monstrous"" the protesters were, and how they were ""ungrateful brats that bite the hand that was feeding them."" I wanted something not as biased, and eventually, the more I was exposed to the situation, the more I began to support the protests. I now fully support the protests, and want HK to retain its unique cultural identity and language instead of being assimilated into the gargantuan mass that the CCP holds sway over. 

I'm very passionate about this topic now, speaking to any of my friends who would listen, retweeting news from HK, or just doing my best by spreading the news. However, again, being in a CCP household, my parents are the only ones I refuse to talk to HK about, seeing how they get whenever HK is brought up. Although I would love nothing more than to try to reach an agreement with them regarding their extremist behavior, I'm afraid of the repercussions that could happen. 

I'm at a loss. I have no idea what to do. I want to talk to them so badly about this issue and how threatened I feel as a ProHK with them, but I risk unveiling my stance. I don't want to always constantly hear proCCP and Pro Police Brutality sermons from their TVs and Computers and hear people fighting for what they believe in be belittled as such. I don't want my parents to burn anymore friendships and bonds because of a difference in opinion and stance. It's just too distressing for me. But I also don't want to risk the consequences that might come from this. 

Please, I'm lost (as the incoherent structure of my post might suggest), and would appreciate some guidance in these harrowing times.",hongkong,t3_dkxci7

But we have to be vigilant, as Hong Kongers, to not let anyone use our movement as an excuse as a free pass to be xenophobic.

Here's the thing, how can someone both care about the people oppressed by the Chinese government and tolerate any hatred toward them or mockery of them at the same time?

If you care about us and our movement, the only logical consistent action is to condemn any racism and xenophobia toward Chinese people, Chinese Americans, Hong Kongers or Hong Kong Americans. Be as angry with them as you are with the Chinese government.

"#LoveKingKong hashtag as a corporate censorship circumvention to show your supportFor decades people in heavily censored regions were using hidden messages to show their support for a good cause. Unfortunately, nowadays people in ""free"" countries cannot easily exercise their freedom of speech either. I wonder if hidden messages can be adopted on the West and help circumvent a corporations-imposed censorship.

\#LoveKingKong seems like a very casual and non-political hashtag, so it can be used without serious repercussions.

Here is an [**example tweet**](https://twitter.com/SamAI_Software/status/1186232674446401536) with an image and a hashtag #LoveKingKong.

A bolder version can be #FreeKingKong or #HelpKingKong, but not everybody will be able to retweet that.

Interestingly, since showing your love to King Kong shouldn't be punished, many fans can approach their music idols and movie stars on social media asking them to show support for King Kong with hashtags like #LoveKingKong #RetweetIfYouCare or #ProveIfYouCare.

Extra: once people showed their support with a small action and got a positive feedback, they will be more committed to do that in the future again with a bigger action.

UPDATE: If top gamers or sport super stars tell some political stuff during an interview, they can be disqualified for breaking some rules, but if they simply express their love for King Kong, then corporations won't be able to anyhow punish them without a huge public backlash. How can famous people learn about King Kong? Well, fans can deliver the message via social media.",hongkong,t3_dkyyzt

"Hong Kong Leaders Apologize to Mosque for Water Cannon HitHong Kong (AP) -- Hong Kong officials apologized to Muslim leaders Monday after riot police sprayed a mosque gate and some people nearby with a water cannon while trying to contain pro-democracy demonstrations in the semiautonomous Chinese city.
The city's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, and its police chief visited the Kowloon Mosque to say sorry to the chief imam and Muslim community leaders.
They left without commenting but the mosque leaders told reporters that the officials apologized.
""Our mosque is not damaged, nothing is done wrong. Only thing is that they should have not done it. For that they apologized so we accept it,"" said Saeed Uddin, honorary secretary of the Islamic Community Fund of Hong Kong.
During Sunday's protest, a police water cannon truck that was passing by the mosque suddenly sprayed a stinging blue-dyed liquid at a handful of people standing in front of its gate, according to video of the incident by pro-democracy lawmaker Jeremy Tam.
Tam said on his Facebook page that he and two others, neither of whom were protesters, went to hospital to check for injuries.
Local broadcaster RTHK reported that people outside the mosque were there to guard it.
Hong Kong authorities scrambled to minimize the fallout from the incident, which protesters seized on as the latest example of what they call unnecessarily harsh police tactics.
Police used the water cannon along with tear gas and pepper spray to battle protesters who remained on the streets after the end of an unauthorized rally calling for broader political rights and police accountability, in the latest turmoil to grip the financial center since early June.
Hong Kong is home to more than 300,000 Muslims, according to the Islamic Community Fund, which runs the city's five mosques and two Muslim cemeteries.
Police said Sunday the spraying was an accident and sent representatives to meet with mosque leaders.
""It is most unfortunate that the dispersal operation has caused unintended impact on the Kowloon Mosque,"" the force said on its Facebook page.",hongkong,t3_dkvsrq

"My thoughts on the protests as a person living in Hong Kong.I now can’t remember when the protests first started, its been so long, and yet people are still fighting for what they believe in. 

I’ll readily admit that I’m in a rather privileged financial position, but I still wholeheartedly support the protestors and their ideals. What they’re doing is a fight for human rights, and for a greater life for younger generations and the middle-class alike. 

However, I’m in the minority in the more privileged people around me. They tell me that they don’t support the violence that the protestors are undertaking, and adopt an “anti-violence” stance, but I rarely see them deflecting this back to the police, which leads me to believe that the conservative values of those people around me think that maintaining the status quo is for the best for them, i.e. an “I don’t give a fuck, stop bothering me” type mindset, instead of truly believing in being against violence.

My family frequents TVB, and all they see is the violence of the protests, and I never see any peaceful assembly nor do I see police violence often (hooray for corporate media)

My classmates always talk about the violence of such protestors, and the incidents they use such as the neck slashing of the policewoman, and such to justify their views. (I understand that these individual incidents really don’t degrade the movement of the whole, but it’s just sad that they’re happening)

I’ll admit, I don’t like the use of violence either, and I don’t think the people I listed above would either. However, I feel that the distinction between them and me is that focusing on the violence is a dangerous step into logical fallacy, especially when peaceful protests are happening practically in the same city. 

Furthermore, I understand that the lack of better options is a serious point that people around me are missing. Looking back to the 2014 Protests as well as protests in France, Barcelona, as well as a variety of other countries, I find that it’s hard to find a better option than trying to get a reaction or concession from the government. 

I know that everyone around me has every right to condemn the protestors, as freedom of speech allows you in Hong Kong, but it doesn’t help in offering an alternative to people who think that the government and police are an incompetent entity. I don’t have a alternative either.

"Canada is Voting Tomorrow. We have compiled a comprehensive analysis of the parties and candidates to see where they stand on Hong Kong!One day till the election. **So who should you vote for?**

After countless hours of compiling responses and findings from multiple campaigns, here is our verdict.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**---- Our Summary ----**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**|| Liberal Party Response ||**  
Of all the responses from major political parties, **the Liberal Party response has been the weakest**. There has been no mention of Hong Kong or China by Justin Trudeau during the campaign. The Liberal Party also has not mentioned or commented on specific policies such as sanctions that could protect Hong Kong.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Certain Liberal Party candidates have indicated sympathy** for the Hong Kong protesters. However, in our experience, we have found Liberal Party candidates the most difficult to get a response from. **Some Liberal Party candidates have also indicated they are sympathetic to the Chinese government**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**|| Conservative Party Response ||**  
At the leadership level, **the Conservative Party has given the strongest stances and statements against the Chinese government and in support of Hong Kong**. Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has proposed withdrawing Canada’s investment in the PRC-led Asia development bank and reassessing Canada’s trade relationship with the PRC. At several rallies, Andrew Scheer also has pledged support for the Hong Kong protesters and has stated that he would **impose sanctions to help protect Hong Kong**.  
&gt;  
&gt;The responses from **individual candidates have been mixed**. The majority of Conservative candidates supports the Hong Kong protesters. However, for certain ridings, and especially in places like Vancouver, **there are candidates who are sympathetic to the Chinese government**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**|| NDP Response ||**  
**The NDP has largely been supportive of the Hong Kong protesters**. On the campaign, they haven’t mentioned any specific policies they would implement to help the Hong Kong protesters but did respond that they **would support Magnitsky Act sanctions**. We found their candidates were **fairly responsive** to the issue with many of them pledging support for Hong Kong and refusing to accept gifts from foreign parties.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**|| Green Party Response ||**  
At both the leadership and candidate level, the **Green Party has been very sympathetic** to the Hong Kong protest movement. They have also been the most accessible in terms of getting responses to the issue. However, beyond sympathy and stressing that they advocate for human rights, the Green Party **has not mentioned supporting any substantial policies** that would actually protect Hong Kong.

Here we are, over a week later and you see tons of bank branches, food outlets under the maxim umbrella and best mart 360 being continuous targets of vandalism and destruction with no end in sight.

Where is the action against Apple? Why do protesters, I assume, keep using iPhones? Why is there no vandalism on the Apple store fronts or any move boycott them?

Sure you can say that best mart has affiliations with the triad, and Annie Wu condemned the protesters and is clearly Pro-China but maxim has already made a statement distancing them from her remarks, which protesters ignore. The targeted banks are state owned yes but what have they said this whole time? If we're targeting companies based on their state owned nature why are we limiting the acts toward them?

Some weeks ago, it was just something people would talk about every now and then, somehow finding a place in students' conversation. Now? It is amazing to see how deep the marches have grown with us, it's not just a spell of thought anymore, it is the thought. My teachers, fellow students, my parents, all tantalized by one of the greatest feat of resistance against an army of arrogant tyrants, a brave exercise of rights that most of the world seems to have forgotten about, until the people of HK turned the tables on fear tactics and mass silencing. We, Filipinos (at least most of my community), who so made it clear through a bloodless revolution that we don't want a dictator crashing the economy and the nation's soul back in the day, are again inspired by the actions of a courageous few turned millions steadfastly protecting the nation they cherish.

Beyond all the gritty details, beyond Beijing's propaganda behemoth, and beyond the state police (protecting the gov't more so than it's people, really, those creeps remind of Half Life's civil protection), the world's heart goes out to you HKers.

Hong Kong is a bright history in the making. Keep on fighting HK, the world marches with you!

"Question regarding Cathay Pacific flightsHi all,

I'm planning a trip to SE Asia (most likely Tokyo, but we haven't fully decided) for March 2020, and have noticed many flights out of Toronto with Cathay Pacific that transit through HK. This is the case for a lot of different destinations I've played around with in Expedia/Google flights, and the prices are usually the most reasonable.
I know I will absolutely not fly a Chinese airline- we did that last year to go to Bali and flew with China Eastern and had a 23 hour layover in Shanghai. It was interesting, but we decided then and there that China just wasn't for us. That is especially the case now, as both my husband and I are huge supporters of your cause and plan to never step foot in China again. 

My concern isn't about the airport or transiting though HK, as I know it's generally safe- my concern is that I don't want to support an airline that is possibly pro HKPF or corrupt in any way. I thought I saw a post a while back about companies that are siding with CCP/HKPF and I feel like Cathay was on it (among a lot of other airlines tbh, so I might have to get a little creative...) 

If anyone can confirm this, it would be a great help. Also, I haven't ruled out visiting HK entirely. Been following this sub for the majority of the protests and admiring the courage and strength you all have, from Canada. HK has been on our travel bucket list for a long time and I've read that it's generally safe for tourists provided we stay away from protests. 

Anyways, I've rambled enough- stay safe friends! Thanks for any insight!",hongkong,t3_dkp46x

"Book DedicationPeople all around the world are showing solidarity with your cause. As someone who barely leaves his house, I figured all I could ever do was just upvote everything. But this forum has made me realise that it’s important to speak up for what is right, regardless of how small your voice is. I write books, they’re not super well known but they should reach maybe a hundred or so people. On the first page of each one will be the same message: I support HK.

I think HK, and its people, are truly inspirational. More than that- this movement is crucial. You have shown that, with decency and determination and humanity, you can and will stand up for what is right even in the face of so much wrong. To stay true to your path and not be bullied from it; to rise and refuse to be brought down to the same disgusting level of those in power… it’s magnificent. This is the first forum I check in the morning and the last I check at night. HK has done the world proud.

So, this is my small gesture for you guys. Good luck on the streets and stay safe HKers. We’re all cheering for you.

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer has proposed withdrawing Canada’s investment in the PRC-led Asia development bank and reassessing Canada’s trade relationship with the PRC. At several rallies, Andrew Scheer also has pledged support for the Hong Kong protesters and has stated that he would **impose sanctions to help protect Hong Kong**.  
The responses from **individual candidates have been mixed**. The majority of Conservative candidates supports the Hong Kong protesters. However, for certain ridings, and especially in places like Vancouver, **there are candidates who are sympathetic to the Chinese government**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**|| NDP Response ||**  
**The NDP has largely been supportive of the Hong Kong protesters**. On the campaign, they haven’t mentioned any specific policies they would implement to help the Hong Kong protesters but did respond that they **would support Magnitsky Act sanctions**. We found their candidates were **fairly responsive** to the issue with many of them pledging support for Hong Kong and refusing to accept gifts from foreign parties.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**|| Green Party Response ||**  
At both the leadership and candidate level, the **Green Party has been very sympathetic** to the Hong Kong protest movement. They have also been the most accessible in terms of getting responses to the issue. However, beyond sympathy and stressing that they advocate for human rights, the Green Party **has not mentioned supporting any substantial policies** that would actually protect Hong Kong.

"Why Hong Kong democratic movement is doomed?There are 2 BIG reasons:

**First reason is lack of clarity on what rights are and where they come from.**  Are rights given by god, by society or by nature? The problem is  that none of this can be proven.  One’s answers to these questions determine whether one is capable of defending a free society. If one does not know the nature and source of rights, one cannot know whether rights are real or imagined. And if rights are not real, there is no foundation for freedom; governments and societies may do as they please. 

Hong Kong people urgently need a observation based theory of Rights that can be demonstrated true with facts and they need to explain this to the world.: [Theory of rights](https://www.theobjectivestandard.com/2011/08/ayn-rand-theory-rights/) 

**Second reason is use of Violence against police and other pro-Chinese businesses.** This has back fired terribly and caused Hong Kong to loose international support which it needs badly.. The Chinese are using such footage to strengthen their case and get support from international community. Don't give them any opportunities.

Whats a more effective alternative to violence?  **Reason.** Understand properly what are rights and how you know it. Talk to students, businesses, governments, youtube, facebook, twitter. Explain them if they want to live a human life, they need to understand what rights are in way that is demonstrably true.  

Before protest marches, get everyone to agree on 100% Non-violence like movements organised by Gandhi in India and Martin Luther king in America. If there are attacks from the police, dont fight back. Instead record it and put in on the internet.  You will get support from the whole world.

In this fight, Hong Kong's  win and loss against China is going to impact the future of not just Hong Kong but the whole world. I admire those who are out their fighting and supporting Hong Kong but please do it with full understanding of nature of rights and without violence. Like India and Black people in America, you will achieve full freedom not matter what the odds are.

Thank you for doing this.",hongkong,t3_dkziz5

"American's that support Hong Kong, lets put together a list of businesses that we should support as alternatives to companies that support China!As an American, I feel horrible that I cant do more to support Hong Kong.  I wanted to ask if other Americans could come together and list products that do not help China's cause, if not minimize how much it helps China's cause.

I know this is really difficult to do as its become almost a standard business practice to have labor outsourced to China or parts manufactured in China that are then brought to the USA but ultimately contribute to China.  But I wanted to ask if we could get together and list companies that have products available in USA that could reduce our footprint and ideally repost this link to anyone that is similarly having difficulty purchasing products that aren't supporting China.  I'm aware that I'm probably asking people to spend a bit more than they normally would for a product of similar quality that's manufactured in China, but I just want to at least explore this as much as I can.  Personally, I'm someone with a bit more of a disposable income than most and if nothing else, I'd like to be able to do what I can, even though the impact may not be significant.

I don't expect to completely remove my own reliance on products manufactured in China, just because it doesn't seem possible at the moment, but if I can at least reduce my footprint then I hope its a step in the right direction.  I know a lot of people have pessimistic responses to the notion of boycotting Chinese made products but I think we can at least *try*, right?

- [Here is a subreddit I found which seems...kind of dead](https://old.reddit.com/r/madeinusa/)...but it seems it exists to support products that are made in USA.

- [Allen Edmunds](https://www.allenedmonds.com/) seems like a good alternative for those that are perhaps purchasing business casual clothes.  I recently found that L.L. Bean and Patagonia, while formerly manufactured in USA, now have started manufacturing in China.  Perhaps we can use this store as an alternative?  I believe the pricing in somewhat similar.

- [Barbasol](https://barbasol.com/).  Men of reddit, I know perhaps we like getting fancier products for shaving but Barbasol has a long history of being an American-made product.

- [Made in America](https://www.madeinamerica.co/).  These guys seem to sell a variety of products all made in America, as the name would suggest.  Perhaps look at this as a sort of Walmart alternative.

- [American Plastic Toys](https://americanplastictoys.com/retailers/).  When you have to purchase toys this Christmas for your kids or as gifts for others, maybe consider buying from this company instead?  [Here is their storefront on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/AmericanPlasticToys/Homepage/page/1826A447-DCB8-4533-83B2-688322E894D6)

- [Ubisoft](https://uplay.ubisoft.com/) instead of Blizzard.  Blizzard notoriously felt a big backlash because it banned players supporting Hong Kong.  I wanted to point out Ubisoft as a potential alternative.  I know this is weird for a creative medium to offer up an alternative, but I think its worth noting that Ubisoft was pressured to censor their video games, faced backlash from its audience and then stood with its audience instead of kowtowing to China.  Perhaps when the holidays roll around this year, you buy your friends/relatives a Ubisoft gift card if you were perhaps otherwise going to buy a Blizzard one?

- [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/) - CEO Tim Sweeney made a statement on twitter claiming that the company will not take action against players who voice support for the Hong Kong protests

Does anyone have any others that they can provide sources of information that it does not ultimately contribute to China, if not, minimizes contributions to China from other sources.

"I taught a long uncensored lesson on HK today (I'm a teacher on the mainland- Chinese students).The reactions were interesting and gave me hope.

We talked about a number of things: 

- relativism and its use as a rhetorical tool for people who didn't want to engage with uncomfortable positions.

- measuring the truth of different narratives by how well they predict what eventually happens (ie if we show strength or give economic concessions the protests will stop). 

- how informed the students thought they were about the protests.

- A timeline of the protests, demands and escalations 

- my own experiences with mainlander attacks/threats on peaceful protests &amp; journalists in Australia

- my own experiences on the streets in HK: peaceful &amp; violent protests, police tendency towards undisciplined violence, general support for protests, young protestor's tendency towards emotive, untargeted violence, intimidation of innocent mandarin speakers

- the may 4th movement, communist revolution and student violence in both

- to what extent can violence be a legitimate tactic?

- what options the ccp has had open to it? 

- has ccp decision making solved the problem?

The kids did really well. Almost all showed real excitement at getting uncensored information or being subversive. Some looked for ways to assimilate new information within their existing narrative while others showed real sympathy for protestors. Most were critical of ccp social media &amp; a number were outright critical of govt decision making. Some retreated into learned helplessness and apathy. Almost all were disgusted by mainland student behavior in the west but remained extremely worried by protestor rhetoric against Chinese people rather than the govt.

My point in sharing this is that many people on here complain about mainlanders being hostile and uninformed about HK, while simultaneously being hostile and uninformed about mainlanders.

The kids reactions were just like any group of people- varied. In fact, once they had basic information to deal with they were hugely more sympathetic than I expected. Its something to be hopeful about. 

While i know how difficult it is, I genuinely think more thought has to be put into how to encourage these sympathies. It's easy to be against the CCP- but beating them will take more than just being angry.

----

    Date: October 20th, Sunday
    Gathering Time: 3:00 pm
    Gathering Location: Roundhouse Park (Next to Toronto Railway Museum)
    Marching Time: 4:00 - 5:30pm

*Please join our Telegram channel: https://t.me/antielab_toronto for event details and live updates

The Chinese Communist Party has always rejected the notion of freedom of expression, a fundamental principle for many of us in the West. For a long time, we have overlooked their transgressions for these incidents were happening halfway across the world. But over the past few weeks, companies like Blizzard and the NBA have shown us that Chinese censorship has already reached our shores. This attack on our freedom can no longer be ignored. When international corporations and politicians can be bought by a tyrannical government, it is up to the people to speak out against such blatant suppression and prevent the erosion of our basic freedom of speech. 

Beyond their continued assault on Hong Kong’s freedoms, a city that houses the second largest overseas Canadian population, China has also launched a direct attack on the citizens of Canada. When the Canadian government refused to release the CFO of Huawei, Meng Wanzhou, after she was accused of both espionage and violating sanctions placed on Iran, the Beijing Bureau proceeded to detain two of our own, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in direct retaliation for our perceived insolence. Our two Michaels are still sitting, alone, in a Chinese prison. This government needs to do more in their efforts to free these two unjustly held Canadians. We refuse to participate in China’s hostage diplomacy. 

If you feel that Canadians should be able to have the liberty to object, to think and speak, free from the political and economic pressures of foreign nations demanding our submission, to keep our government free from CCP coercion, free from any Beijing-friendly politicians in the upcoming federal elections, please join us at this rally. We will show the world that Canadian rights and freedoms are not for sale. We refuse to grant them our silent, obedient consent. As Canadians, we support democracy, freedom, human rights, and the rule of law, because we believe and understand power should belong to the people. We stand with the people of Hong Kong in their fight for freedom, freedoms that Canadians also hold dear to their hearts. 
In Canada, we will NEVER back down from intimidation and bullying from foreign nations. 
 
Fight for Freedom! Our thoughts can’t be bought!

* Save Hong Kong, Pass the Act. Referring to the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act currently in the US Congress.

**Common Mistranslations**

Please be careful of the following English to Chinese mistranslations:

* Free Hong Kong is sometimes mistranslated as 免費香港/免费香港. This is wrong because 免費/免费 means ""not costing money"" not ""liberate/emancipate"". Please use 光復香港
* Liberate Hong Kong is sometimes mistranslated as 解放香港. This can be misinterpreted because 解放 are the first two characters in 解放軍 or China's People Liberation Army (PLA). We do NOT want the PLA to invade Hong Kong so please use 光復香港
* Democracy Now is sometimes translated as 現在民主/现在民主. This is grammatically awkward. Please use 實行真普選 which means ""implement genuine universal suffrage"". This refers to true universal suffrage where China cannot choose or disqualify candidates.

**Flags**

The protest movement has two general flag designs with slight variations:

* Black Bauhinia. Hong Kong flag but black and sometimes wilting to show that the government is causing the death of the city. [Multiple versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bauhilia_extradition.png). [Bloodied version](https://i.redd.it/rpit9ei6fx331.jpg). [Stars replaced by dots version](https://imgur.com/gallery/sPo5B32).
* 光復香港, 時代革命. See above for explanation. [Version 1](https://i.redd.it/emdstrgpu7i31.jpg). [Version 2](http://scd.cn.rfi.fr/sites/chinese.filesrfi/dynimagecache/0/4/600/339/1024/578/sites/images.rfi.fr/files/aefimagesnew/aef_image/08c16bc5003a67afb83898fe44a09fad-600x400.jpg).

**Other symbols**

* Masks. Used to hide identity, show solidarity with the movement and protest the mask ban that was implemented by circumventing legislative process. Black masks are preferred but surgical masks and full face coverings with other messages are also great. A great example: [https://i.redd.it/23n2q6fqcft31.jpg](https://i.redd.it/23n2q6fqcft31.jpg)
* 願榮光歸香港. ""Glory to Hong Kong"". An anthem written specifically for Hong Kong during this movement. It is commonly sung at protests. [MV1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt1O5enixdw). [MV2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUIDL4SB60g). [MV3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHOZuIO5G2s). [English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXZNOecZreY). [Japanese](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uYJ0Mgva4E). [Instrumental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1Qy-WHErOE). [Multiple languages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y5JOd7jWqk). [Sign language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQDUjVOZBgk).
* Holding up five fingers to represent the 5 demands. Example from same pic: [https://i.redd.it/23n2q6fqcft31.jpg](https://i.redd.it/23n2q6fqcft31.jpg)
* [\#eye4HK](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/19/62/5c/19625cd6a7248120497de46633f63f1e.jpg). After a beanbag round hit a first aider in the right eye, people began to cover their right eye to show solidarity and protest police brutality. Still commonly done on the streets during protests. For more info on the incident, please check out this article: [https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/22/eye4hk-campaign-support-hong-kong-protesters-gains-international-momentum/](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/22/eye4hk-campaign-support-hong-kong-protesters-gains-international-momentum/)
* Yellow Umbrellas and Yellow Ribbons. Symbols carried over from the 2014 Umbrella Movement for genuine universal suffrage. Supporters of the democracy movement are sometimes called ""yellow ribbons"" or ""yellow shirts"" while supporters of the establishment are sometimes called ""blue ribbons"" or ""blue shirts"".

**Used by both sides of the movement**

The following are used by both sides of the protest movement. They will be understood in context but the above options are better.

* Support Hong Kong. 支持香港. Pro-government parties also say to ""support Hong Kong"" so the intention is vague. If you wish to express this sentiment, 香港人加油 for Hong Kongers add oil is better. You can also use &lt;insert group here&gt; 撐香港 because 撐 is not commonly used in mandarin so the CCP will not use it. Example from [Taiwan](https://www.rfa.org/mandarin/yataibaodao/gangtai/hcm-06162019090415.html/4e0a842c4eba53cd90014e2d4e00.jpeg/@@images/8654e9b6-ff4e-4afd-bc3f-6e5b30981d5e.jpeg).
* The Hong Kong SAR flag. Anti-protesters wave the Chinese and HK SAR flag as well. Both the red color and the five stars on the petals of the bauhinia flower are symbols to match the Chinese flag. This flag is not waved in protests in Hong Kong but if we see people abroad use it, we understand that they are trying to show support and appreciate it.

Hong Kong uses traditional Chinese characters while mainland China uses simplified Chinese characters. If your primary goal is to show support for Hong Kong, please use traditional Chinese. If your primary audience is mainland Chinese people, then feel free to use simplified. If you are not sure which you are using, check on google translate by trying Chinese &gt; Chinese(traditional) and Chinese &gt; Chinese(simplified).

Hopefully this is helpful. Thank you for your support!",hongkong,t3_dk5510

"Sign petition to extend US Country of Origin marking requirements to digital retailershttps://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/extend-country-origin-marking-requirements-digital-retailers

This is indirectly related to Hong Kong, but I believe it is important because it is related to what Hong Kong is currently going through. I believe many Americans would boycott China of their own accord if they had the information available to them. I do not want my money going toward oppressive communist regimes.

I have been boycotting China for about 10 years now, and the hardest thing about doing so is the fact that digital retailers are preventing us from seeing where the products we purchase are made. The current Country of Origin law only applies to labeling physical items, but does not require digital retailers like Amazon from putting it on product pages.

This makes it impossible to make informed decisions before purchasing products, which is the reason the existing law is in effect.

"TLDR: What is happening in Hong Kong?Friend of mine wrote this little summary for people who have just joined us here. Please give him some love at his tumblr: [https://twoohugs.tumblr.com/](https://twoohugs.tumblr.com/) . Please reply here for translations and questions. So here goes:

For those of you who have seen posts about Hong Kong and are wondering what is happening here, I have attempted to compile a summary of the events of the past few months, how it concerns you, and how you can help.

Please, *please* spend some time to read this. Your attention and support means a lot to us. And if you can, please spread the message around.

Part I: The background and the protests

Part II: The police state: police brutality and abuse of power

Part III: Stand with Hong Kong (what you need to know, **why you should care, and what you can do**)

The information included is proven factually accurate as of 18 October. Click on the hyperlinks for additional information and video/photo proof. (To avoid triggering or gory content, no images are included in the original post.)

**Part I. The protests**

**1. A little bit of background info**

Hong Kong is a former British colony. Hong Kong Island and Kowloon was ceded to Britain under Nanking and Peking Treaties, and Britain obtained a 99-year lease of the New Territories in 1898. After its handover to China in 1997, under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong is ruled under the “One Country, Two System” principle. It has its own legal system, with control over its own trade, tax, and immigration policies that are independent from China.

As a result, Hong Kong people enjoy freedom of speech, and unrestricted internet access. The Basic Law, Hong Kong’s mini-Constitution, dictates that Hong Kong will have a high degree of autonomy for 50 years after the handover until year 2047. However, now, only 22 years later, China is already extending control over the city.

When asked to uphold their end of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, China claimed that the declaration is merely [a “historical document” that is no longer legally binding](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-anniversary-china/china-says-sino-british-joint-declaration-on-hong-kong-no-longer-has-meaning-idUSKBN19L1J1), and that no other country has any right to interfere with China’s domestic affairs.

The chief executive in Hong Kong is elected by a 1200-member committee representing only 6% of eligible voters and is composed of mainly pro-Beijing members. Activists for freedom in Hong Kong [face censorship](https://twitter.com/HongKongFP/status/1183698265570562052?s=19), as pro-democracy legislators were [screened, and even disqualified from elections](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/15/govt-asks-district-council-election-candidates-meaning-liberate-hong-kong-hopefuls-decry-political-censorship/).

**2. The spark: extradition bill**

The government proposed *the Fugitive Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019* (aka the extradition bill), which would allow extradition of fugitives to Mainland China. The government claimed that this would prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives.

Hong Kong has long been a sanctuary for political fugitives fleeing mainland China: those who speak up against the Chinese Communist Party (aka CCP). The judiciary in China is believed to be highly corrupt and unfair. Those who criticize the CCP are prosecuted, jailed, or worse, tortured or “disappeared”. Citizens fear that the bill would result in residents and visitors, or even dissidents merely transferring through Hong Kong being sent to mainland China for persecution for political reasons.

A few years ago, five missing persons [were later revealed to be abducted by China from Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay_Books_disappearances), for selling books banned in mainland China for political reasons. On 21 August this year, [a staff of the Consulate of UK was abducted within Hong Kong borders into mainland China](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/08/22/china-claims-uk-hong-kong-consulate-worker-arrested-mainland/) for allegedly “engaging with a prostitute”. Hong Kong netizens later discovered that the so-called photo proof of such crime was fabricated (They were from an unrelated article published last year). Citizens fear that if illegal “extraditions” were conducted so blatantly, legalizing such act would lead to unimaginable consequences. Thus, people went on the streets to protest.

**3. Escalation: five demands, not one less + government’s response**

(for more information: [https://hkrev.info/main\_en.php](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fhkrev.info%2Fmain_en.php&amp;t=YjRmNzRiOWEzMTQ2NzJjNjAyNmU4Y2QzOTljMTU3MTIzZDIxYTU2NixlZ05uRGFGbA%3D%3D&amp;b=t%3Adz2c9PC7_S4RYefbHsEaLA&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Ftwoohugs.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F188437205661%2Fwhat-is-happening-in-hong-kong&amp;m=1) )

On 9 June,[ there was a demonstration of more than a million people](https://www.scmp.com/video/hong-kong/3013846/more-1-million-people-join-historic-hong-kong-march-against-extradition) (1/7 of Hong Kong’s population of 7.3 million), demanding the government to withdraw the extradition bill. The government ignored the demonstration and continue the legislative process of the bill, despite objection from different sectors (including legal and finance professionals).

On 12 June, people marched again to protest against the bill. [The police fired pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets and beanbag rounds at protesters](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/13/just-restrained-hong-kong-police-say-150-rounds-tears-gas-20-bean-bag-shots-fired-anti-extradition-law-riot/), injuring at least 80 people. Many protesters were arrested, and the government categorized the incident as a riot, which allowed the police to charge any participants of the event with rioting, with carries a maximum sentence of ten years.

On 15 June, chief executive Carrie Lam [announced suspension of the bill](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/06/15/breaking-hong-kong-suspends-controversial-extradition-bill-months-protest-criticism/), but refused to withdraw it, refused compensation towards the injured citizens. and did not acknowledge the excessive force used by the police.

On 16 June, [2 million people (more than ¼ of the Hong Kong population)](https://www.scmp.com/video/hong-kong/3014716/scenes-hong-kongs-second-straight-sunday-massive-anti-extradition-bill) marched to protest against the extradition bill and the excess use of force by the police. The government offered no response to the march.

On[ 1 July](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koTdqWz77AU), some protesters entered the legislative council building, and in the process they defaced the Hong Kong emblem, smashed political symbols and left slogans on the wall, whilst leaving artifacts and the library untouched. Following this, [Carrie Lam broke her silence](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/07/02/hong-kongs-carrie-lam-condemns-protesters-occupation-legislature-extreme-use-violence/) to condemn the protesters, sparking anger from citizens, who accused her of caring more about the damaged objects than the lives of injured citizens.

Following the excess use of force by the police, as well as the deterioration of democracy and freedom in Hong Kong, with no response from the government, the demands of citizens broadened from just withdrawing the bill to **“five demands, not one less”:**

1. Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill
2. Amnesty for all arrested protesters
3. Withdrawal of the categorization of protests as “riots”
4. Independent commission of inquiry into police violence and abuse of power
5. Implementation of full universal suffrage, as set under the Basic Law

A month after the start of the protests, Carrie Lam announced that [the bill was “dead”.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/09/hong-kong-carrie-lam-says-extradition-bill-is-dead-but-stops-short-of-withdrawal) It was a non-legally binding statement aiming to give citizens the illusion that the bill was withdrew, when the bill actually only remained “suspended”.

Carrie Lam offers no response to the police’s actions, but continued to accuse the protesters of “destroying Hong Kong”, saying that the youngsters[ “have no stakes” ](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/08/09/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-rules-protest-concessions-urges-focus-economy/)in the city, and called the protesters “rioters”.

On 4th September, [Lam finally announced to “start the withdrawal process”, but refused to accept any other demands](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-49575381). In response to the demand of an independent inquiry on police misconduct, Lam announces the addition of two members to the already-proven powerless and biased IPCC (Independent Police Complaints Commission). All members of the IPCC are selected by the chief executive, and these two new members are from her own close circle. The IPCC has no legal power to investigate, but could only advice the CAPO (Complaints Against Police Office, a police department). From year 2011 to 2018, only 2 cases out of 2000 complaints of alleged police assault had been successfully substantiated.

Instead of listening to the two million people who have marched on the streets, and many more who joined other forms of peaceful protests, Carrie Lam organized a dialogue session with 150 participants, claiming that she wants to “directly communicate with the people”. However, only a selected few in the crowd were given the chance to speak during the session, and she responded to even less, only repeatedly denying all requests for the five demands.

On 4 October, Lam announced that she would[ invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance and announce the anti-mask law](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/10/04/breaking-hong-kong-officially-enacts-emergency-laws-ban-masks-protests-ngos-criticise-draconian-measure/), taking effect at midnight. She claims that the law was to prevent the protesters’ “extreme violence”.

This caused great outrage because [the use of the Emergency Regulations Ordinance](https://twitter.com/joshuawongcf/status/1166382660886728704) set a dangerous precedent. Under this ordinance, “on any occasion which the chief executive may consider to be an occasion of emergency or public danger, he/she may make any regulations whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public interest.” The CE is given **absolute power** to bypass the legislative council to introduce new laws, to censor and suppress publications and media, to arrest or deport persons, to control all means of transport (both in and out of the city), to appropriate, confiscate and control all property, to search and enter any property without a warrant, to execute curfew, etc.

[Barrister-at-law Kwok Wing-hang explained](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=526561698169410) that back in 1999, the Hong Kong government vowed to the UN that any laws introduced under the emergency regulations would pass through the legislative council. It has now broken its promise.

The anti-mask law’s implementation is also problematic. It specifies that masks are banned only during public assemblies (approved or unapproved), but the education bureau sent out memos to kindergarten and schools, forbidding children from wearing masks. This caused great protest from parents as it is not included in the law (schools are not “public assemblies”), it is unreasonable (kindergarten children are not “violent rioters”), and nonsensical, as Hong Kong is approaching peak flu and HFMD season, and banning masks could lead to mass outbreaks.

Under the anti-mask law, people are allowed to wear masks in assemblies for health and safety reasons, or if required by profession. However, the police [ignores such exceptions](https://tl.hkrev.info/en/portfolio/hk-police-raptor-squad-pushed-a-u-s-journalist-and-violently-removed-her-mask/) and [demands reporters to remove their protective masks in the midst of tear gas](http://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news.php?id=212367&amp;sid=4&amp;sid=4). They are also seen [arresting and capturing random civilians for wearing masks](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=549637005597611) even when they are not in any assemblies.

Despite escalating protests and discontent in the city, Carrie Lam insists that it is “[not feasible to relaunch a debate on universal suffrage](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3032911/not-feasible-relaunch-debate-universal-suffrage-now-hong)” and claims that answering to the protesters’ demands is pointless because “you can’t negotiate with the mob”.

After US senators [Ted Cruz](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3032677/us-senator-ted-cruz-accuses-hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam) and [Josh Hawley](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3033011/hong-kong-leader-carrie-lam-condemns-us-senator-josh-hawley) visited Hong Kong and expressed solidarity with Hong Kong people and protesters, Carrie Lam criticized them for “irresponsible” comment that were not “based on facts”, despite the senators having visited the protest areas in person, which is something Lam has never done.",hongkong,t3_dk4oug

"A Letter To Jimmy ShamDear my dearest Jimmy Sham,

America now is hollowed out

By hollow men themselves.

She’s been assaulted by a spurt 

Of characters who climax capital

And would give her to a labored death

If the delivery makes money. 

For this, we are sorry. We are

Also destitute of decency.

&amp;#x200B;

Ask it with us, then: when did

Evolution go depriving 

Man his spine? Was it because

He never did stand up to fear,

Or needed means to self-fellate?

Now he can, he need not stand,

And they can lay in beds together 

Jacking one another off 

The face of earth and onto it, 

Pooled in sticky millions of hardened cash.

&amp;#x200B;

Hong Kong will have sisters here,

But a sister to her Philomela.

Well, I shouldn’t use the canon myth:

Just know we’re also being raped 

By brother-kings in law and tongues 

Cut out for now, until the swath Pacific

Closes and we rebehold

Each other, vowing vengeance for ourselves

And sad our family humanity

Has all come down to this. 

&amp;#x200B;

But Jimmy, this is still a love note,

And I mean to confess to you

That I have seen your face on screens 

And at the front of madding crowds

And seen you hammered down by cowards

Fooled like sheep defending wolves.

We have those too, the ages do;

There will always be the sludge

Of puke to throw the men into. 

&amp;#x200B;

So Jimmy, if you hear this, hear my plea:

Who brandishes against the common

Have lost their commonality;

Those sheep will bleat their shit away

Before they grant they’re enemy;

And last, that people often hide 

Behind that mask of great Humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

Great and wonderful it is indeed

That we are all in something common,

That all eyes cry and all hearts bleed;

Or like boys like you and I like boys,

Inside that largest circle move the smaller ones.

And you can ask us gays the best

About those types of men who fight 

Against their own and will bend backwards

Over to perform the same 

Immense gymnastics of the mind 

As it would take to fuck yourself. 

I assume they also have no spine.

And I say they too do wear a mask, 

And we will be the ones upstanding

At the latter day upon the Peak Victoria

To wreak the justice for these times,

To rip the masks clean off their face.

So listen to our warning now, 

You multitude of hypocrites: 

The more aligned the mask to face

The harder it will be to peel,

And then the face you’re left is one

That’s hardly human, slushy meal, 

And you will wear your own monstrosity. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I am tired, so I’ll speak softer,  

Because I’m a thing like you

And sometimes I have felt the sadness

And the loneliness of ours,

How it is sad and tiresome

To fight so that you’re left alone.

But when I see you strong up there

Or spitting your disgust to state,

I have seen what I could worship.

I have heard the voice of nextdoor days

And felt the earthquake echo back, 

Assenting, saying there are more of us

Than institutions and their maze, 

More visions than the dollar gaze.   

&amp;#x200B;

My message is a poorer one

Than the fire envelope it came in:

Have patience with this pussy-wrested plot.

The McConnells and the Meadows here

Have put the orange suit on;

The grand old elephant is poached its ivory

And the Russians bend him over. 

America the slut-shamed slave 

Parades the highwayed human traffic 

And she’s on knees to please the pork

Of wrinkled skin and Dukes of York.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, have patience for our part.

The heat of twenty twenty rises slow,

And on the back of necks we feel

The peeping of that morning sun

When reeking publicans will face

Their reckoning for what they did 

In darkness, and all the bygone days

Will leave them not a scrap to save

A second in the kingdom come.

She is Time and she is coming to

Assume her bench and speak her sentence.

Soon enough, and we are coming too.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear my dearest Jimmy Sham,

Hear me, read me, and then let me 

Be your warrior poetry.

I am yours and will be your

American admirer forevermore.",hongkong,t3_dk9gw5

The only way to really tackle the situation, is to educate the people, the cogs of the machine are the people, if not for change now at least for change in the next generation.

&gt;On Friday, Chinese University president Rocky Tuan Sung-chi, under intense student pressure, condemned police for “any proven case” of brutality, saying he would urge Lam to launch an investigation into the treatment of about 20 arrested students.


&gt;Asked if she would condemn alleged police brutality, Lam on Saturday said: “The government will not tolerate any unlawful or violent act, including by the police … But Hong Kong’s rule of law also relies on people obeying the law, and the public should condemn people’s attacks on other residents, and vandalism of shops.”


&gt;Lam insisted that, rather than calling for a commission of inquiry in police behaviour, residents should wait for the Independent Police Complaints Council to complete its investigation into the protests and submit its report by the end of the year.

For that at least, is there proof or figures for that? Or any explicit mention of this as an issue by activists?

"How do you define an appropriate level of free speech in public places?two related questions:

* what is the ideal clearly defined rule set that allows someone to say ""free hong kong"" but not ""hong kongers are dangerous cockroaches that should be crushed""?  
I think we can agree from our basic humanity that the first statement is a force for positive good, while the second is dangerous.  
* when you control the microphone (like a news station or sporting event), and can choose who can speak through it, what's a fair and ethical rule to decide who you let speak, and who you don't?  

I want a free hong kong, but I want to have a philosophy that is fair, and not rife with the similar double standards that the CCP uses.  

Imagine you are the NBA or Blizzard, and you want to make clear and ethical rules with regard to free speech, what specifically do you want those rules to be?  What rules do you place on your players and coaches and broadcasters?  because clearly we don't want to help racists spread their message with our microphone. 

There things that make this tricky to me:

* I think it's reasonable to cut hate speech off.  
* I think it's unreasonable to enforce silence in the face of oppression, when the oppression thrives in silence
* the purpose of my broadcast is to provide interesting content for sports fans
* most political free speech is controversial without being clearly positive or negative, for instance, your theory on how to fix health care. 

I think we do a disservice to the NBA and to HK, if every single post match interview from now until the end of time is political speech, and doesn't have sports content, as much as we do a disservice to both, if an athlete is punished for voicing support to those in a humanitarian crisis.

"Civil Human Rights Front has just sent an open letter to the Appeal Board, regarding the police commissioner's objection to the rally on 20th Octoberhttps://i.redd.it/7n31lcryzdt31.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Chairman, Deputy Chairman and Members of the Appeal Board,

The police discussed in a high-profile manner about our appeal for the march at a press conference at 4pm this afternoon. This is not the first attempt of the police subjecting us to pressure but given how certain police statements discredit our intentions, we feel the need to write this letter.

Since June, members of the Appeal Board have held hearings after hearings to review multiple applications for public meetings and we would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Chairman and members of the Appeal Board.

Since July, the Appeal Board has repeatedly rejected our appeals against police objections to march or assembly for reasons of public order and safety. Despite these rejections, a large number of people have taken the risks through collectively participating in assemblies to express their political demands, and in some instances, generating police conflicts. The decision of the Appeal Board is symbolic because it can restrict freedom of speech and freedom of assembly through silencing the voice of the people, diminishing a channel for the voice of the people to be heard. This will inevitably create higher tensions within the society and heighten dissatisfaction with the police.

Freedom of expression and of assembly are guaranteed by the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Hong Kong Basic Law and Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. In the past, many common law cases have also established that the right to freedom of assembly and expression should not be unreasonably or disproportionately restricted. In preparation for applications and appeals, our lawyers relentlessly studied and reviewed case law, prepared documents to make a case in hope of being heard. However, the response of the Appeal Board often included only a few paragraphs, which neither responded to our arguments, nor the rationale or legal principles behind the decision. Despite our repeated efforts in requesting the Appeal Board to provide more information, there was no information explaining the rationale behind the decisions. Our repeated efforts to appeal is a demonstration of our belief in a civil system. However, repeated rejections without rationale have led to disappointment, not only to us, but to the credibility of the Appeal Board.

We emphasize that in every rejection of public assembly, deeper tension is embedded in society and we believe the police and the Appeal Board are accountable in the event that such rejections lead to any intense action that causes anyone to be injured, the decision makers will be accountable for blood shed.

We believe that the Appeal Board can consider different methods to ease concerns over public order and safety. Some organizers arrange audio system and expertise to ensure the safety of the public in participating in public assemblies.

We hope that the Appeal Board, with its wisdom and reason, will reconsider the decision it has reached for the march tomorrow.

"Hong Kong LawThis is all from wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Basic_Law

The region has a high degree of autonomy and enjoys executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication.[9] This means that the former judicial recourse by appealing to the United Kingdom's Judicial Committee of the Privy Council would no longer be available. Instead, the Court of Final Appeal was established within the HKSAR to take up the role.

Here is where China has broken their agreement

1. Hong Kong residents shall have, among other things, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and of publication; freedom of association, freedom of assembly, freedom of procession, of demonstration, of communication, of movement, of conscience, of religious belief, and of marriage; and the right and freedom to form and join trade unions, and to strike.[10]

2. The freedom of the person of Hong Kong residents shall be inviolable. No Hong Kong resident shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful arrest, detention or imprisonment. Arbitrary or unlawful search of the body of any resident or deprivation or restriction of the freedom of the person shall be prohibited. Torture of any resident or arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of the life of any resident shall be prohibited.[10]

3. The provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and international labour conventions as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and shall be implemented through the laws of the HKSAR.[10]

China has violated the laws of Hong Kong. 

Even if Hong Kong wins however, time is running out.

The socialist system and policies shall not be practised in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.[9]

"Why most people in Hong Kong are not seeking independenceI decided to summarize the things I've been posting multiple times on   this topic just so people can copy/paste this thread in the future   whenever this comes up. Right now there are 5 (possibly 6) demands of   the protest movement with the most important one being genuine dual   universal suffrage supported by 81.3% of people in Hong Kong \[1\]. The   movement is not primarily about independence. While there are some   ethnic issues, there are two primary reasons why:

* In 1972, China tricked the UN into making it impossible to treat Hong Kong and Macau as colonies eligible for seeking independence when every single nation there other than China would have wanted this to be possible \[2\]. Now that it is international law, other nations who  respect international law are not likely to recognize Hong Kong as   independent even if they believe it is the right thing to do.
* Hong Kong has no military and China has the ability to prevent water, electricity and food from getting into Hong Kong through naval blockades  and cutting off routes from the mainland. This is also why Hong Kong Island and Kowloon were handed over to China in 1997. Technically, these  parts of Hong Kong were permanently ceded to the United Kingdom and  only the New Territories and Outlying Islands were leased. But threats  of cutting off the water and military invasion meant that Hong Kong and   Kowloon also had to be given back to China.

As to the actual amount of people who actually support Hong Kong Independence. I can't find a reputable source for recent numbers but Chinese University found that in 2017, 11.4% of people in Hong Kong supported independence after the 50 years of no change expires in 2047. By using linear extrapolation, support for independence may be around 31.7% or 28.3% based on recent increases to 52.9% of people identifying as Hong Kongers \[3\] and 61.5% of people who are not confident in ""one country, two systems"" \[4\] respectively.

"How Hong Kong Protests are Portrayed By Different News Media Worldwide • Fake News vs. Real News •**This Russian government's state funded ""news network"" RT News is so comical to me, they would love to convince the whole world that the US has become a declining power, the US dollar is not the world's number one reserve currency, that the Chinese Yuan is and that all next generation high-tech in this planet is now being indigenously innovated in China.**

It seems laughable to me watching RT news coverage of the Hong Kong demonstrations making real hard efforts to protrait the pro-democracy movement as being demonstrations of people ""experiencing economic hardship"" confusing democracy with ""economic prosperity"" whilst at the same time accusing the demonstrators of being manipulated and funded by Western intelligent services including the CIA.

I told myself *""well which one is it? Are they confused demonstrators experiencing economic hardship or manipulated puppets of the West?""* LOL!

At the end I just said to myself what an insult to the Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrators. Portraying them of not being intelligent enough to organize themselves and accusing them of not knowing their own cause.

**China's CGTN in the other hand while just as bad if not worse than RT, does a lot better job at spreading propaganda. Perhaps because they are much better funded. Doing it a lot more tactfully and assertively.**

Their efforts being more concentrated at projecting China as a highly-developed Nation under the rule of law, and a *""responsible world leader""*, minimizing if not censoring the impact the trade war with the US has had on their economy. With it's market widely open to foreign investment where IP property protection takes highest priority.

Covering the situation in Hong Kong more or less as a *""city under siege of rioters and vandalism""*.

Even going as far as calling Xin Jiang China a *""prosperous paradise for Uighur Muslims""*. And you can forget any mentioning of ""re-education camps"". Even devoting entire segments to ""China's human rights developments"".

**It's extraordinarily unbelievable the claims networks like RT news and CGTN from China make and how far they're willing to go to misinform their domestic population and now International audiences through their multilingual news branches wich most governments where they operate consider them ""Kremlin and Beijing propaganda outlets"" rather than legitimate and credible news networks.**

**If such claims were true, 90% of all foreign business transactions worldwide would not be conducted in US dollars.**

**China has made great progress modernizing itself and deserves credit for it. With new high-tech hub cities like Shenzhen attempting to rival Silicon Valley.**

Keyword *""attempting to""*. In addition to Shenzhen, Tel Aviv Israel, Tallinn Estonia, Melbourne Australia and Toronto Canada are also considered cities rivaling Silicon Valley:

[https://www.theneweconomy.com/technology/top-5-tech-hubs-to-rival-silicon-valley](https://www.theneweconomy.com/technology/top-5-tech-hubs-to-rival-silicon-valley)

**But that isn't the important story. 90 - 95% of all the high-tech in China has been imported from abroad, rebranded and falsely claimed to have been innovated indigenously. In other words ""invented in China"". Through various means raging from forced tech transfers, intellectual property and Trade secrets theft by either cyber attacks on foreign competitor's databases, corporate spying and bribery.**

It's for these masterful intelligence operations expanding 2-3 decades, that I give China most credit for.

**As to whether American is a declining power or not depends on how a state's power is measured but most importantly how it's perceived, individually and collectively by other nations.**

What you personally believe, What region of the world you're in, which language you speak and what sources of information you have access to is actually more important than any public survey taken or any official state statistic or international ranking.

**But a most recent survey conducted by 2019 Best countries and multiple other organizations surveyed 20,000 individuals from 4 different regions around the world. And when asked to name the most powerful countries in the world taking into consideration military, political and economic influence the US came in first followed by Russia with China surprisingly in 3rd place.**

**To summarize, in this modern day in age of false news, state propaganda and politically biased misinformation campaigns the most important thing is to no longer depend on a single source of information but multiple sources of information.**

During my research I've compiled a list of reliable international news sources with at least an ""attempt to report the news with limited bias"" and report verified news with some degree of neutrality.

**My most reliable news and information sources list is:**

1 **DW News** (Germany)

2 **PBS** (U.S.)

3 **Al Jazeera** (Qatar)

4 **BBC News** (UK)

5 **France 24** (France)

6 **Wikipedia** (US) in 285 languages.

**Additionally here is a list of most unreliable, bias and heavily censored state funded international news organizations fiercely criticized for attempting to further domestic political propaganda abroad:**

1 **RT News** (Russia)

2 **CGTN** (China)

3 **CCTV** (China)

4 **TRT News** (Turkey)

5 **HispanTV / IRIB** (Iran)

**Finally, the following is a list I felt also needed to be compiled as it merits mentioning. News organizations that despite being politically biased, do report real news and events although be it spined to fit their narrative. But also exclude important and relevant news topics and/or allocate limited coverage to further their in-house political agendas:**

1 **TRT News** (Turkey)

2 **CNN News** (US Far-left)

3 **Fox News** (US Far-right)

4 **MSNBC News** (US Far-Left)

5 **Sky News Australia** (Far-right)

"Open letter of Rocky Tuan, President of Chinese University of Hong Kong (TLDR at bottom)Dear Students, Colleagues and Alumni,

My heart is heavy and unsettled as I pen this personal letter. The chaotic scenes from the media images of my meeting a week ago (10 October) with CUHK students and alumni must have shocked many.  My team and I, and every student and alumni member present at the meeting, felt the tensions and heightened emotions first-hand.  In fact, the proceedings had gotten so out of control that a meaningful dialogue became totally impossible.  At the end of the large, chaotic meeting, I had a further two-plus-hour of closed-door conversation with a smaller gathering of students, including some who were arrested for alleged offences related to the recent social unrest.  We all managed to put aside our differences, and carried on an open dialogue.  I was able to see personally and up close the pain and suffering of the students, how they were driven to a state of hopelessness, and why they had turned to the University for help.  I directly related to these students of CUHK my honest feelings and my thoughts.  I fully recognized that in the face of such unprecedented challenges to our community, the University might not have done enough for our students, even though we owe our responsibilities to many different stakeholders.  During these emotional two-plus hours, I heard loud and clear every word uttered by our students, which brought me no small share of sadness and regret.

Some of the students related their personal experiences while in police custody, and implored the University to take up the responsibility of the search for truth and fairness, to see to it that justice is done.  Every student, regardless of his/her political stance, values or personal beliefs, and whether or not he/she might have done something wrong, is a family member of CUHK.  In teaching students to accept responsibility for their own action, the University shall also help them assert their rights.  Since the meeting last Thursday, I have received over 800 e-mails and written opinions from many different stakeholders.  I saw how the evening’s event had been interpreted, analyzed and evaluated by different media, and in various signed petitions from students, colleagues and alumni.  Out of this myriad of opinions one thing is clear: The University is expected to make best use of its status, standing, and influence to ensure a fair treatment of the related issues and the students affected.

Follow-up actions on the students arrested

Since last Friday, we have contacted each and everyone of the more than 30 students arrested to find out what they had gone through after their arrests and during detention.  Most of them said their requests for timely communicating with their lawyers or families were unsuccessful, and they could only make their first (and only) phone-call from a few hours to as long as 78 hours after their arrests.  In some cases the students were made to give police statement in the absence of a lawyer.  One of the students said that, even when his family had arrived at the police station where he was held, they could not see him.  He was not permitted a phone call or a meeting with his family in the same station during the 48 hours while he was detained.  Some students pointed out that they were not permitted to sleep or lie down to rest.  Some other students said they were not given the medication they needed, and a student with asthma had to wait for six hours to be treated.  According to another student who suffered a head injury, despite his request to go to the hospital, he was only sent to the accident and emergency ward after 18 hours in detention.  More seriously, more than one students said they were slapped in the face while giving a statement or during detention, and two students said they were forced to strip naked by a police officer of the same sex in the search room despite having been told of no such need for strip search.  The above are all serious allegations made by our students of CUHK. 

Among the cases that came to our attention, about 20 students said they had received one or more of the above unreasonable treatments in varying degrees of severity.  These are not isolated incidents but serious allegations from a human rights point of view.  They are all the more unacceptable if bodily harm was inflicted.  Upon hearing from the students themselves what physical and mental pains they had suffered, I felt sad and anguished.  I cannot over-emphasize that, irrespective of why our students were arrested, the police should ensure that the rights of the arrested must not be infringed upon during arrest and detention.  The public rightly expect from law enforcement agencies nothing less than the upholding of the highest standards and the practice of cautiousness and judiciousness by its personnel.  The police are also expected to ensure proper handling of the matter and keep the public informed after a thorough investigation.

To responsibly deal with the above cases, the University had promptly elicited help from volunteer alumni lawyers, especially those with experience in gender equality and human rights issues.  We hope that with such legal assistance and consent of the students concerned, each case can be properly documented and submitted to the relevant authorities as a formal complaint and representation so as to facilitate prompt, fair and open investigations.  In fact, the University has contacted the Independent Police Complaint Council (IPCC) directly, which was very receptive to our request and promised to send observers to all the meetings between the Complaints Against Police Office (CAPO) and the complainants and to conduct on-site evidence gathering in a fair and just manner.  I hereby call upon our students affected that you should exercise your rights.  My colleagues and I are willing to accompany you and your lawyers to file complaints at the relevant authorities so as to protect your legal rights and demand proper and judicious handling of your cases. 

I understand that many members of the University and the public share with us a deep concern for the case of one of our own students, Miss Ng.  We are in close contact with Miss Ng, offering our help.  We understand that she is under enormous pressure, and has disclosed at public appearances or interviews many facts and details of her experience.  I hereby urge the CAPO to take prompt action to investigate her case based on the publicly available evidence, preferably in conjunction with IPCC scrutiny.  Time is of the essence here.  I also strongly urge all to desist from doing any act of intimidation, harassment or obstructing any victim to seek help.

Regrettably, those students we have contacted so far are not yet willing to take the first step due to their anxiety towards the police or distrust of the CAPO and the IPCC.  While I feel frustrated by this state of affairs, I understand that the mistrust of existing mechanisms among students and the public does not begin today.  In view of the gravity of the matter, I will write to the Chief Executive to exhort her to initiate independent investigation of the 20 or so cases involving CUHK students outside existing mechanisms.  This will hopefully reaffirm the rule of law and restore public confidence.  As a matter of fact, demands for the government to establish an independent commission of inquiry to try to get to the root cause of police-civilian conflicts or related matters have grown louder and louder in the past few months.  The government must constructively address such demands, for only the truth can bring justice to all.

Protecting members of the University is a responsibility we cannot abdicate.  At the same time, when judiciousness is expected of us by members of the University as well as the general public, as Vice-Chancellor and President I must exercise prudence when the credibility of the University is capitalized, and must not jump to unsubstantiated conclusions. Otherwise, the campus is likely to be turned into a dispute-driven battlefield, and insult will be added to injury for those who have already been hurt by additional malicious attacks. Any proven case of improper use of force or violations of human rights by certain police officers must be condemned.

Safety measures on campus

At the meeting last week, concern over the unjustified presence of police discharging duties on campus was voiced time and again.  Within the property boundary of our University campus, we will do everything we can to safeguard the legal rights of all our members.  Upon the request of the police to enter our campus, the University Security Office will normally require them to give reasons for doing so, whether it is for executing court orders (such as a search or arrest warrant), conducting investigation with the consent of those involved in a crime, or if they are under reasonable suspicion that the perpetrator of a crime is present on the premises.  I hope the University community will appreciate that we are duty-bound to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in any criminal investigation.  But the University will first obtain from the police the relevant information such as the purpose and location of their investigation before granting them entry.  The University will also arrange our staff to accompany any concerned parties during the investigation or search by police on campus, and to notify the relevant units when it is lawful and reasonable to do so.  If needed, lawyers can be arranged to assist with the students and staff so as to safeguard their legal rights (24-hour legal assistance has been in place).

The University will strengthen the training and alertness of our frontline security personnel.  The University has also deployed more personnel to deal with the increased number of various types of incidents on campus.

Strengthening emergency responses

During my meeting with the students and alumni last week, I commented on the distress caused to members of the University due to the social unrest and its repercussions on campus life in the last few months.  In these difficult times, many members of the CUHK expect more support from the University.  I am grateful to students, colleagues and alumni for their dedicated efforts.  Our colleagues on the frontline have committed a great deal of their time and energy to engage the students, boost their morale, and prevent disputes and improper conduct. 

The crisis management group that I chair has been responsible for the formulation and implementation of policies and emergency measures.  In view of the rapidly changing circumstances and after hearing from the stakeholders, I have decided to take the work of the group one step further in order to ensure even more timely responses to emergencies with better coordination and decision-making.  The University will set up a cross-functional Rapid Response Task Force with subgroups in five areas of support.  These subgroups will have student and alumni representatives and report directly to me.  They are:

(1)   Cultural Inclusion Subgroup (culturalis@cuhk.edu.hk )

Convenor: Prof. Dennis Ng, Pro-Vice-Chancellor

(2)   Academic Support Subgroup (academicss@cuhk.edu.hk )

Convenor: Ms. Kitty Yu, Registrar

(3)   Campus Safety, Security and Legal Matters Subgroup (csslms@cuhk.edu.hk )

Convenor: Mr. Eric Ng, Vice-President (Administration)

(4)   Student Support and Well-being Subgroup (ssws@cuhk.edu.hk )

Convenor: Prof. Dennis Ng, Pro-Vice-Chancellor

(5)   Communications and Engagement Subgroup (caes@cuhk.edu.hk )

Convenor: Mr. Eric Ng, Vice-President (Administration)

Let trust, hope and compassion be our guide

The troubling events in society and on campus in the past few months have been a tough, learning process for us all.  It is my belief and deep conviction that sincere, direct and honest dialogue will lead us out of the present impasse, but strong polarization will never bring compromise.  Reconciliation of the schism can only be approached and reached with sincerity and honesty.  The success of Hong Kong depends on the rule of law and Hong Kong people being united behind it.  The negative sentiments in society have reached an alarmingly critical point.  The escalating violence and acts of destruction must stop.  The government must act fast to come up with feasible strategies to solve the problems in order to rekindle hope for the younger generations who are the future of Hong Kong.

The University fully recognizes that we face a bumpy road ahead. Nevertheless, we will faithfully abide by our mission: to disseminate knowledge, serve the society, and cultivate virtue.  We will maintain the campus as a place where the search for truth can be freely pursued and where students are nurtured in the spirit of “Through learning and temperance to virtue”, the motto of the University passed down by our Founding Fathers.  To remain a haven for all, we must not lose sight of unity, openness, inclusivity, reason, and mutual respect, and be continually inspired by the virtues of trust, hope, and compassion.

I am a native son, born and raised in Hong Kong, my beloved home.  I grew up in a loving, hard-working family that lived under the Lion Rock, like hundreds of thousands of families in Hong Kong: we sweated and toiled, we worked and played, we learned and adapted, we constantly reinvented ourselves, and always believing in a better tomorrow.  Regardless of political persuasions, all of us in Hong Kong are in the same boat and have a whole lot more in common than being different.  I sincerely hope that truth will bring reconciliation.  I very earnestly look forward to the moment when the precious and beautiful spiritual wealth of Hong Kong will be rekindled with brightness and vigour.

Rocky S. Tuan
Vice-Chancellor and President

The Chinese University of Hong Kong


TLDR : on 10 Oct 2019, Rocky Tuan had a 4-hr conversation with students and alumni on the issue of Hong Kong's protests and arrests of students, one female student openly criticized sexual assault by police. 

Tuan got in touch with the arrested students and highlighted the unreasonable mistreatments by the police. He saw the cases and felt sad and anguished, voluntary alumni lawyers are immediately contacted to help the students. 

He saw distrusts between students and police, but will urge the investigation from Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Any proven case of improper use of force or violations of human rights by certain police officers must be condemned.

Protecting the students is the University's responsibility, security in the campus will be improved.

There are people out in Hong Kong acting as small terrorist groups as in they: make Molotov type things using petrol, they put knifes at the end of their umbrellas, and they are trying to acquire explosives and other weapons to attack the police with. The police are getting provoked with these things that these “terrorists” (as some people may call it)/ rioters are doing. Yes, the police are still doing things that are way against human rights and they way those protesters are being treated is completely wrong, but the police are getting extremely provoked with the rioters. I do not think that these rioters should be doing what their doing at all and they are the ones that should be arrested more often. Otherwise the Hong Kong protesters should keep up what they’re doing and try to become their own type of government that doesn’t deal with all the crap that the Chinese throw at them. The police are also doing things that I’m pretty sure are illegal like hiding their ID and actually shooting protesters and we have to put a stop to it by gathering any support.

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)**

*Q1: I thought the bill was already passed ?*

The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019 has been passed in the US House of Representative on Oct 15th. We are now pushing for the bill to be passed in the US Senate.

&amp;#x200B;

*Q2:  How many Senators are co-sponsoring this bill?*

28 Senators [Co-Sponsoring this Bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1838/cosponsors) \+ 1 Sponsor (Last update: Oct 17).

&amp;#x200B;

*Q3: How many Yes Votes do we need in the US Senate?*

51+ Yes Votes is required to pass the bill in the Senate. But we are aiming for two thirds 67+ Yes Votes (enough to defeat any Presidential veto)

&amp;#x200B;

*Q4: And what kind of effect can an American bill have on China?*

As the name implies, if the Hong Kong government complies, the people of Hong Kong will be protected against human rights abuses, against tyranny and against erosion of freedoms (freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc...) However, if the Hong Kong government does not comply, it will put an end to the free trade between Hong Kong and US, sealing a loophole which China has been abusing to bypass US tariffs and US sanctions. It will also severely affect Hong Kong as an international free trading city, pushing the city into recession. As Hong Kong is the gateway in/out of China, 70% of all foreign direct investments into China comes from/through Hong Kong, Hong Kong going into recession will significantly hurt the Chinese economy.

In a high stakes game of chess, this is ""Check""

&amp;#x200B;

*Q5: Can you tell me more about the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act 2019?*

Rough translation, here goes:

Carrie Lam responds to the growing trend of doxxing prevalent in this anti-ELAB movement by considering modification of the Privacy Ordinance to deny the possibility of doxxing by looking up the various publicly-available datasheets.

The government has found about 100 different datasheets that is available to the public; such datasheets may be read by the public and  used to doxx individuals.

As of now, for election caldidate registrations, the field of ""address of residence"" will be replaced by simply ""address"".

Recent court cases also see the prosecution anonymizing the parties involved in the cases in the name of identity protection.

The government aims to complete the aforemetioned Privacy Ordinance modification in this government term.

There are concerns of ""Internet ban"" in response to the government's idea of banning access to disclosed doxxing information that is available in foreign domains. It is pointed out that the access bans will be ineffective with the use of VPN, which masks the true identity of Internet visitors.",hongkong,t3_djnr39

"Getting harder to stem the tide of wumao brigading our subAnyone notice the huge influx of wumao that came along with the Lebron and Blizzard controversies?

It’s getting harder to get any decent information in here when the wumao come in and spread disinformation..

"Should I get rid of my Huawei phone if I'm involved in the movement from abroad?I bought a Huawei phone a couple of months back, before I was really aware of the big spying thing. I am not well off so I had to save for it and I'm not keen to just lose that money. 

However I do have some major concerns now. 

Since a couple of weeks now I've been spreading the news about Hong Kong and the CCP wildly on Reddit and now fb, and writing to politicians, and so on. I'm hoping to join any street protests that spring up too.

I'm in New Zealand and I'm a fifth or sixth generation new Zealander. So presumably I am not being surveilled to the same degree as Chinese immigrants here.

But I still feel that I could be being watched given how vocal I've been.

How likely is it that I'm being surveilled through my Huawei phone, or will be in the near future?

"How do we Americans support Hong Kong?I go to a school with 30% Chinese boarding students, and most if not all have expressed their pro-Beijing beliefs. During class I showed a video of protesters singing the US anthem. In response to the video the Chinese students in my class said I was wrong, and claimed it's the protesters ignoring their consequences and trying to ruin China, blah blah. They complained about me and some girls were even crying to teachers about what I said. My teacher, sided with them, saying well we shouldn't immediately take that standpoint especially since American media is being biased due to Trump putting tariffs on Chinese goods. I believe an injustice anywhere in the world is a threat to worldwide freedom. I'm not sure what to do, it feels like I'm stuck here. What should I do? I want to support Hong Kong and spread awareness, but if I live in America and get attacked for simply exercising my freedom of speech. We have school announcements for anything, like donations, awareness, announcements, I was thinking about making one for Hong Kong. it seems a lot of people in my school don't know the real story, so I'm asking for tips or ways to help Hong Kong and ideas to put in the announcement. Thanks!

EDIT: A Chinese classmate got upset and cried to the teachers. She then told all her friends and spread rumors about me, which led to them confronting me and saying I'm dumb and stupid. I explained that the HK protesters are just trying to get basic human rights, its the HKPD abusing them, which is a violation of universal human rights. In response to that, the kid who confronted me said ""they want freedom and don't expect consequence. those type of idiots deserve to die"". What he told me got me so fucking upset, it's America's duty to support hong kong. we were built on the foundation of liberty to all. What happened now? Liberty to just the wealthy and the fortunate?

"[Discussion] Do you think this unrest has helped or hurt Hong Kong's chances at some form of genuine universal suffrage?Suppose the unrest stops today and society returns to normal.

Do you think Beijing will be more or less willing to offer concessions to give Hong Kong universal suffrage? As opposed to the restrictive nomination criterion.

I have seen two forms of reasoning:

1. More likely, as Beijing needs a stable Hong Kong, and they realise the importance placed on democracy by HK

2. Less likely, as it will hinder their ability to contain future unrest.

"Chief secretary says police doing an excellent job. (Sourcr:RTHK)Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung says the Hong Kong police are doing an excellent job after four months of protests triggered by a now-scrapped extradition bill.

But Cheung, who made the comments on a special edition of RTHK's Backchat programme, was challenged by listeners, one of whom said public opinion surveys showed that more than half of Hong Kong's residents distrust the force and blamed the administration for the fall in support.

Asked whether the government would restructure the police force, as many people have suggested, Cheung said: ""Let's not debate on something theoretical and academic at the moment.

""Rather, our job is to face the present crisis, tackle the present situation, bring order back to the community so that we can have calm and peace in the whole community.""

Protesters and pro-democracy leaders have heavily criticised the police for their handling of the four months of protests, including their use of force.

They are everywhere and they all use the exact same language. I don't know if they are brainwashed mainlanders or genuine CCP paid trolls? 

Even for newspapers behind an expensive paywall (e.g. Financial Times) you will still find these people. Typical behaviour: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. The same usernames always comment on China/ Hong Kong articles only. Nowhere else, ever. 
2. They all use the same highly inflamed language of hurt feelings, saying that western media is propaganda, they threaten to cancel their subscription. 
3. They comment around the clock as if they have no jobs or nothing else to do. 
4. They get instant recommendations - very unusual behaviour if you notice how these recommendations should develop gradually over time. 

Lately, I have seen some of them they even try to use other tactics like say something positive first and then all of a sudden switch the language. Or use some funny user names with English names or something like LGBT supporter etc while supporting concentration camps and authoritarianism.

Most of us don't even know what's going on on the other side of the border.

For instance:

* a network router: in 3 stores, only one was not made in china
* a TV sound bar: zero in local stores, found ONE on amazon not from china
* shower curtains: broke down and bought one because 100% seem to be from china.  might make my own for the next one
* pizza cutter: currently don't own one since my last one broke, and I can't find one not made in china
* kitchen knives: very challenging, but possible to find
* scissors: only brand I could find that didn't make in china was Wiss.

what products have you guys struggled to find?

Do you have any tips for buying local?

Shouldn't online retailers make it easier to discover country of origin?  Amazon, you've made it almost impossible.

"Words from a criminal barrister: Condemning protest violence in Hong Kong won’t solve the problem – not when police are part of the problemHaving practised criminal law in Hong Kong for 40 years and defended individuals accused of a catalogue of crimes, ranging from massive fraud to the most heinous crimes of violence, I could lavishly chronicle the trials and tribulations of being a criminal barrister.

I can say that the challenges at the criminal Bar are often rewarded with the sense of triumph in seeing justice achieved when, more often than not, a conviction is returned on good evidence or the liberty of an accused is secured because the evidence is not up to the mark. In either event, there is adherence to a standard, a procedure, which people can trust and do trust. This is an important facet of our treasured rule of law. 

Experience at the criminal Bar carries with it the burden of a delicate sensitivity to any ruffling of law and order. The current conflicts in our society are therefore a particular cause of pain, conflicts in which many young people, including juveniles still in secondary school, find themselves on the wrong side of the law, having committed acts of road obstruction, serious vandalism, and sometimes even physical assault.

Very often, these young people are inflicted with serious injuries in the process of arrest and thereafter. It would be hard to find any decent, sensible and law-abiding individual who champions these young people simply because he or she supports criminal acts and the flouting of the law.

But many, including large sections of the local public and numerous members of the international community, do sympathise with these young people who are prepared to forgo their own liberty, safety and even their lives to give voice to a cause supported by many to change the injustices of the current establishment, which refuses point-blank to listen and to give way.

It is worth remembering the government’s ill-advised attempts to pass the much deplored extradition bill were halted only, and perversely, after many young people forcibly blocked entry into the Legislative Council due to pass the bill and engaged in violent clashes with the police. The recalcitrant stance of those who govern plays a large part in sowing the seeds of violence.

Violence cannot and must not be condoned, and no decent and sensible person I know condones the vandalism and violence perpetrated by those involved in the protests. Mere condemnation, however, does not help. It does not deal with the root of the problem, which lies in large part with those in government.

The problem, unfortunately, includes the police force, which executes the increasingly repressive policy of the government, and more. Since June, the release of tear gas by police has become the order of the day; it is not difficult to find footage of police beating up a protester who has been hunted down, or freely dispensing pepper spray at close range at protesters, journalists and even a legislator.

Complaints about beatings inside police stations after arrests are commonplace and have been reported by barristers who made legal visits. Yet, day in day out, one hears only official denials of abuse and wrongdoing (or excuses for inaction, as in the case of the July 21 incident in Yuen Long MTR station). The shooting of an 18-year-old on October 1 was justified by the commissioner of police as “lawful” and “reasonable” just hours after the incident, even though basic international principles demand a full inquiry and report.
None of the lawbreakers in uniform are being brought to account. Indeed, they cannot even be identified because they eschew any identification, as required by the police’s own rules and guidelines. Arbitrary arrests abound. Ordinary citizens have been arrested for shouting abuse at police.

No one underestimates the difficulty of the police’s job in these circumstances, but neither reason nor restraint is being shown. The standards and procedures we have taken pride in and taken for granted for so long seem to have vanished. The professionalism of the police force is also being questioned.
In such a climate, the Bar Association, of which I am a council member, has in my view rightly identified the relevant legal issues and spoken out about them.

It is not shameful to hold those armed with power, public authority and weaponry to account. Nor is pointing out that the problem is an intractable executive. This is what the Bar Association should do in defending the rule of law.

Author’s bio:
Lawrence Lok is a criminal barrister called to the Bar of England and Wales in 1978, and called to the Hong Kong Bar in 1979. He has been practising criminal law at all levels of court ever since. He has also served as a recorder of High Court, and currently serves as a member of the Bar Council.

"IDEA: Expand the remit of the ICAC to investigate abuse of police powersThe ICAC was established in 1974 and is a truly independent law enforcement division in HK.  It is vested with law enforcement powers such as investigation, arrest, detention and granting of bail.  It was established to combat the rampant corruption within government organisations and the police.

In general, corruption is a form of dishonesty or criminal activity undertaken by a person or organization entrusted with a position of authority, often to acquire illicit benefit, or, abuse of entrusted power for one's private gain.  Therefore, an argument could be made that the abuse of power by the HKPF should fall under ICAC’s remit.

Let’s face it, the HK Independent Police Complaints Council is ran by the police and thus is not truly independent.  HKPF does not have the trust of the people and is simply not equipped the investigate itself.

The ICAC already has the skill set and powers to conduct investigations and it would be easier to extend its remit than to estabish another independent organisation.  The ICAC cleaned up the HKPF once already in 1974, it can do it again!",hongkong,t3_djd1ao

"Anyone else feeling frustrated by all the petty moves/responses from the government?I understand that at this point it’s hopeless to expect the government would do anything sensible, but noticing these petty moves still make my blood boil. 

1. Matthew Cheung literally said we should [move forward and get over with 721 Yuen Long attack](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1486693-20191017.htm?spTabChangeable=0)
- Huh? Wtf? Let’s just drop all investigation at all?

2. When being asked if the government is causing the social unrest, Carrie Lam downright reject the claim and said the “rioters” are responsible for that. 
- Why in the first place people are protesting then? Again the excuses of “only a small group of people”? Still refusing to acknowledge the problems. That means she still doesn’t think the government should have to do anything to calm down the public anger. 

3. When the police / someone pro-China being attacked, the government or Carrie Lam herself are quick to issue statement to condemn the protestors, even in the middle of the night. Now, where are yours statements then, concerning the blatant attacks on Jimmy Sham? [Only a reluctant condemn from Matthew Cheung on a radio programme](https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/en/component/k2/1486689-20191017.htm) Or even, where are your statements when the citizens are injured?

"I made this, on the spur of the moment, and decided to share it with you**Please note:** I know that this might not be relevant to any of you. I debated whether to post it or not, and decided that I would do it, in the hopes that maybe one person would enjoy it or at least appreciate the effort that was put into it. I've been following the situation closely and I'm doing my best to spread awareness. It's surprising how little people actually know about what's happening and I'm trying to change that; at least locally. Even if I can't make much of a difference, Hong Kong has my support. Oh, and I don't think I've ever written a poem (or whatever the hell you'd call this) outside of school, so don't be too hard on me. I'm only posting to show that I care.

Want to know about Hong Kong?

An American living in HK submitted the below email to websites of US Senator Hawley, Senator Cruz and 60 minutes (for their biased piece
on the HK protest movement) 

So well written. Must Read. 

————————-
Senator Hawley
Your willingness to sacrifice an entire city,  it’s way of life,  it’s civility,  the future of its youth,  it’s freedoms unmatched anywhere else in the world, and it’s high degree of autonomy in a historically unique circumstance,  is in my opinion a crime against humanity.  

Your sole punitive objective of giving China a black eye,  demonstrates not only a childish approach to the needs of the world, but also demonstrates a depravity of moral value, unbecoming  of any religious institution whether Christian, Muslim, Judaism or Buddhism. 

And you call yourself a Christian.  Should I not be surprised that the most brutal inhuman treatment of other humans beings i have ever witnessed is being committed  by your Christian led organisation? 

The world is NOT seeing the truth of HONG Kong.   And your only perpetuating that lie. It is seeing a facade of half truths created by one nation with the sole intent of undermining another nation hoping to curtail the continued emergence of that  nation on the world stage.  The world is seeing a singular view of HONG Kong events from the lense of those who wish to destroy its parent,  where the only possible outcome is to completely sacrifice the child.   

I’m not going to excuse China’s  past behaviour.  But to choose HONG Kong as the sacrificial lamb  for that reckoning is not only morally wrong, it’s is tactically and strategically wrong - if your objective is to bring China to its knees.   You will not achieve your objective by bringing anarchy to HONG Kong. 

You are choosing the ways of the past to solve problems of the future.   HONG Kong May need change but don’t revert to a page In the history of china (cultural revolution) to destroy a society and attempt to build a new one  on its ashes when no one in the protest movement,  nor their American benefactors, are presenting a better option to what was one of the freest societies on earth protected by One of of the best, most restrained and least corrupt police forces on the planet. 

———————

Senator Cruz
If you don’t understand something don’t weigh in.  Your incomplete view can destroy lives.  Your being a sideline US enabler  of violent protesters will have no positive outcome for the protesters your supporting...or the city stuck in between your real target (China) and your country.  So quit using Hong Kong and it’s students as a pawn  in your clear objective to curtail what you fear -   Chinese hegemony in the region.   Your unknowingly only perpetuating that outcome.

I am an American living in  HONG Kong and  for you to come to this city,  claim you see no violence in your short limited time here, and give unquestioned support to those who are destroying this city is an affront to all intelligent law abiding peaceful people who live here. 

These protesters you are supporting are violating and undermining all  rules of law of this great city.   They are clearing a path to anarchy.  They are  lynching innocent bystanders (who are in fact voicing their freedom of speech in the most basic ways),  they are destroying anything and everything of a contrary view (and in the most violent way).  They are destroying public property everyone in this city depends on.  They are committing the most horrendous acts of violence against fellow human beings - Yet you support them. 

You are an evangelical Christian but there is nothing Christian like in the protesters behavior.  It’s Ironic isn’t it -  that the most inhuman and brutal  treatment of fellow human beings I have ever witnessed in my life comes at the hands of your Christian  lead movement.  Shame on you Mr Cruz for perpetuating a lie - you see no violence!

There is nothing peaceful about these protests. There is nothing Christian about their murderous and destructive ways.  There is nothing  Democratic about their wholesale rejection of anyone who speaks a contrary opinion or offers any solution different from theirs (and they don’t offer any solutions) 

For you to claim you see no evidence of violence by the protesters you are supporting shows you are nothing  but  an  unmitigated  liar or a complete idiot.   Such a statement from a foreign government official unmasks your true intentions. 

I have seen a lot in my worldy travels but I have never seen a peaceful, law abiding free and open society descend into such  chaos, over such a short period of time. Where mob justice underpinned by mob violence is the new law in the streets, where those you are supporting are demonstrating a complete lack of humanity to fellow human beings - and propagandising everything in their wake.  

Perhaps you would like the same violence inflicted on your city?  your transport system destroyed,  the business in your neighbourhoods set to fire, your friends beaten to an inch of their lives,  your young children brainwashed and becoming modern day red guards, only to loose their futures consumed by their hatred and violence which has no possible positive outcome them.  Then have representatives of foreign governments come to your city vocally supporting those who are destroying the city. 

Your misguided sense of righteousness is going to lead to ruination for those you are  supporting.   And you will shoulder that blame,  and those in this society will never forget that.  Accountability will fall on your shoulders. 

You can take your false Christian values and take them straight to hell with you Mr. Cruz.

I love your show.  Always have for the last 30+ years.   But I am incredibly dismayed by your single sided view of the HONG Kong  protest movement.  A completely unbalanced view of a Christian lead movement that is committing unspeakable acts of violence and showing a lack of humanity I never thought possible. All  against the citizens in Hong Kong who,  if you had done your research, might find them to be a majority.  

You made no attempt to seek a view of the other side.  And by the other side I do not mean China.  I mean the majority of people living in this city,  now living under a cloud of fear - fearful of speaking any contrary opinion to those who are ironically seeking a democratic platform - those very people you are supporting who  have not shown an iota of tolerance for other opinion, but rather have shown an incredible lack of humanity in the violent mob justice they are committing against so many in this city - including a very large number of single elderly individuals who happen to be unlucky enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  

Not Jimmy Lai,  nor Joshua Wong, nor their violent protesters running amuck   destroying the fabric of life in what once was the most open,  free,  law abiding place on Earth, are appropriate  representatives of HONG Kong.  But they  are in fact the only reason the people of this city are loosing their freedoms and their gold standard legal system.  Not China. 

Next time do your research before becoming an unwitting (or perhaps witting) enabler of the violence being inflicted on a city,  and the majority of people living here - living now in fear - not because of Anything China has done,  but what the protesters,  and those of you who are enabling them -are doing.",hongkong,t3_dj9zmm
"Safe for Mainlander-looking exchange student?I'm a foreigner who looks Mainland-ish and who is going to study at Hong Kong as an exchange student.

Should I be worried about my safety?

Also, how political can it get in a university?

"What have you NOT purchased from China lately?""I'm not located in Hong Kong, what can I do to help?""

Not giving money to China is arguably one of the easier things to do to show support, wherever you are located. Your money *is* your vote.

Just want to make a thread to encourage those who feel like they can't escape from buying *made in China* whenever I mention it as a personal economic protest. You don't have to give up trying just cause you can't do it for everything. Every purchase matters.

Here are my examples, from the US:

- A teflon pan, made in Portugal, from Marshall's.

- Clover brand seam rippers, made in Japan, from Amazon / eBay.

- Clothes, used, from various local thrift stores and eBay.

- Mugs, used, from local thrift stores.

- Asics sneakers, Made in Vietnam, from local shoe store at the mall.

- Small trash can, Made in Thailand, from Daiso.

- Rubber cleaning gloves, Made in Taiwan, from Daiso.

- Laptop, used, from eBay.

- Tacco shoe sole inserts, Made in Germany, from eBay / Amazon.

- T-shirts, Made in Vietnam, from Uniqlo.

- Bike, Made in Taiwan, VeloOrange.

- None of my unprocessed foods are from China. It gets harder to rule out China when food is processed and packaged, even when they are made in wherever else. In the US food companies aren't required to disclose where they source their ingredients to the consumers.

"More than one investor of Blizzard assists the Chinese Government!!! While looking through the history of Blizzard to determine how they lost their soul I stumbled upon an investor that is not as obviously Chinese as Tencent. **The company is Davis Advisors** and they were part of the 3 companies (ASAC Ii LP) that helped invest into Blizzard to make it ""independent."" In many interviews Davis Advisors state that they own Alibaba (and other Chinese companies) which are in charge of the vast majority of transactions between governmental entities within China. *This is something I have yet to see reported!!!!* Why is nobody talking about this? 2 out of the 3 big investors (Tencent and Davis Advisors) are directly involved in Chinese governmental operations and put up the bulk of the money invested in the company to ""free"" itself.

If people are wondering why Blizzard bends the knee to China it is because they are using some really comfy wallets from Tencent and Davis Advisors to pad their knees...

We break down this and all the other news surrounding the Blizzard controversy on our latest episode of the Lamer Gamers Podcast in a Sidequest episode called ""The Chinese Blizzard"" out now!

"so there is a filter that prevents certain information from being distributed - would you like to know what you are not allowed to know? [ mod: usernames removed - post is compliant ]so this can be defeated by turning it into a picture ( for now - facebook for example is developing technology to read the text even of pictures ).  j

Here is the image of the text that if you enter it into a comments field in reddit, it is automatically removed:  https://i.imgur.com/hbcwAm1.png

Here are resources of images of that historical event that a certain country has tried to erase from the record:  https://i.imgur.com/EIpNy7n.png

So reddit is banned from China, but at the same time reddit has China-friendly censorship filters ... to what end?  Trying to get into the Chinese market, for monetary gain?  It's certainly not the morally correct thing to do.

Yes, money is *a* goal for any business, but also a goal for a business can be to facilitate free information, and as a result there will be money to be made, because that is what people desire.

The saying ""knowledge is power"" is true, and so therefore to withhold knowledge is to steal power, and to give knowledge is to distribute power equitably.  

Long live freedom, long live truthful information - beautiful and free like a bird in the sky.  

Wish you all the best of luck.  The ""Overton Window"" can be moved:  https://i.imgur.com/ELtfB5z.png  ( serious thoughts here, but there are serious times ).  

Wishing you all the best.  Never surrender.

"I have an idea : How to dispel the myth of CCP Propaganda that ALL Hong Kongers hate ALL Mainland Chinese.... we just need one brave person for this videoInspired by these youtube videos :

[South Korea : I am a North Korean Defector, Would You Hug me?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba98eOZTze8)

[Los Angeles : Blind Muslim Trust Experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3UvgaxDoig)

[China : I‘m gay, would you hug me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UISZz_nFTNQ) (I saw a longer video and there were some bruises on the volunteers)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Find a place far far far away from any Hong Kong Police Force and far away from any Pro-Beijing hot spots
2. Have one very brave Mainland Chinese who is in Hong Kong willing to do this, I am sorry to say I cannot predict 100% what will happen... it is possible the volunteer could get hurt (maybe some people hiding nearby... just incase to prevent any serious hurt and life threatening situations)
3. The person editing the video might need to work OT to blur out some faces
4. The message is Hong Kongers do not hate ordinary Mainland Chinese people, they just do not like those CCP, Triads, Corrupt Hong Kong Police, puppet Hong Kong government leaders, who are oppressing and terrorizing the Hong Kong people.
5. The placard probably needs to be in English, Traditional Chinese (Cantonese) and Simplified Chinese (Mandarin)
6. I am not exactly sure what to say, maybe: I am a Mainland Chinese and I do not support the Chinese Communist regime. I support Democracy and Freedom.  I trust you, do you trust me ? Give me a hug.

Well the placard cannot say I am a Mainland Chinese and I support Hong Kong (I think)... because of course Hong

Kong people are going to hug him/her. (so... this part here might need a bit of work, sorry brainfreeze) ...maybe it

could say I support ""One Country, Two Systems"". I support Universal Suffrage for Hong Kong. idk...

7. This video can also be used to heal the rift between ordinary people from Hong Kong and China. There is currently too much mistrust, suspicion, anger (which is all understandable, Hong Kong people are under immense pressure by their government and Chinese agents and all the Chinese communist propaganda is not helping, it only further divides people)

8.   Examples of Mainland Chinese supporting Hong Kong: [You are not alone!](https://twitter.com/hecha042772579/status/1182155608142708737) l [ChenSiuQi 陈秋实](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1YJYzNFhOM) l [Passport](https://twitter.com/jeffielam/status/1156794437445361664) l [HK Stay strong Be vigilant](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cq5ool/a_few_words_from_a_mainlander_who_stands_with_the) l [I support HK from Mainland](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/cxufq3/why_i_support_hk_from_the_mainland) l [I will pray for HK](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dda73c/support_from_a_mainlander) l [The reality is Hong Kongers are also fighting for Mainland Chinese](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dh6oee/mainlander_hong_kongers_arent_fighting_only_for) l [Beijing supports HK](https://twitter.com/Lionmountains1/status/1181996818105683968)

1. What do you think of this social experiment?
2. What message should the placard says?

p/s: I think it can be a really powerful video. The Pro-CCP will say all kind of things... she/he is not really Mainland Chinese.... so you need a real Mainland Chinese, with Mainland Chinese accent, and maybe a Passport around his/her neck or something...",hongkong,t3_dj3zcl
"The 5th of NovemberI'm nobody. Just another expat. I wasn't born here, but after a few years in this city, Hong Kong feels more like home than anywhere else. I've watched the protests from my window in Wan Chai since day one, from the first marches of millions that went unseen and unheard by the government to the more frenetic clashes between police and protesters that spring up every weekend. I've listened to the chants calling for a free Hong Kong as I sat down for dinner. At times, I have been terrified of the violence on the streets, and though I have not always agreed with the more extreme methods, I have always believed that the fight the protesters were waging was a necessary one. Free speech cannot exist anywhere if it does not exist everywhere. On Monday, as I walked home past the stream of people marching to Chater park, I felt ashamed. My wife an I each said, ""I wish there was more that we could do."" I was afraid that white faces would co-opt the message of these protests, or seem disingenuous, or just be further used by state media to portray them as a foreign led uprising.

November is almost here, and with it, the fifth. The Guy Fawkes mask has been in circulation as part of the protests for months now, so it's hardly a new association, but it's one that I believe needs constant reinforcing. The government has, at every step of this process, misjudged the will of the people and their dedication to preserving their own way of life. They have responded with force, believing that dissent would vanish as those dissatisfied shrank back in fear. They have attempted to spin a climate of terror to keep people in line. But each escalation has only been met in kind. They want the people to be afraid, ""but people should not be a afraid of their governments . . . Governments should be afraid of their people.""

I'm not advocating for violence. I don't agree with the use of petrol bombs or the destruction of civilian property, but I know why protesters have been pushed there. The original 5 November incident was an attempted coup of the government by explosives in parliament. I hope nobody is planning anything like that, but I think the day needs to be marked, all the same. The government needs to be reminded how many of their people are dissatisfied with this regime. They need to see it unmistakably, not marching down a street, but everywhere they turn. I think that, on the fifth, every person who wants to show Carrie Lam that she does not speak for or represent the people of this city should wear a mask. All day. No violence. No aggression or fires or attacks. Just a sea of masked faces across Hong Kong.",hongkong,t3_dixmxz

"Don’t lose patience and stay vigilantI am worried for all of you in Hong Kong. Just with my understanding of the mindset of Chinese government, they can have a lot of patience and can bide their time. 

Especially since this incident is viewed as an “isolated” incident, unlike Tiananmen Square, where multiple cities China were in upheaval and not just limited to Beijing. The government thinks they can outlast you, and when HK starts becoming impatient and commits some sort of “grave” mistake (ie. attacking a high level Chinese) will they be able to justify a crackdown.

Right now, the quality of life of Chinese citizens is too high compared to the past, so instead of sympathizers you get haters instead.

Stay strong, stay patient, and remain vigilant. Don’t be rash. Know that the whole world is watching and many supporting.",hongkong,t3_dizcxz
