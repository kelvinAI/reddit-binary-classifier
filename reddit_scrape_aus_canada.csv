"A lot of Australian TV has been making it to US Netflix. Y'all make great movies and television, and I've been enjoying the hell out of it.I first discovered Australian TV/Movies (other than Mad Max, the original film being one of the greatest movies of all time IMAO) with ""Tomorrow when the war began"" because it reminded me of Red Dawn. The original one.

TWTWB was an order of magnitude better than the remake of Red Dawn, which was just... bad. 

Since then I've discovered shows like Glitch and Pine Gap.

After watching a few of these shows, I feel like ABC has production values that match or exceed US/UK/Canadian television.

Glitch is some great brain popcorn, and is much better written and acted than US shows with similar production costs. You've also got some pretty cerebral stuff, too. 

Secret City and The Code both look really good.

2.    The Song **Ancient Mountains**  \-  The lyrics ""White man finds his progress prime...black man feels no urge to climb""     I interpreted those lyrics as the aboriginals are content being one with nature and whites have that constant desire to change and move into something new....? Is that about right? Be interested to hear thoughts on that...

&amp;#x200B;

3. The song **Thats Why They Call Him Sundown**  \-   Is this about a bush pilot? 

&amp;#x200B;

4. The Song **40 years Ago** \- Is this about World War I or II?       The part about the digger standing with a rifle upside down? Am I missing something other than a soldier just taking a break somewhere?   The part about he died when a woman could walk anywhere in town. If she's not safe in years of peace why did he go to war?       I can understand this...but I was just curious if there was some specific context you all might be aware of about these lines or not. This song in particular touched me.

"r/Australia, help me find a TV show and song I've been looking for since 2012!Looking for a song, actually. I remember a program/show that played music, kinda like Rage, not sure if it WAS Rage. Specifically, it played k-pop at some point. I watched it once between 2008-2012 and a song that played on there got stuck in my head and hasn't left that whole time. I'm assuming it's k-pop, because a friend (who's into that kind of stuff) sent me a song that I swear I remember from the show ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofwFr8o8p0Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofwFr8o8p0Y)). So, was there a music program that played on Australian TV (I live in QLD, if that matters) that played k-pop at some point? Or was it not even k-pop? Is there an English song that sounds like the one I linked? I know this post is all over the place but I must determine where I remember this song from, I've been looking for it for the past 7 years now.",australia,t3_dkzoqe

My mum is very gullible and falls for a lot of MMS schemes so I was pretty skeptical when she showed me the letter and then their quote. They're quoting us around $8,000 on a HIVE 2.9kWh battery and installation. They would also have access to some information on energy use and yadiyada for 12 months.

"Question about dating in Australia from an American...Quick question, delete if not rule-abiding or whatnot. Living in NYC, recently went on 3 dates with an Aussie girl that I met on Tinder. The dates went well where we had a lot in common, got along, mutual attraction, etc etc. She asked to hang out this weekend but I was booked for a wedding with a platonic friend. She got a bit standoffish that I was a plus one for a friend and explained it as a culutural difference. She said that in Australia, when you first start to date someone, you only go out with that person exclusively. And then that continues until you make things official or you go your separate ways. She also said that having sex makes you an automatic couple and anyone ""playing the field"" is kinda slut-shamed. We haven't had sex yet but the whole thing kinda threw me for a loop. 

She said she doesn't understand this part of American culture of dating different people till you find the right fit. I appreciate her honesty but I had never heard this before. Is there any validity to it?",australia,t3_dkp94q

"(University Student) Advice Requested Moving From TAS to QLD?Hi, just wondering what my options are towards student accommodation on the Petrie, 4502, QLD. I'll be moving there for my engineering degree. Here's my question about the Petrie area in general?

I'm currently living on $445 fortnightly from Centrelink due to being on DSP. Additionally, once, I move out and attend college at the USC campus at Petrie. I'll be earning close to $645 fortnightly.

Is living on $645 even realistic? I'm pretty much a minimalist by nature, and can live on the very basics. However, I hear student accommodation around the area is expensive, or am I wrong?

I've been chatting with some people about my move towards the area and many have suggested moving into a cheap caravan park for short term stay. This will be my first time moving to a new city.

Overall, once, I leave home, I'll be getting $645 fortnightly from Centrelink. Later on, I'll be 21 in march and will be getting close to $900 fortnightly.

Would like to find a busy city where I can work, commute easily, and have some outdoor activities (love the water especially but have also always been interested in the backpacking / hiking of aus)

My current haphazard plans would be booking a ticket anytime I find a flight low (ready to leave those months) and potentially from California as I have friends there.

Go with 1k pocket money, air bnb or hostel for a week/two while finding more permanent residency and work. I have not looked at specific restaurants/resorts to look at because I'm not sure where I'll be wanting to stay.

I'm from Richmond, Virginia which is middle of the East coast and while an old City with ""southern"" vibes, it's grown to be a very progressive art hub, ""foodie"" city, and most of all has an amazing river running through it that has been my saving grace / escape during the warm months.

Ive heard ads during the news stories for example. Theres been a crash on the M1 then breaks to an ad  "" get your tyres checked at bob jane to avoid an accident"" then back to news.

Ive also heard them during songs when the song goes silent then u hear ""goto national tiles"" then song continues.

My question is with such shit existing why doesnt someone release their own radio station with proper DJs and great music? Surely the radio stations we currently have wouldnt be hard to beat and it wouldnt be difficult to raise the bar.

If you ask them whether you are paying for them, and they reply “there’s no additional cost” or “it comes part of your plan... this is code for “it comes included in the PRICE that they have given you... not the set plan cost . 2.... The additional SIM card that comes as ‘part of your plan... paying for that too. It’s included in the cost they have offered you too. For example, you’ve agreed to pay $99/month for your plan... probably $20 of that is an additional ‘sim card’, which is essentially a new number, they have total price pointed. 3... “If you are willing to change your number it will be cheaper”.  No lmao. This is because it is a sales target to get new numbers. It is the same price, they just won’t include an additional SIM card or accessories included. 4.

Always check a price online beforehand. These will be prices with none of the extras we sell included. Quote that, we have to match it. If you are unaware of a price, we will pitch you a price that has extras included such as accessories, an additional sim, or a data sim; always. Bottom line... if it seems too good to be true, 99% chance it is and you can get cheaper if you question everything on the contract. Stay safe. Save money. We will rip you off.",australia,t3_dk3lsl

"Salespeople in shopping centres/supermarkets are going too far to get your attention.I seriously, SERIOUSLY have had enough of these cunts. Every single time I go to a shopping centre or a supermarket I get asked and followed to the point of harassment by these annoying wont take no for an answer pricks. 

Just the other day I had to go out and do some stuff at my local shopping centre. First time I walked past “Hi what’s your name?” My name is not interested love. 
Walked back past to go to another shop. The 2nd girl at the little stall said “oh my god you have a jumper on, I have one on too would you like to hear what we’re selling?” No, I would fucking not, a jumper doesn’t give us some sort of secret code and bond which is gonna make me say yeah sure I’m really interested now unlike I was 3 minutes ago. 
I had to walk past a 3rd time to go back and pick up some scripts, this time the guy that was at the stall tried his luck “hey bro how’s it goin ya wouldn’t be interested in hearing about blah blah blah”. Fuck sake, NO, once again in the 5 minutes since I passed earlier my interest has not changed. 
So I pick up my scripts and I’m heading for the exit, knowing I have to walk past again, this time all 3 of them, the two girl and the guy physically walk across to block my path and like something from a horror movie all went “Are you suuuuree we can’t interest you buddy” simultaneously. I held my tongue, i understand they have a job to do but for Fuck sake, trying to entice me 4 times in about 15 minutes is just too much. You would think whoever their boss is would say, if you don’t get any interest from someone the first time, fucking leave them alone it’s not that hard. I’m not a mean person, if the cause was good and worthwhile I would’ve probably stopped and had a chat. But continuously harassing and badgering me while I’m just trying to go about my business then get the Fuck out of there is not ok. It’s also getting way to out of hand, I live in a town of around 37,000 people and they’re bad enough here. I can’t imagine how bad it’s getting in places like Melbourne, Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo and other major cities. Is anyone else getting fed up with this? Because I’m sure I’m not the only person who’s sick and tired of it. 

TL;DR CHUGGERS in my local shopping centre are getting way too pushy and harassing and I’m sick of it




Edit: So i DEFINITELY mean Chuggers. I didn’t know they were called that, they’re the ones I’m talking about. The actual people working in stores I have no issue with because they don’t generally approach you unless it’s to offer their help. Chuggers are the ones I can’t fucking stand.",australia,t3_djzjxr

"Struggles of getting internet (NBN, ADSL anything!). Living with no internet for a year!Hi guys, i am looking for some help/solutions that worked for people while getting internet. I moved in a new development about a year ago. We were told that we could not get ADSL, NBN or anything else. The only thing available was mobile broadband (OH MY GOD IS IT EXPENSIVE $80 for 200GB at Optus on a lucky deal). So i have been paying $160 for 400gb of unstable internet for a year now. I was told that my conduit pipe isn't connected to the pit. I paid a third party telecom company (Telstra licensed) over $3000 to fix it up. Then i was told that they don't have enough ports at the internet exchange so i should wait for NBN. A couple of months ago NBN was rolled out in my suburb and my neighbouring suburbs. My neighbours in all directions have NBN available. Telstra initially talked to NBN for me and confirmed that i should have NBN available because all my neighbours have it even though it didn't say so online. Then, they processed the order at the wrong address. I talked to them multiple times confirming the correct address, yet the technician came to my neighbour's house. However, he also confirmed that my house is NBN ready and he would be able to fix it up if he had the correct address. Then after talking to Telstra again, they reordered it but i was never sent any confirmation for it. After 8+ chats that were all over an hour, they are now saying that i will only get it in June 2020. I don't understand why i can't get it if the technician confirmed it is good to go and all my neighbours in all directions can get it and my entire suburb has access to it too. Please let me know if anyone has a solution or steps that should take.  


TLDR: Haven't had internet in my house for a year even though NBN has been rolled out in my area. 

edit: Suburb - Ringwood, 3134

Update: Aussie broadband said that they can't do anything until NBN changes the service class. NBN refused to look into it and didn't allow me to file dispute or a complaint.",australia,t3_djyn26

"People who got their Citizenship; Is there any possibility to move Citizenship ceremony to other Council to get an earlier date?Hi guys,

I have recently been approved for Australian Citizenship, and its a privilege to become one. Honestly, it was the happiest moment in my life.

However, my local council in Victoria has no more citizenship ceremonies this year at all. The earliest one would  probably be on 26th January 2020 (not confirmed yet), and there is a massive wait-list for that too (council's words)

due to some personal circumstances (i am sorry i cannot disclose here), I want to get my citizenship ceremony done before the end of the year (I know it may be selfish on my part)

Do people who have been through the process knows if there is any possibility  to move ceremony to an earlier date to any other council than my local one, or even fast track it?

Here is what i have tried so far,

* Multiple calls and emails to local councils with no luck. Basically they told me to contact Home Affairs.
* Multiple Calls and emails to Home Affairs. Never got a single response for an email, and every-time I got a response from a call, they always said **they don't allow fast-tracking ceremonies in Victoria** (I still don't understand why just Victoria?)

Is there a slightest possibility to reschedule ceremony somehow?

I was the impression they're not supposed to fob me off the the manufacturer for something they sold to me. However I'm not 100% sure on this any insight would be appreciated.

"Private Health is a ScamI’ve had my private health since I left home at 23. I’ve gritted my teeth through the insane price increases year on year. I always use up what I can. (General dental/optical/Physio) and generally break even. 

I’ve had my top two wisdom teeth taken out in the chair before. With my x rays my normal dentist tells me I have to get surgery. Annoying but whatever. 

Yesterday one of my bottom ones comes through. I’m in pain, and even swallowing is agonising. My normal dentist can’t get me in. So I call one close to work. Get new x rays and he tells me he can do the one that’s causing issues in the chair. Fantastic! He can also do the other one in the chair but will be longer as he’ll have to drill it. Brilliant I’ll do that in 6 months as no pain. 

Pay and am a bit confused as even with my bonus I’m still paying more than 30%. Too much pain and numbness. So I look today and call. Because I went ‘out of precedes supplier’ im being charged what they state. I lodge a complaint and I get the next month of premiums free. (And I’ll be moving next month) 

But I’m so incensed this is what our health has turned into. I had a legit dental emergency and went with the dentist who could serve me that day. And I got slugged more than if I waited two days, in pain, causing potential health issues. We’re not America and I shouldn’t have to delay healthcare because it’s not in service’ 

Because of this policy if I stay with them, if I go back to this same dentist, I’m going to be out of pocket again. If I use theirs, they won’t do it in the chair. I’ll have to go in hospital, be out under anthestic and cost them, and myself significantly more.",australia,t3_dilue1

"PSA: Internode may be storing your email account passwords in plain textSome time ago the NBN came to my area. When the order was place my ISP, Internode, sent out connection details which included the connection password for the new service. The password was the password I had previous set for my ADSL connection. This is not a huge surprise since the network connection passwords are often stored in plain text given that the physical location and hardware comprise part of the network authentication.

However, the email box Internode provides has the password fixed to the network connection password. No matter, I fixed changed the password and sent a ticket to Internode to clarify and moved on.

Recently, I received another authentication detail email from Internode, again containing the password for the primary email box that they provide. This time I follow up a bit harder and ask whether they also store plain text passwords for all email boxes for customers.

The answer to this was pretty disturbing: **yes they do** if you are an old customer. They have more than one billing system and if you are on the old one, all your auth details are stored in plain text on their servers, just waiting for a data breach.

Quoting the email response from the customer service manager I spoke to:

"DSPensioners Now Robodebt Targets?I received a vague mail from DHS about my ATO interest-earned  records being at odds with my Centerelink declarations.

I called the 1800 number (had no queue, thankfully) and was relieved I didn't owe any tax but they just wanted to make sure my DSP was ""being paid correctly"".

They want quarterly balances  from me since 2013 for five different accounts (online+savings from two banks, and a term deposit).

They read out the corresponding 27 dates which I had to copy down. They refused to email them to me and that makes me suspicious since it is possible that this is deliberate harassment they don't want documented.

I was told (by the friendly officer) there was *probably* a red flag raised because the term deposit wasn't declared (the money was declared in my overall assets total though so I didn't profit from the omission). 

That term deposit was for about a year in 2014. What took them so long? Why don't they look up the records themselves? 

Why didn't they specify this quarterly requirement at the time? Or ever? I asked if this was written as a rule and it isn't. It is like they are conducting an audit but want me to do the work for them.

I recently took up a legal battle with the [corrupt NSW Trustee &amp; Guardian](http://trusteetering.org),  creating a website exposing them, and therefore wonder if they are making life hard for me as retribution.

Then, sometime before the installation date and before settlement, an NBN contractor called me to confirm which unit was mine because he's running some cable. I didn't expect that, but okay. He's probably doing some prep work for the upcoming installation. The next day I decided to check the NBN website again and this time it said the unit was FTTP. Sweet.

Then settlement occurred and the scheduled installation date arrived. The NBN contractor came to install the NTD (for FTTP), but couldn't do so because there is no suitable location for it. He said the unit has been built to the FTTC spec but needs to be built to the FTTP spec, which means running conduit from the PCD to a suitable location for the NTD. He said there is some conduit there, but it goes up the wall from the PCD and stops about 1 metre into the ceiling. There's also a phone jack which needs to be re-routed so it goes to the NTD's location instead of wherever it currently goes (outside via copper, I assume).

~~Who's responsibility is it to run this conduit and re-route the phone cable? Should it have been done by the contractor who upgraded the unit to FTTP? Or should it have been done by the contractor who was scheduled to install the NTD? Or is it common for NBN to change the technology without the owner's permission and expect the owner to pay for electricians to finish the work?~~ My ISP tells me this is my responsibility. NBN gives enough conduit to install the unit on the opposite side of the wall, and if you don't have a power point there or want to relocate it then that's a customer cost. Seems unfair considering I don't have a power point there.

I checked with my ISP and they say they didn't request the first contractor and therefore can't see any information about it. I called the NBN's 1800 number but it appears to just be a maze of options with none of them leading to a human. My ISP has opened a complaint with NBN for me, but my only option with that is to wait for NBN to respond which may take up to 10 working days. In the meantime I can't move in until internet is working because I work from home. I am having to pay both rent and a mortgage until this is resolved.

"Family tent recommendationsHi Everyone,

I'm looking to buy a family tent and I've come across a huge variety of tents online. I've looked up Anaconda, BCF, Kathmandu and Adventure Megastore and either they're too expensive or the reviews aren't great. 

Which ones do you avid campers use for your family camping trips? We're a family of 3 (2 adults + toddler) at the moment but would like to 'invest' in one that can comfortably accommodate 4 (2 adults + 2 kids) in the near future. I don't want to be out tent shopping again after a couple of years.

We currently have a 3 person tent and that is just about good enough for 2 adults.

Any tips, ideas?

I mean yeah coffee shops open early is fine..

But Other retail shops don't need to be open at 8am

Considering the busiest retail time of the week is 4pm till 7pm Thursday in nsw it's clear people prefer to be able to shop later,from the data i have seen when i used to be at a major retailers head office

I would much rather be able to walk into a shop at 6pm after work and do some shopping,90 percent of the shops are closed by the time i can leave work..and we have not yet hit the point where i can just get it online

"English Guy Working in Australia - Recommendations Welcome!Just turned 23 year old moving to Australia alone to work for a year. 

I will be living in one place for 6 months, travelling for 1 month and then working another 5 months in a different location. 

Due to my career, I have many options as to where I can work (pretty much all of the major cities, Cairns, Byron bay etc.) 

I think I would prefer living in a city, as I will be staying in one place generally so will need to have lots of different things to do to keep me occupied for a year. I'd like somewhere with great weather, nice bars and people in a similar situation to me that I can meet. 

At the moment I am between Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney. Melbourne seems like my best bet on paper but as I will be going out at the end of Australian Summer I hear that Melbourne can get quite mild in the winter which puts me off. This makes me lean more towards Brisbane which I hear has much better weather all year. I am unsure about Perth as I'd like to stay east coast but I'm still open to it. Sydney I have heard mixed reviews. Should I be considering any other cities? 

Does anyone also have any suggestions for my travel month? Or any tips on socialising and making friends in Australia?

"What are some distinct cultural differences between Australians and Americans you notice?I've noticed a few cultural differences between America and Australia.

Americans are still quite formal when addressing people/strangers. 'M'am or Sir'

Whereas Australians are very casual and laid back.

American school children are very confident and outspoken, people who aren't used to this kind of confidence might think it's arrogance.

In Australia school children are not outspoken or confident in the same way. They keep to themselves, are more reserved and confidence is seen as arrogance. 

I think that comes down to teaching styles, American teachers are more visual and demonstrative in the ways of teaching, it often involves presenting or acting out something. Whereas Australian teaching is more rigid, you just absorb information written on a blackboard or book.

"How do we educate the Australia populace (politically)?In the last few weeks, redditors on this sub seem to have gone nuclear on the LNP. And based on the comments, there's a growing sense of disbelief at how unintelligent and ignorant the average Australian seems to be.

IMO, a key cause of this is that issues are becoming more difficult to interpret. Common sense no longer cuts it - you pretty much need an economics degree (e.g. for franking credits, negative gearing, implications of quantitative easing), a law degree (international refugee obligations) and a science degree (climate change). I personally don't agree with the notion 'it's Murdoch's fault' because I think people would come to the same moronic conclusions about complex issues if left to 'think for themselves'.

Furthermore news sources that actually distill and explain issues (like FriendlyJordies) seem to be uninterpretable to most, with content that flies right over people's heads.

I don't know if this thread will get traction, but I really want to start a discussion on how we can come together to educate the less-informed in our communities to get them to start trusting experts. **Anyone got any ideas???**

To get people thinking, here are some of mine:

* Set up weekend education courses (Economics 101, Politics 101) that people get paid to attend, funded by NGOs
* Start a left wing news outlet with outrageous headlines (e.g. ""Scotty's crashed the economy"")
* A concerted effort to get elected to community boards (e.g. local sports clubs) and introduce 'political' agendas, e.g. gender non conforming teams",australia,t3_dieb8x

"Watch out for Gumtree scamI havent sold anything on Gumtree since I moved to Australia 4 years ago and my god there are so many scammers when I tried to sell my laptop. Some were super convincing! For those that dont have much experience trading good on Gumtree, here is a short explanation on their MO and things to look out for:

Their MO

* They will ask for you to post the parcel before you receive money appearing in your statement.
* They will send you fake proof that they have sent the money and say it will take 3-4 working days for money to clear.
* They will say add little bits of detail here and there to make it more believable. The fake proof is pretty compelling and I feel like the guys who do this build an exact replica of an online banking page using basic web building techniques and running on their own computer (ie running local). 

Scam indicators

* They dont haggle price. No genuine buyer has ever offered the price I put up.
* They never ask for pick up. They will always ask you to post it somewhere.
* They insist on you posting the parcel before money is cleared to your account using a variety of excuses. They insist strongly and are very persistent.
* The top three are the most important IMO. I think there are few more such as offering you personal info you never asked, grammatical errors on their email, sending you a text message first and asking you to email them to discuss further (I mean, why not just reply to their text message?).
* Saying that they will pay to your bank account via paypal and you need to send paypal a proof of sending the parcel to get the funds cleared (this is actually not just an ""indicator"", if someone did this to you, its 100% fraud).
* I found scammers with local mobile phone numbers much easier to believe than ones that just blast you an email.

Its actually super simple to avoid this if you follow two rules:

* Sale to take place physically (ie pick up only)
* If you must send by post, only send it after money is cleared into your bank account (or cleared into your paypal). NO matter how much proof they send you that they have sent the money, dont budge.",australia,t3_di23oe

I am one of the many backpackers travelling through australia right now, and I ended up in Brisbane looking for work, which turned out to be harder than expected. I am here for 2 weeks or so now and still nothing. I got a whitecard, am doing my RSA right now and pretty much willing to do anything. 

The most curious part is that I seem to not be the only one. Just yesterday I walked through southbank with my CV and a nice lady told me that I was the 12th! guy to come by on this day. So I wanted to know, is Brisbane really that shit to find work?

And does one of you currently need a German guy to work for them? Or know where people are looking for people to work at the moment?

"Renter responsibilities upon leaving or renewingOn mobile so sorry for poor formatting. My partner and I have stayed on a 12 month lease agreement in Victoria. We are 8 months in currently and have been hassle free with our landlord. We are looking at moving out to another apartment likely within a 5 to 10 minute radius from us depending on what's on the market. As of right now, we are 90% leaning towards ending our lease when it's over in February 2020 and moving to another apartment for another 12 month agreement. However, in the slight chance we decide to stay, I'd like to ask if there are any set of actions or steps to take. I know in Victoria that we have to alert the landlord in writing 28 days before the lease is up for intending to leave and that the landlord must give us 60 days notice for increasing rent. Is there any other precautions we need to take both in the case of finishing our lease or staying? I believe by the start of January, we will have decided whether we will stay or leave. Of course this is based on what is on the market. An increase in rent will drive us to leave even more however we don't mind our apartment.",australia,t3_di1ofq

"Gaming Laptop Purchasing Advice in AustraliaHey everyone,

Given how weak the Aus dollar is, I'm looking for cost-conscious alternatives to the usual branded laptops I've purchased in the past.

I'm looking for something reasonably future-proof and capable of playing games at decent quality.

It seems to me that Metabox and Aftershock PC seem to have the most competitive pricing for the spec I'm looking for. They appear to be custom, locally-assembled machines which, I imagine, is where the cost savings are coming from. I'm swinging to this option not only from a bang-for-your-buck slant, but also because I like the idea of the profits staying in Australia.

Does anyone have any experience with either of these merchants? Can you comment on: 1. value for money 2. customer service and 3. general build quality

So as the title implies, i will be graduating in a Bachelor of Marketing in Australia at the end of this year with the aspiration of working within social media. However, I feel as though I'm inexperienced as I have only volunteering experience and retail sales experience from overseas, helping out with my family's  business store.

My initial goal was to secure a part time / seasonal/ casual job to gain some experience and I was offered  a seasonal  job but was forced to drop it because of I will be going overseas on Christmas day due to a family reason ( I will not go into detail).

Since the start of this year, I have the fear that I will graduate unemployed and won't have stability. And that all my friends are moving forward in some way. I also lack some  qualifications which I have yet to get such as a Drivers license etc.

I'm just scared of the future and I get the impression that its the end of the world and I'm just leaving university with volunteering experience. 

I intend to enter full time work within five years from now but I wanna work part time and go out there and experience other things. I'm  scared that since I'm  a graduate some people may not take me up as they would assume that I'm ready only for full time work.

Now that I am getting more successful in life (gradually) and have a bit more financial leverage I have started getting on top of health issues. I started going to a chiropractor which seemed to help short term but has had no long term effect. I thought about going to a different chiro or something and was looking online for places around my area. One local clinic had a page on leg-length discrepancy which was always in the back of my mind but just thought a specialist could diagnose that if they suspected it.  The page mentions leg-length discrepancy can be caused by fractures. Now we back track.

I was a foster child in nsw. From aged 7 to 13. Now it was a horrible experience but so are my biological parents so yeh pretty much i can’t see what is better. One thing that happened is when I was I think 10-11 I was sleeping on a bunk bed with no safety guard. I fell off in my sleep and just remember waking up to excruciating pain. The next day I couldn’t walk on my leg and had a huge lump on it. My carers at that time were relief carers and did nothing, just took me to do their boating activities the next day. 

Months later a previous pair of carers were visiting me cos they wanted to remain in contact. The female was a nurse and the male was a paramedic. They saw my leg (which still had a huge lump and was numb to touch) and told me it was greenstick fractured. I was surprised and being a 10-11 year old I didn’t know much about it. They made my current carers at that time get X-rays and the doctor confirmed it had been fractured and should have been put in a plaster cast but was now too late to do anything. 

Now being an adult, the lump took years to subside but eventually now it is just a slight deformity which can be seen on my leg, kind of a dent with a slight lump. But thinking that the pain I face every day and even the slight deformity, it shouldn’t be there cos I should have been taken to a doctor when the accident happened. I am annoyed and know well that I am paying out of my own pocket for the injury. 

I heard somewhere about statute of limitations but how can I sue or do anything when I was a kid? Even as a young adult (being a previous foster kid with no family support) it’s pretty hard to start a lawsuit on my own to even get proper healthcare. 

I obviously will go to specialists and do further investigations. It’s just hard coz it is still expensive for me. I also think about going to a lawyer but worry it will be so expensive and don’t know if it is even too late at this point? 

Does anyone know how this kind of situation would be approach or has heard some other experience?",australia,t3_dh7ag8

So today I went into EB Games for a warranty exchange, no biggie these things happen the warranty stuff went smoothly.

But holy hell does their computer system suck.

The mouse I returned was purchased through Afterpay online so I didn't use my EB World card at the time, silly me.

When searching for a transaction it is register specific (he searched two computers before he found it), their transactions are not shared.

They cannot search for the transaction based on the product barcode, name, description, online order ID, pickup barcode, or Afterpay details.

He had to manually scroll line by line until he found the exact amount for the transaction and then check to see if it was that one.

It took about 15 minutes, and by the end of it, there were about five or six very inconvenienced customers behind me.

The icing on the cake was that before I stepped up to the counter, I had to wait 15 minutes for him to do a New 3DS trade-in because they couldn't find the serial number. Don't they get documentation on where to find that information?

Our current lease is set to run out 21st novemeber, we thought we'd be good tenants and give the real estate decent notice of intent to leave the property. We let them them on Monday we won't be renewing the lease, ""yep no worries that's fine, thanks for letting us know"". 

That part is all well and good, but when I was browsing down realestate.com last night, I noticed our house had been posted for rent, again that's fine, they need to fill the house. I then check to see when inspections start as it says its available 4 days after our lease ends. The first inspection time is Wednesday the 16th of October. No one from the real estate told us there will be an inspection, in 2 working days from now. No one even told us they would be conducting inspections, let alone to close to the current date. It was also posted at 7pm on a Friday night, so there's absolutely no way we can get onto them until at least Monday morning. 

Is there a minimum amount of time they need to give us prior to holding inspections? I'm sick to death of this real estate agent (RW), they take weeks to fix anything and terrible at communication. I would love to give them an absolute earful regarding the current situation, but I just want to make sure they're in the wrong. What are your thoughts on the situation, thanks.",australia,t3_dgmti9

"Theory on the Parmi/Parma debate.So I have a linguistic theory for you all about the difference between Parmi and Parma.

so way back, Anglo-saxon hunters would refer to meat as cow, deer and pig but over in France where wealthy nobles would eat the meat, it was referred to as beef, venison and pork so depending on your class, meats had different names.

Now if we take that and apply it to today, there are two types of people, those that work in food service and those that don't and I think that's where the difference in pronunciation started, so waiters and chefs would use parmi as a shorthand for parmigiana because it'd be easier to read and write the first 5 letters where as customers would use Parma as a short hand because of how it's pronounced (pahr-muh-zhah-nuh).

Now despite how you decide to pronounce it, there's one thing we can all agree on and it's that those who pronounce it as ""chicken parm"" are weak, need to be culled and have their DNA removed from the gene pool.",australia,t3_dgo7ca

"AMA Announcement: CBC Election Night Extended AMA! (Start time: Approx. 7pm ET/4pm PT, Oct 21) (Details to be updated as needed inside)Good afternoon and happy election day eve, r/Canada!

It is with pleasure that I would like to announce a unique form of AMA that we will be hosting on the subreddit tomorrow evening (October 21st) currently scheduled to commence at 7pm ET / 4pm PT (subject to change) and with an extended run time of roughly 4-6 hours (also subject to change).

The host of this AMA will be [Jayme Poisson] (https://www.cbc.ca/mediacentre/bio/jayme-poisson), journalist and host of the CBC News podcast Front Burner. Joining her will be 4-5 panelists also answering AMA questions. 

The current list of panelists also joining the AMA are:

* Calgary Mayor [Naheed Nenshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naheed_Nenshi)
* Sun News Editor-in-Chief [Mark Towhey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Towhey)
* Political podcaster, writer, and comedian [Ryan McMahon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_McMahon_\(comedian\))
* Criminal defense lawyer [Marie Henein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Henein)

Notably this AMA will be alternating between answering questions on r/Canada and occasional appearances on CBC's televised/web broadcast coverage of election night - be advised you might see some short period where questions go unanswered for a few minutes while they are preparing for going on-air and appearing there.

Final details  somewhat in flux so stay tuned to this announcement which will be updated as new information comes in.

---

We are extremely grateful to the CBC for their outreach to engage with and inform our community on an unprecedented level this election. The experience has been thoroughly mutually positive and we look forward to a continued cooperative partnership in this area. We are also completely open to any other media organizations who wish to engage with the community in a constructive manner!

We must also give thanks to the admins of Reddit themselves for coordinating these enterprises, as well for general advice and guidance on moderation during this extremely active election period. While we cannot deny the wish for more resources and better tools remains outstanding, we have to acknowledge the effort that has been made to make the subreddit as neutral a ground as possible for discussion between people with differing political views, avoiding a single-sided 'echo chamber', while at the same time completely prohibiting bigotry and hatred.

And finally thank you to our community for being active, interested, and engaged. We ask you to do your best this coming election night (both in this AMA and across the subreddit in general) to be gracious and civil, even over the most heated disagreements, and regardless of the final outcome of the election.",canada,t3_dkmpb4

"Thank you Canada for saving my familyLet me start off by saying I'm not very knowledgeable on our healthcare system/ I have about the average Canadian understanding. I dont know anything about what's feasible on a provincial and national level and what's impossible/possible to pull off.   

My mom was first diagnosed with breast cancer around 8 years ago when I was around 15years old. They caught it early and they expected a full recovery, their only concern was her age ( relatively young to be diagnosed with cancer). She made a full recovery, at least that's what we thought, because about 5years ago she was diagnosed again. They thought they missed just a little and that it grew. She thought it was a death sentence but she kept fighting. She is the strongest person I know. 

Throughout all of this she kept working very stressful and demanding jobs in non profit organizations, she kept as positive as she could. I have an amazing step dad who was always there for her,  my brother and I did the best we could. After a couple of years of constant radiation and chemo, surgeries, she was cancer free again. Life seemed normal again, she was doing amazing work with her job, traveling, enjoying life. At this point I moved out because I was around 20-21, thought I should start thinking of school/careers.


One day a couple years ago, when I was home for the day, she called my brother and I downstairs and told us that she had been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer they said she had around 5years. We all just cried for what seemed like hours. She said it was the hardest thing she had to do, was to tell us that news. You really dont know what to do in those moments, when everyone kinda settled  down we just asked questions trying to get as much info as possible. She kept working through all of this! She would be hospitalized for 1-2 weeks and then go run a charity. She is a badass. 

And then here we are today I am back living at home, my mom is off work and doing everything she can to keep fighting. I try to get every moment I can with her. I get all my strength from her. It's given me an outlook on life as to which I cant complain about a thing. She has to face death everyday, I cant complain about my small shit. I just have to be there for her. We're about to go on a 3week vacation, my mom my bro and I and it will be the best vacation of my life.

To tie back to the title lol, Canada's healthcare system indeed saved my family. 

It seems pretty obvious to me, that if we were American my family would have gone bankrupt. Again I'm not super knowledgeable but that point has been relayed to me but if anyone could dispute that please do. The cost of medicine and the treatments in some countries is flat out scary. Especially for someone who has been diagnosed 3 times. 

My mom was a single parent for most of my life, my stepdad came into the picture about a year or so before she was first diagnosed. Together they could provide what I would call a typical middle class household. Luckily she has pretty good benefits so now that she is out of work shes receiving some money but we still need to cut costs. 

When people complain about Canada's healthcare system I cringe because of my experience with it. That's just a gut reaction although  I'm sure there are some legit horror stories. I've always been proud to be Canadian, this experience has made me truly grateful to be Canadian. My family won't be going bankrupt as we're potentially losing a loved one, we have enough money to go on a vacation and enjoy life as long as we can! 

I dont really know what else to say, I cant really expand on it further , I think you guys get the point I'm trying to make. Thanks to any who read it through! Feel free to share your own experiences with the healthcare system good or bad. 

I love you mom:) if I have the balls to show you this",canada,t3_djs24x

"Bienvenue au vendredi français! Pratiquez votre français ici! // Welcome to French Friday! Practice your french here!Bonjour mes amis,

Plusieurs usagers dans les derniers mois et dans le recensement ont exprimé leur désir d’avoir accès à une plateforme pour pratiquer leurs habiletés en français et les améliorer davantage. Dans cet esprit, nous accueillerons les « vendredis français ». Ce seront des fils punaisés tous les vendredis dans le but particulier de pratiquer, de lire et d’écrire en français. Nous espérons identifier un thème de départ pour lancer la discussion, mais toute discussion en français est bienvenue dans le fil.

**Les règles de ce fil sont plutôt simples :**

1. Toutes les règles habituelles du sous-reddit sont toujours en vigueur
2. Essayez d’écrire en français autant que possible, même si votre français est cassé
3. Évitez les discussions de nature politique pour garder l’objectif des conversations à propos de l’utilisation de la langue, et idéalement pas de façon argumentative.

Les francophones de langue maternelle et les apprenants potentiels sont encouragés à se joindre à la discussion et à favoriser les apprentissages. Plus tard, nous travaillerons à créer un insigne pour ceux qui facilitent ces discussions pour les y identifier.

Ce n’est pas l’endroit pour remettre en question le rôle du français dans la société, du gouvernement ou de la politique canadienne ou pour attaquer les communautés francophones. Le français est parlé par des Canadiens d’un bout à l’autre de notre grand pays et l’intention est ici d’encourager les utilisateurs à développer leurs habiletés linguistiques.

Vous pouvez bien sûr visiter /r/quebec, /r/french, /r/learnfrench, /r/francophonie, /r/francaiscanadien ou /r/france pour continuer votre apprentissage tous les jours de la semaine. Il y a aussi un [salon Discord](https://discord.gg/4yxpypt) disponible pour apprendre le français.
Vous pouvez aussi en profiter pour proposer des thèmes pour les semaines à venir. Si vous avez des questions, sentez-vous bien à l’aise de les poser dans cette chaîne de commentaires, ou d’envoyer un message à la modération.


**********************************************




Bonjour mes amis,

Many users over the past few months and in the census have expressed interest in a platform in which to practice their French language skills and develop them further. In that spirit, we will be hosting ""French Fridays"". This will consist of a stickied thread each Friday for the express purpose of practicing, reading and writing in French. We will aim to identify a starting theme to initiate a discussion, but the post is welcome to any discussion in French.

**The rules of this thread are fairly straight forward:**

1. All subreddit rules are still in effect
2. Try to post using as much French as possible, even if your French is broken
3. Try to avoid discussions political in nature to keep the conversations focused on the use of the language and ideally not argumentative.

Native French speakers as well as prospective learners are encouraged to join into the discussion and encourage learning. Moving forward we will be working to develop a flair for those who facilitate or are assisting in these discussions to identify them within these discussions.

This is not the forum to discuss the role of French in Canadian society, government, politics, or attack French communities. French is spoken by Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and the intent of this is to encourage users to develop their language skills.
You can, of course, visit /r/quebec, /r/french, /r/learnfrench, /r/francophonie, /r/francaiscanadien, or /r/france to go on learning on any day of the week. There is also a [Discord chatroom](https://discord.gg/4yxpypt) available for learning french.

What an election it's been so far. And the best is yet to come, right?


OK, maybe not the ""best"" — but there's definitely some excitement ahead.


The stage has been set for what should be a crucial and significant final four campaign days. For the longest time this was a static election campaign, one where the changes were so incremental you could barely detect them. Now, suddenly, things are moving fast. 


The latest poll tracker numbers (which seem to get updated every time I turn around) suggest the Liberals and Conservatives are nearly tied for the top spot after a late boost in support for the Bloc and the NDP . 


This new reality has shaped a lot of what we’ve been hearing in these final few days. Talks of minority governments, coalitions and warnings from the parties about what it would mean if the other guys win more seats than them. 


Anything could happen as the parties sprint to the finish line!


A little bit about me — I have covered multiple federal and provincial elections and have also reported from all over the world in places like Rio de Janeiro, Iraq, South Korea and Japan. I’ve also reported on breaking news across Canada, including the fire in Slave Lake, floods in Manitoba and the shooting on Parliament Hill.


In my downtime, I love to bake, read, avoid exercise and spend time with family, friends and my PVR :-)

"‘If we do nothing, the herd will certainly be extirpated’: Caribou maternity pen proposed in Nakusp, B.C.A non-profit organization has proposed a maternity pen near Nakusp, B.C. to help caribou recovery.

“We don’t want the population declines to continue marching north,” said Hugh Watt, co-chair of the Arrow Lakes Caribou Society.   


According to a [report ](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/ftp/HTH/external/!publish/Caribou%20Recovery%20Program/Herd%20Plans/FTP_upload_herd_plans/southern_mountain_south/CentralSelkirks_Draft_v1_disclaimer.pdf)on the Central Selkirk herd from the provincial government, the herd’s population was 148 in 1994.

"What is the infrastructure and administration like in such a huge country?Hey. I would ask that question in r/russia but i am not very fond of that country so here we go 😉 i am European so obviously Canada seems enormously huge to me. And it's mind boggling that you have only the ninth of USA's population while being way larger. And it's bloody cold in some parts of your country! Because of that, i often wonder, how is such a huge chunk of land administered, and what is the administration like. If i wanted to drive from the very southeastern part of your country to the border with Alaska, would it be a comfortable journey or would i (no offence) have to travel through wilderness and bad roads? Has anyone of you here even done that or do you just go by plane everywhere? Is there any civilization outside of the southeastern part with Ontario etc.? And how do the authorities know you aren't doing something illegal in one of the less inhabited provinces?

Hopefully i haven't insulted you. Thanks in advance and sorry for bad english

"I want to apply to the RCMP but am worried about two things. Any advice is appreciated.Hi All,

This is my first post on Reddit, sorry if this isn't in the correct category or area.

I want to apply to the RCMP this year but am so disappointed at the thought of not making it passed the interview stage because of this one major incident at the US border.  I'm sorry for the long post.

In 2015 I was driving to the US from Surrey, BC and my car was full of my things because I had just finished moving to another house. Yes I was stupid for not emptying out my car.  Anyway, got pulled in for inspection and the border guards went through everything and came back with a little plastic bag with  flakes of weed.  They said they found it in a backpack but I don't know how loose broken flakes could be gathered in a bag full of things, but I was in a lot of shock and really scared from that point on so I wasn't thinking straight and was too scared to question things. They took me to a room and handcuffed and searched me. I was beyond scared and holding back tears wondering what was going to happen to me.  

The weed would've been found scattered on the floor of the car if anything, not in a plastic bag.  I had to pay a fine and I have to apply for entry if I want to cross again.
Haven't applied yet because I moved overseas the week after for 4 years and moved back last year. 

Now I'm scared this will mess up any chance I had to be a successful applicant. That boyfriend is now my husband. I know mentioning this is going to cause an  investigation into his past and drug use. He's only ever smoked weed and nothing else, he's not Canadian but is a PR. Can anything bad happen to him during the investigation? Am I being too paranoid about him? 


I'm a good person who has never been in any kind of trouble, ever. I want to be a police officer more than anything but dont know how this has messed up my chances. I know at the end of the day it's my fault for not clearing out my stuff but is there anything I can do moving forward to help myself?

Edit: just to correct myself, I apologize for the wrong wording. I shouldn't have said ""interview"" I just meant the initial application process, more specifically the questionnaire at the beginning.",canada,t3_dj010m

"Fine for different province for registration and license?Hey guys, quick question that I can't find a straight forward answer for. I'm pretty sure it's illegal, but can anyone confirm and maybe tell what sort of fine it would be to have your license a different province than your registration? I still have about 10 months left on my Alberta plate (I registered for 2 years last summer) and just recently moved to the NWT and changed my license and insurance. All I can find is if your license and insurance are different, nothing about registration. I know I'll have to get changed eventually but it's just a weekend driver and thought I might be able to ride it out until next summer. Thanks!",canada,t3_di2aji

"We urge you to go to the polls! Election 2019: Advance voting is now open across Metro Vancouver, Vancouver Island and BC's Coast and InteriorElection 2019: Advance voting is now open across Metro Vancouver

As part of our democratic right and responsibility, we urge you to go to the polls! This election is as important as ever for the direction and future of our country. 

For anyone itching to cast their ballot sooner rather than later, the wait is over.

Advance voting for the federal election opens across Metro Vancouver Friday Oct. 11. Residents will have the option of casting an early vote until Monday, Oct. 14.

For advance polls, residents can only vote at their assigned polling station.

If you’re registered, you should have received a voter information card in the mail. It tells you where and when you can vote. Voters are advised to bring the card with them, along with a government issued ID that has a name and address on it (such as a driver’s license) to make the process easier.

Those who didn’t get a voter information card or if the information on it is wrong can find their advance polling station by using the Voter Information Service. Voters can also contact their local Elections Canada office or call 1-800-463-6868 to check and update their information. 

See these links:

If you won’t be able to vote on either the federal election day, Oct. 21, or in the advance polls, there are other options. Voters can vote at any Elections Canada office up until 6 p.m. Oct. 15. Voters can also register to vote by mail at Elections Canada offices in until Oct. 15.

Elections Canada offices are open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. weekdays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and noon to 4 p.m. on Sunday.

Advance polling dates:

Friday, October 11

Saturday, October 12

Sunday, October 13

Monday, October 14

"Annual Leave Hello,

I would love to move to Canada, but one thing concerns me. I live in Europe now, in my country according to law there is a 4 week paid annual leave, but most of the employers give their employees 5 weeks as a standard. In next year or two we will probably have 5 weeks by the law so possibly 6 weeks given by the employers. Also the company I work in is planning to cut the work week from 5/7 to 4/7 work days/weekends from next year. Now, I know, that there is a 2 week paid annual leave by the law in Canada which is suprising for me, but are employers giving their employees more leave as a standard, or they strictly stick to a 2 weeks? What other benefit (nonfinancial) do they offer? Is a home-office common thing in Canada? Thanks for your time.",canada,t3_dhm14q

"Bienvenue au vendredi français! Pratiquez votre français ici! // Welcome to French Friday! Practice your french here!Bonjour mes amis,

Plusieurs usagers dans les derniers mois et dans le recensement ont exprimé leur désir d’avoir accès à une plateforme pour pratiquer leurs habiletés en français et les améliorer davantage. Dans cet esprit, nous accueillerons les « vendredis français ». Ce seront des fils punaisés tous les vendredis dans le but particulier de pratiquer, de lire et d’écrire en français. Nous espérons identifier un thème de départ pour lancer la discussion, mais toute discussion en français est bienvenue dans le fil.

**Les règles de ce fil sont plutôt simples :**

1. Toutes les règles habituelles du sous-reddit sont toujours en vigueur
2. Essayez d’écrire en français autant que possible, même si votre français est cassé
3. Évitez les discussions de nature politique pour garder l’objectif des conversations à propos de l’utilisation de la langue, et idéalement pas de façon argumentative.

Les francophones de langue maternelle et les apprenants potentiels sont encouragés à se joindre à la discussion et à favoriser les apprentissages. Plus tard, nous travaillerons à créer un insigne pour ceux qui facilitent ces discussions pour les y identifier.

Ce n’est pas l’endroit pour remettre en question le rôle du français dans la société, du gouvernement ou de la politique canadienne ou pour attaquer les communautés francophones. Le français est parlé par des Canadiens d’un bout à l’autre de notre grand pays et l’intention est ici d’encourager les utilisateurs à développer leurs habiletés linguistiques.

Vous pouvez bien sûr visiter /r/quebec, /r/french, /r/learnfrench, /r/francophonie, /r/francaiscanadien ou /r/france pour continuer votre apprentissage tous les jours de la semaine. Il y a aussi un [salon Discord](https://discord.gg/4yxpypt) disponible pour apprendre le français.
Vous pouvez aussi en profiter pour proposer des thèmes pour les semaines à venir. Si vous avez des questions, sentez-vous bien à l’aise de les poser dans cette chaîne de commentaires, ou d’envoyer un message à la modération.


**********************************************




Bonjour mes amis,

Many users over the past few months and in the census have expressed interest in a platform in which to practice their French language skills and develop them further. In that spirit, we will be hosting ""French Fridays"". This will consist of a stickied thread each Friday for the express purpose of practicing, reading and writing in French. We will aim to identify a starting theme to initiate a discussion, but the post is welcome to any discussion in French.

**The rules of this thread are fairly straight forward:**

1. All subreddit rules are still in effect
2. Try to post using as much French as possible, even if your French is broken
3. Try to avoid discussions political in nature to keep the conversations focused on the use of the language and ideally not argumentative.

Native French speakers as well as prospective learners are encouraged to join into the discussion and encourage learning. Moving forward we will be working to develop a flair for those who facilitate or are assisting in these discussions to identify them within these discussions.

This is not the forum to discuss the role of French in Canadian society, government, politics, or attack French communities. French is spoken by Canadians from coast to coast to coast, and the intent of this is to encourage users to develop their language skills.
You can, of course, visit /r/quebec, /r/french, /r/learnfrench, /r/francophonie, /r/francaiscanadien, or /r/france to go on learning on any day of the week. There is also a [Discord chatroom](https://discord.gg/4yxpypt) available for learning french.

This article has all the major points on each parties platforms and what they are campigning on and is relatively easy to navigate.  https://www.macleans.ca/politics/2019-federal-election-platform-guide-where-the-parties-stand-on-everything/#directory

This is information on where and when to vote, as well as the riding candidates and to check if you are properly registered.

Green: https://www.greenparty.ca/en/platform
