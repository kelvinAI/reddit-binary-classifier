"Mere Disagreement is Not a Personal Attack This is a post I've been trying to write for awhile now but keep deleting because it's a tricky subject.

We all know what it's like to respond to someone's point and receive vitriol in return. And we've all presented an argument and felt indignant when someone disputed it. That's part of human nature, especially when we feel passionate about a subject. The internet has only made it easier to give in to that immediate urge to lash out and this subreddit is no exception. I'm not an expert but here's what I've observed in my years as a regular member.

Most of the time, the person we're responding to has good intentions. There have been many times where I got into a heated exchange with someone and thought they were being mean to me but it turned out to be a simple misunderstanding. And there have been many times when I responded to someone thinking I was being helpful and got accused of being a bad person. The weird thing is it doesn't seem to matter how innocuous the comment is but more about how much the people involved care.

Another aspect that doesn't get noticed as much is the speed at which we communicate. That knee jerk reaction we've all had that. once we get ourselves under control, are silly in hindsight. It's so easy to read a comment, immediately take offense, then blast off a response in seconds without thinking. The more emotional we feel, the faster we react. We've got to train ourselves to slow down in those situations which can be difficult to do since it goes against our instincts.

Lastly, the thing that bothers me the most. Stereotypes. As an atheist in a Christian subreddit, it's pretty obvious to me when someone has bought into the idea that atheists are angry and close minded. I'm sure that many denominations of Christianity, along with other religions, have common stereotypes that people believe about them too. The thing about stereotypes is that, although a small kernel may be based in fact, for most of us it's not applicable. There are some angry, close minded atheists but there are a lot more happy, open minded atheists. It's the same for others too.

So what do we do? Here is the advice I've received in the past that may help others. Always assume good intentions. Reread comments before submitting. Focus on the argument and not the person.",Christianity,t3_dl986s

"Just learned that a prominent atheist redditor passed away. Rest in peace. I ask you to keep him in your thoughts and prayers So, I learned today, that [u/DoctorMoonSmash](https://www.reddit.com/u/DoctorMoonSmash/), who identified as a ""Gnostic atheist"" and was an active moderator over at [r/DebateAnAtheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/) had passed away. Apparently he passed away several months ago. There is a more detailed post over at the sub he used to mod, you can see the post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/d8u7m9/we_lost_someone/).

He was raised Catholic, and most likely baptized, but later became an atheist.

I will not reveal his real name or personal info, but I just wish to commemorate him. I am not an atheist now, and had already left atheism (pretty much) when I met him over at [r/DebateAnAtheist](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/). I had a reputation of a troll over there and people were reluctant to engage me, but this person always paid attention to me, he always treated me with respect and I remember him with kindness. I feel so sad that I will not be able to interact with him again. I am happy that I had the pleasure to interact with him, engage him. As a Catholic, I will pray for him and keep him in my prayers. I ask all of you to commemorate this man and even if you do not believe, just keep him and his family in your thoughts.

"I have serious trouble with the idea of even one person going to hell. I'll state for the record that I am a Christian and that I believe in the teachings of Christ to be morally perfect but I don't come close to hitting all the checkboxes of being a good Christian. Regardless, my own fate is not what I am talking about here. I believe God makes all the right decisions and in my limited knowledge, I can't figure out long division much less the logistics of souls. 

What stays on my mind a lot is the idea of even one person going to hell. Even the worst person imaginable. Judas, Hitler, Stalin, Nero, etc. It is especially hard to think of much less egregious person going to hell. 

The reason isn't the punishment itself, but the longevity of it. 1000 trillion years means nothing in terms of infinity. It just seems like a very permanent, horrible punishment. 

I understand the crime is not believing in Jesus and or not living according to the will of God. That is the worst thing you can do. However, we are so ignorant and we're here for such a short time. Its a very short trial period to be given a death sentence. Even if we lived until the end of the universe, the punishment is still unimaginable.

Thats just for one person, but it's likely that most people are going to hell. Idk how anyone goes about their daily life knowing even one person could be in hell forever. It affects my daily life just thinking about it. I don't know enough to justify the punishment. In my limited knowledge, I just wish they could be forgiven. I don't think anyone should torment forever. Really grasping what forever means, I don't know how anyone can sleep knowing even one person will be tortured forever. 

It also has changed the way I treat people. I figure odds are if I see two people, two out of three of us tops are going to hell, so I might as well be nice to them. I've almost become benevolently nihilistic about it. like I don't stay mad at people anymore, because theyre probably going to hell anyway and so why make this short time any worse than it has to be. I also fret over every sin I commit as if it's the one thatll result in me being in pain forever and ever. is it even worth 100 billion going to heaven if one person goes to hell? Like I'm not virtue signalling, this eats me apart.I would rather share heaven with the a dastardly guy that did the worst things in the history of mankind than see him in hell. Its too heart wrenching. What should I do with these thoughts? Regardless, the answer is I'm just not wise enough to understand the ways of the Lord. Its not like a lot of people are even given a fair shot from my perspective, and even if they were, they aren't perfect.",Christianity,t3_dl2juq

"I'm trying to figure out what i believe about christian sexuality and well, this post is a mess lol. I'm 26 years old guy and ive always had a very negative view of sex and masturbation due to the fundamental upbringing.

Lately Ive been exploring the idea of what is ok for a christian to do, such as masturbation. I ran across a site called marriage heat and it is so interesting to me because of its idea. If I'm understanding right, its where people write stores that are arousing in nature for others to be aroused by right? And within the context of  christian sexual ethics? I'm not use to being somewhere  where stuff like masturbation is openly talked about.

I'm still figuring out where video fits into all of it. I mean obviously I enjoy it but I don't know if its ok. Ive seen different opinions on here about it.  I don't just want to watch porn, ive done that before but its not really what I'm looking for. In all honestly I wish I could just find a video of a normal christian married couple having sex but obviously thats not really something easy to find. This is embarrassing but the video on the home page of Marriage heat advertising ""ignite""? Seeing that was a HUGE turn on because they were loving and kind and of course she was beautiful. Even if there was no nudity.

I have the fantasy (because I don't know if it would be sinful or not and I don't know if I should even think about it) of just finding other single people (of both sexes) online to talk about this type of stuff about. Similar marriage heat  I guess but with other single people? Yet I wonder if that would not be crossing a line into sin. But where does sin start? If I masturbate alone to a story is that sin? what if I was to look at a photo of a pretty woman naked? what if I watched a married couple have sex? What if I talked to a single woman who had posted a naked photo on a website? At what point is it crossing into sin? I don't know. I want to enjoy my sexuality but also don't want to sin.

I'm so tired of sitting on my hands about all this and just wish I could talk openly with someone about it where they could understand my guilt and my desires to figure stuff out an explore some.",Christianity,t3_dlbk4b
"Feeling very discouraged about pursuing my dreams after a major fail in videography...advice? I feel discouraged and feel like giving up on videography.

To make a long story short. I'm a new videographer and I got a big opportunity to film and do a concert recap for one of my favorite artist. I was doing for free and using it for experience too. 

This was my very first concert recap and this artist is somewhat popular so I knew if I made a good impression this could be a big break for me to also connect with other artists and get jobs doing this.

Also this artist previous concerts recap was veey basic and kind of terrible. So I had new and cool and Ideas and wanted to offer something different to the table that this artists doesnt have and also make name for myself.

I met the arists and get to film him and he liked my new ideas a lot and so I thought he liked me and everything was going to be great and I was sooo excited.

So I get home to edit the footage and a lot of it was very dark so as I tried to up the exposure it was horribly grainy. So I thought of a vhs effect to safe it and it looks cool.
But then my laptop crashed as I was editing and I wasnt able to repair it in a timely manner due to lack of finances.

I tried to contact the artist about it, but got no response. Next thing you know I see a concert recap of a new show he did and he hired someone else and the videographer did a GREAT job and all the ideas I had he had this guy do my ideas instead. Now the artist and the videographer is getting a ton of praise and I'm sitting here with nothing, but discouragement and embarrassment.

"I used to not believe in the word of God. Today I was both baptized and I had my first vision This weekend has been incredible. First I went to a Pentecostal church where people were worshiping in a prayer room. The entire place was filled with incense. I felt like I had walked into heaven, that's how strong Gods presence was.

Today, after getting baptized (In the name of the Father, the son, the holy spirit, and Jesus Christ of Nazareth) I went to meet up with a friend I hadn't seen in a year. We used to speak negatively about Christians and churches together. I told her I felt like she had been going through a rough time. She said she actually felt suicidal. I suddenly had a vision of her being a toddler in kindergarten, with pig tails, and I just somehow knew she used to stand up for kids who were getting bullied. I told her God loves her so much, and shes always been so kind. She asked me how I knew that about her. It was the most incredible experience. Gods heavenly love filled me up and I just knew with complete certainty that was a fact about her past. I had never had a prophetic vision before. It was so wonderful and now I understand why some people start crying uncontrollably in front of His presence. Its just so overwhelming and glorious. Christ saved her life, and she's a believer now, because there's no way I could have guessed that. Her style is like punk rockish. She has tattoos and red dyed hair, with mostly black clothes.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to share this because I used to be completely atheist. I took pride in being in an intellectual and often challenged and trolled many believers, both online and in person.  But now I see that religion and science can co exist; that the gospel is completely true and goes along with the way the world is. The big bang theory sounds so close to genesis's description of how God spoke the universe into existence with the phrase ""let there be light"". If you read Genesis, creatures were created before there were man and women. There also were men and women before Adam and Eve. That ties in with evolution.  [https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/1-26.htm](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/genesis/1-26.htm)  God is so loving and holy. I'm so glad there's a reason for all of this existence. We're meant to love each other and walk in obedience with Gods perfect will. We're only humans and our intellect is limited and that's why we need His guidance. Plus He only wants to guide us into heaven. It's our choice. We have free will

But we all fall short, because we're imperfect, and that's why we need Jesus Christ to save us. He's so good to us

"Long post - Episcopal or Catholic? I'm posting this on the Episcopal and Catholicism subreddits as well, but I'd like to hear what you all have to say and hear any advice you might have too.

&amp;#x200B;

	I am currently in the unenviable position of being torn between two churches, the Episcopal Church and the Catholic Church. I am being drawn to both for different reasons, but through the past few years of losing and finding and struggling with faith I have found myself time and time again drawn to the Catholic Church. I have attempted RCIA three separate times but never completed it. I attended Mass when I was in Basic Combat Training as well, but stopped going to any religious services and lost my faith again in AIT. Now I find myself drawn to the Catholic Church yet again, but certain issues I have with doctrine and practices lead me to question whether the Episcopal Church is not the “correct” church, if not a better fit for me. I feel that since God wants all His children to return to him he speaks to everyone in terms of what is most effective for that individual, which means I’m not sure if every Christian denomination, if not every Abrahamic sect or even world religion, does not lead to salvation. I, however, lean towards Christianity, specifically the Catholic, Orthodox, Episcopal, and Anglican churches due to their historicity and tradition, rather than depending on select individuals interpretations of scripture.

	I lost my faith when I was 12 years old. Although I had heard God before when asking Him if I could tape my Bible back together (He said yes), I spent a lot of time on YouTube watching science videos, which lead to videos of Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, and Richard Dawkins among others making very convincing arguments about how God is not real, and if He is He’s in fact negligent if not evil. Being a 12 year old who wanted to be right and the smartest guy in the room, I fell for these arguments despite their lack of nuance and often times their intellectual dishonesty. However, as I entered high school I felt a spiritual emptiness, and bounced back and forth between interest in paganism, Judaism, Islam, some sects of Christianity, and even Satanism. It was at this time as I first began struggling to find faith again that I felt a powerful presence that inspired fear.  

	I was driving down the road with my girlfriend and I just felt an overpowering feeling that told me I was doomed if I didn’t change something, and I felt that it was God or something like it that told me so. So I began looking into different religions again, and after some time I came to digging into Catholicism again. My mom’s father was raised Catholic, and although he later left the Church I inherited a pendant of Mary he had. This and my experience, as well as my girlfriend and her family being Catholic (although they never went to Mass), inspired me to look deeper into Catholicism. I started trying to pray the rosary, and I felt good and peaceful afterwards, but I wasn’t sure if it was due to the prayers themselves or its resemblance to meditation.

	However, as I was praying the rosary one day I felt a warm, loving, powerful embrace that made me feel protected and loved and cared for. I looked around to see if I hadn’t noticed my mom coming in and hugging me but no one else was there. I’m convinced it was the Holy Spirit and/or Jesus I felt, if not Mary herself.  

	As time went on and life kept getting the better of me I continued to lose and regain and lose faith. Now, years later, I feel like I have to commit to growing and nurturing my faith, through the proper church so I don’t fall victim to secular trappings or anything like that. However, I now have issues with some Church doctrines that are preventing me from converting to Catholicism outright.

	Firstly, the role of women in the Church. They can teach RCIA and confirmation classes, can help with Mass and the Eucharist, but cannot be ordained as priests or even deacons. Why? The only explanation I’ve ever been given or read is either it’s how it’s always been, or that Jesus was a man so only men get to be clergy. However, Jesus must’ve been a man because no woman would’ve been respected as a spiritual leader in his time. And God has no gender, since he is above it, so why can’t women be ordained? In this I feel the Episcopal Church is right. If men and women come together in holy matrimony to make one whole, then why can’t that same logic apply to preaching or administering Eucharist?

	Secondly, the role of LGBT people. The Episcopal Church not only accepts them, they have no qualms ordaining them or marrying them in the church. The Catholic Church however says that if they lead those lifestyles they are living in sin and therefore they cannot support them in doing so. Why is this? So long as their relationships are healthy and loving and they want to live in the Holy Spirit, why does it matter who they love or how they identify? Regarding gay marriage, I’ve heard the argument that marriage is a religious institution, and Biblical marriage is between a man and a woman because they come together to make one whole and bring together all types of love (empathetic, friendly, romantic, and unconditional), but with adoption being an option for gay or transgender couples I see no reason why that cannot still apply. I’ve also heard it said that it’s not inherently sinful to be gay so long as it’s not acted upon, but why would God then make them gay? Knowing the difficulties they would face in being Gay – judgment from the Church, society, health risks, etc. - why would one choose to be gay? Therefore if they are made gay or transgender (for the same risks apply if not even more dangerously) why would it be sinful to act upon it?

	Thirdly, the role faith plays in politics. I have a friend who is so devoutly Catholic he attends Latin mass, and he says that as a Catholic he cannot vote for a Democrat since they as a party are pro-choice. However, although I personally support pro-choice policy I am not in favor of abortion any more than the Church is; that is, outside of rape, incest, and risk of severe birth defects or life threatening situations, I am opposed to abortion on moral grounds. But as I feel the purpose of the state is to serve its citizens, I feel that the federal policy should support safe and legal abortions, not to enable bad things to happen but to help those who make mistakes or have bad things happen to them recover and do better in the future, such as in the case of unintentional pregnancy. Am I not allowed to have that stance because of my faith? I have heard of liberal Catholics that believe more closely to how I do, but I have also heard many denounce their legitimacy as Catholics for being so liberal.

	Fourthly, the role of sex in relationships. I understand as a rule being opposed to extramarital or premarital sex. It often clouds judgment and leads to nothing good. However, if I am in a committed relationship for years and sex is a regular part of it, bringing us closer and bringing a physical intimacy that can’t be experienced through cuddling or holding hands, is that a bad thing? The risk of pregnancy can be, absolutely, but if we use contraceptives that is avoided. The Catholic Church says contraceptives are sinful, as sex is for procreation, but there is so much more to sex than its biological function. If it’s done in a safe, constructive, committed, and loving context, it brings those involved closer together and is a great and beautiful expression of love and devotion. The Church believes this in the context of marriage, but even then it denounces contraceptives. However, the Episcopal Church says marital contraceptives are fine, as it’s done in marriage. I feel their more correct on this issue regarding that. However, I’ve also heard in RCIA that if my girlfriend and I have sex it’s not sinful so long as we get married later on. Which I don’t have a problem with, but that seems like an interesting stipulation to me.

	I also have some issues with Episcopal doctrine. Chiefly, their lack of belief in the legitimacy in praying to Mary and the saints. As I mentioned above, I felt a powerful loving presence when praying the rosary, and I can’t see how that is against God when I can feel holiness through it. And praying towards the saints asking for guidance/advice or to pray on ones behalf doesn’t seem much different to me.  

	They also seem to break from legitimate tradition regarding confession. I agree that one should be able to pray directly to God for forgiveness, but priests having a direct line from John to forgive sins seems to be legitimate as well. I’m not certain but I believe Catholics can also ask for forgiveness directly as well, but there are benefits to confessing sins to a physical person as well and being given steps to aid in repentance rather than simply doing what feels right when it could end up being misguided or not effective on its own.

	Another is the primacy of the Pope. It’s not a dealbreaker for me one way or the other, but tradition legitimately gives great authority to the Pope. Although I also agree with the Orthodox and Episcopal Churches heads being “first among equals”, I have no issues with how the Pope as the head of the Church works, including how the doctrine of papal infallibility actually functions (with councils being called rather than the Pope just stating something when he feels like it).",Christianity,t3_dl8zle

"Struggling with heart issues, pray for me Request for healing and also a little  testimony I suppose. 

Hello, I'm 23, for the last four years I have been struggling with health issues, but only received an actual diagnosis last month. The diagnosis was a heart condition. I pretty much spent all my college years ill, in fact I didn't even graduate because of the health issues. It all started in 2015, in 2017 my health got so bad I could barely walk. Doctors couldn't find a diagnosis so they used the ""you're crazy"" card and made me see psychiatrists.  My parents believed the doctors that I was crazy. They insulted me repeatedly. I was hurt beyond measure but I learned to forgive them.

It was in this year that I became a born again christian. All of my health issues, anxiety, depression, pain vanished. It was unbelievable! I even went back to university, and held a job, something I thought I couldn't do! It didn't happen over night but He was always gradually helping me out during those dark days. I spent the majority of 2018 in good health (with a few episodes of feeling ill, but nothing like 2017.)

Fast forward to 2019 and my health issues have returned stronger than ever. I remember watching endgame in theaters, I was feeling horrible the entire time. I didn't know why my health issues returned but then recently I realized it was because of my porn and masturbation addiction. How could you keep divine healing if you're constantly polluting your temple? He who pollutes their temple will be destroyed by God (Forgot what verse that it, I think somewhere in 1 Corinthians.) . 

In June I almost had a heart attack after work! I rode in an ambulance and had to stay in the hospital overnight. They knew I was having heart issues, but I passed every major test so they released me. I took the heart medication they gave me, but it eventually started making me feel worse. My cardiologist didn't take me serious when I told him the medication was making me feel worse.

 Anyway, in late July 2019 and August  2019 my health reached an all time low. I could barely walk up the stairs without passing out. I was constantly short of breath and felt like I had about 4 near heart attacks. Praise the Lord that I didn't have one. Finally in September I was diagnosed with irregular heart rhythm. After four years of being insulted by doctors and my parents, I finally received a diagnosis! I was ecstatic, but also saddened. They scheduled me for a heart procedure in November (a few days after my birthday which is a bummer) I'm not super nervous about it, but I would love to avoid it. If you're wondering why it took so long for a diagnosis, it's because many doctors made mistakes. They assumed that it was unlikely that a young person was having heart issues so they just overshadowed it. Even though the signs were there (constant tachycardia, abnormal ekgs) they didn't refer me to a cardiologist. I really don't know why, but I forgive them for their mistakes. 

The only thing that has made me feel better physically and emotionally is God. He was with me at my best and with me at my worst. When I was insulted, He comforted me with his anointing until I shed tears of joy. I want to go into ministry because God has been so good to me, how could I not serve the One who helped me? The only reason why i have strength now and am pretty happy is because of my Lord. 

Now in September of this year I started feeling better after constant praying. I would always start feeling bad after watching porn and p.m.o. I had a porn addiction that I tried to cut multiple times, but now I'm really trying to cut it out like never before. I know that illness would have not returned if I just stayed away from sexual immorality. The most I've gone in this period is 15 days, I'm on day 4 now and I don't want to mess up again.

Well thanks for reading my short testimony. If you made it this far I ask that you pray, stand and agree with me that my heart is stabilized and beating normally in the name of Jesus. God bless!",Christianity,t3_dl7fnr
"Yesterday, I asked the Lord to help me introduce my girlfriend to Christianity. Today, we broke up. The two are unrelated, but a part of me feels like they aren't regardless.

I never really did get to talk about it with her. I just fell apart afterwards. And I still am. It was my first relationship and we only lasted a little over a year. I failed to make her feel special despite all of my efforts towards it.

I will probably fall back into depression for a while, but I'm sure I'll eventually get over it. It was my introduction to Christianity that pulled me out of my last one. 

I'm just putting this here to get my mind off things.",Christianity,t3_dlafx3
"I used to pray, and now I don‘t. I stopped praying at some point, maybe two years ago or so. 

I was raised Protestant-Lutheran, I was baptised as a baby and chose to be confirmed. My mum is quite religious. When her mum (my nan) was dying, my mum drew a great amount of strength from her belief that my nan would meet my grandpa in Heaven. It was beautiful. I never shared the belief of Heaven and Hell. 

When I started praying as a child, I was taught that God is not someone you ask for a wish and then he grants it, that it doesn‘t work like this. I usually prayed in uncertain times but I prayed with gratitude. I would usually pray to thank God for my friends, family etc. I rarely ever asked for anything. One of the few times I did, the exact opposite of what I hoped for happened. The prayer was along the lines of ""Thank you for this, I am so grateful for this, please may I keep it for a very long time"" and then the ""thing"" disappeared/ended/etc. That made me sad. 

I‘ve stopped praying now. I was told that God is 
1) omniscient AND
2) omnibenevolent AND
3) omnipotent. 

When I look at the state of the world, it is obvious that he is not. He may be any two of these things at any given time but never all three simultaneously. I work with people who suffer from horrible illnesses. I cannot look at them and think that God is all three. Either he is unaware that these people suffer and thus doesn‘t relieve them; or he is malicious and thus doesn‘t relieve them; or he is both aware and well-meaning but unable to relieve them. Or he is non-interventionist, he doesn‘t have a plan for anyone or intervene in anyone‘s life. I find that difficult to believe because I once felt him intervene in mine. 

I know people say that it is all God‘s plan somehow and that God means well. But how is letting someone die of horrible causes a well-meaning plan? If this is God‘s plan for these people, I‘m disappointed in God. :-(",Christianity,t3_dl35ic

"Married to an unbeliever, is there hope? I was raised Christian but as I got older I stopped praying, stopped going to church, never read the bible,etc. My life was mainly partying, drinking and smoking weed... I met my husband when I was 21 and in the middle of my crazy life. He was also raised (somewhat) Christian and had a similar lifestyle, but he’s an unbeliever. At the time, that wasn’t really important to me but up until recently (after being together for 5 years) something happened in my life that made me seek God. I repent daily for everything I’ve done and most importantly for walking away from God. I’m working hard on being a good Christian and I’ve told my husband how important this is to me now. He’s been very understanding, and although he still doesn’t fully believe (in Jesus mainly) he’s still willing to come to church with me, hears my Christian music and podcasts and has agreed on baptizing and raising our children Christian... but he’s still an unbeliever. He believes there is “a God” out there but he’s unsure of who he is. He mainly doesn’t believe in Jesus because of scientific stuff.. he’s the guy that watches a documentary on something and then that’s it, until he watches a different one.. his views basically change ever so often depending on whatever scientific show he’s watched recently but he does believe there is a God out there but just unsure if it’s “the Christian God” or not. When it comes to Jesus, he tells me it’s really hard for him to believe in something that sounds so unlikely and that he needs some proof for him to believe. He thinks the Bible might not be fully accurate because he says it’s like stories that were passed on and written so long ago that could be like that broken telephone game, but he’s starting to believe in the main essence of it, like the 10 commandments and the teachings behind the stories but not the stories themselves (if that makes sense). He tells me he wants to believe and he’s hoping for something that will make him change his heart as he would like to be a Christian but he tells me he can’t fake it and act like he believes. I keep praying for him and praying that God will talk to him somehow.  The crazy thing is that he’s such a good hearted person and becoming a Christian would almost be no work for him... he truly cares for others, he’s not selfish at all and he basically tries to be a good person every day. He literally behaves like a Christian, except he’s not. I guess my question is, is there really any hope for him? Has anyone been in a similar situation where it turned out ok? I feel guilty for being with an unbeliever... I don’t want to get punished for it and I also don’t want to end my marriage and break both of our hearts... I selfishly decided to stay with him when I was young and didn’t care much about religion and now that I’ve changed I don’t want to ruin his life. He literally tells me I would ruin his life if we ever divorced (i feel the same) so please don’t tell me to leave him ... we truly love each other so much and have an amazing relationship.. can’t get enough of each other even after 5 years. I want to have hope that he will convert one day. Any advice on how to keep sharing the Word of God with an unbeliever would also be appreciated.",Christianity,t3_dlaalk

"God's punitive judgement on wayward nations after many warnings (worth reading) Click link to read full article[https://www.controversyextraordinary.com/2014/12/gods-punitive-judgment-on-wayward-nations-after-many-warnings.html](https://www.controversyextraordinary.com/2014/12/gods-punitive-judgment-on-wayward-nations-after-many-warnings.html)  


An atheist scientist has accused God with a flood of adversarial adjectives. In his book, he wrote -

""The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully."" (God Delusion. Chapter 2 p.31)

Breaking down the paragraph, here is the list of the freak accusations against the Creator by the freakiest of freaks, Richard Dawkins:

1. Unforgiving control-freak
2. Vindictive
3. Bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser
4. Misogynistic
5. Homophobic
6. Racist
7. Infanticidal
8. Genocidal
9. Filicidal
10. Pestilential
11. Megalomaniacal
12. Sadomasochistic
13. Capriciously malevolent bully

Unforgiving Control-Freak?

Unfortunately, for this scientist, his understanding about a creator in charge is nil. Anyone accusing somebody to be an ""unforgiving control-freak"" without basis is a freak himself like Dawkins! The less-than-zero god of Dawkins is all of these, yet he is petty?

As recorded in the history of God’s nation, because of human greed and caprices, the Israelites suffered with rigor in the hands of the cruel Egyptians for four hundred years.

GENESIS 15:13-16

*13 And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and* ***they shall afflict them four hundred years;***

*14 And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.*

*15 And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.*

*16 But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again:* ***for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full***\*.\*

Why did it take that long? God is a forgiving God, waiting patiently for people to repent and realize the consequences of their iniquities. The timing was not only for the Israelites, but also for their enemies.

His being a forgiving God spells His long-suffering for the Amorites. Who are these Amorites?

The Amorites were an ancient nation mentioned frequently in the Old Testament. They were descended from one of the sons of Canaan ([Genesis 14:7](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Genesis%2014.7)). In early inscriptions, the Amorites were also known as Amurra or Amurri. The “land of the Amorites” included Syria and Palestine. Some of the southern mountains of Judea were also called the hill country of the Amorites ([Deuteronomy 1:7](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Deuteronomy%201.7),[19-20](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Deuteronomy%201.19-20)). Despite their strong numbers and military might, the Amorites were destroyed due to their worship of false gods. Israel’s conquest of their land was part of God’s judgment on the pagan Amorite culture. The Amorite nation had plenty of time to turn from their idolatry, but they despised God's goodness and longsuffering and refused to repent ([Romans 2:4](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%202.4)). The Lord’s judgment upon them was severe, and anyone who imitates their rebellion will eternally regret it ([Romans 2:5](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Romans%202.5); [Matthew 10:28](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matthew%2010.28); [Revelation 2:22-23](http://biblia.com/bible/esv/Revelation%202.22-23)). *(Ref:* Norman Geisler and Joseph M. Holden, *The Popular Handbook of Archaeology and the Bible, Harvest House Publishers, 2012).*

II PETER 3:9

*The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness;* ***but is longsuffering to us-ward***\*, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.\*

This is because His desire is for all men to be saved.

I TIMOTHY 2:4

***Who will have all men to be saved***\*, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.\*

This long span of years - four hundred - proves God's patience and forgiveness for the abuses of the Egyptians against the Israelites and the grace of His forgiveness and patience towards the Amorites (used interchangeably with Canaanites). But seeing that the hardness of their hearts and the degree of corruption the Amorites have accumulated in their ungodly way of life, God ordered the Israelites to get rid of these people. This was after God liberated the Israelites from Egypt. For this, isn’t Dawkins accusing God for being ""bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser?""

For us to understand the order of God, let us look into model cases in the Bible of annihilation of nations. In various verses, one can read: ""wipe them out,"" ""throw them into confusion,"" ""make them turn their backs and run,"" ""drive them out of your way,""""strike them down"" ""dispossess,"" ""drive out,"" ""thrust out,"" ""destroy them,"" ""subdue them before you,"" ""annihilate,"" ""deliver them over to you,"" ""defeat them,"" ""give kings into your hands,"" and ""wipe out their names from under heaven."" But according to Analyst Glenn Miller (ChristianThinkTank.com, 2000), when these are grouped into two categories- dispossession versus destruction - the first comes out with 33 occurrences, and destruction only11 occurrences, with a ratio of 3:1.

Recognizing the intent of the 'punishment' explains the order. Accordingly, God was destroying a culture and its carriers, and not necessarily all the individuals in it. In brief, the model cases, as explained by Miller were as follows -

(1) In the story of **Sodom and Gomorrah,** the cities were destroyed without human agency, and that the vegetation was destroyed. God used some type of natural disaster to accomplish the destruction.

(2)The **Flood of Noah** was the largest annihilation/judgment to date and it involved people, animals, and much vegetation (Gen 6-8).

(3)The **Amalekite initiative** looks like an ordered annihilation;

**1 Samuel 15:3 (KJV)***Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.*

The annihilation was to punish the Amalekites for what they did to Israel when they waylaid them as they came up from Egypt. The Amalekites are a predatory, raiding, and nomadic group.

(4) In the book of Jonah, what is there is an 'averted annihilation'.

**JONAH 1:1-5 (KJV)**1 Now the word of the Lord came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.3 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the Lord.4 But the Lord sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep......

In short, the people of Nineveh, confronted with warning, responded and averted the annihilation.

From these model cases, the obvious pattern is that the annihilations are judgments over cruelty and violence of an extreme and widespread nature, preceded by long periods of warning or exposure to truth and therefore, with opportunity to change outcomes. But the list of Amorite/Canaanite ""religious"" practices included: (1) Child sacrifice (with at least some of it in fire); (2) Incest; (3) Bestiality; (3) Homosexual practices; and (4) Cultic prostitution (Miller, 2000; Hobrink, 2011).

Reality dictates that there are people who have no right to live in a civilized society. Governments of almost all civilized nations impose capital punishment for people who are found to be prejudicial to the existence of the better elements of society.

The Bible teaches that children, unlike their evil parents, are welcome in heaven.

MATTHEW 19:14

*But Jesus said, Suffer* ***little children***\*, and forbid them not, to come unto me:\* ***for of such is the kingdom of heaven.***

Here’s an archeological account on the land of Canaan suggesting that children were also afflicted by the sexually transmitted diseases prevalent in Canaan during the time that God commanded Israelites to claim the land of the Amorites!

God's express command to Israel was to destroy or drive out the Canaanites (Deuteronomy 7:2, 3). And Joshua went at the task in dead earnest, God himself helping with mighty miracles. In reality, GOD DID IT.

In excavation at Gezer, Macalister, of the Palestine Exploration Fund (1904-09), found, in the Canaanite stratum, which had preceded Israelite occupation, of about 1500 B.C., the ruins of a ""High Place,"" which had been a temple in which they worshiped their god Baal and the goddess Ashtoreth (Astarte). It was an enclosure 150 by 120 feet, surrounded by a wall, open to the sky, where the inhabitants held their religious festivals. Within the walls were 10 rude stone pillars, 5 to 11 feet high, before which the sacrifices were offered. Under the debris, in this ""High Place,"" Macalister found great numbers of jars containing the remains of children who had been sacrificed to Baal. The whole area proved to be a cemetery for new-born babes.

Another horrible practice was that they called ""foundation sacrifices."" When a house was to be build (sic), a child would be sacrificed, and its body built into the wall, to bring good luck to the rest of the family. Many of these were found in Gezer. They have been found also at Megiddo, Jerico and other places.

Also, in this High Place, under the rubbish Macalister found enormous quantities of images and plaques of Ashtoreth with rudely exaggerated sex organs designed to foster sensual feelings.

So, Canaanites worshiped, by immoral indulgence, as a religious rite, in the presence of their gods; and then, by murdering their first-born children, as a sacrifice to the same gods. It seems that, in large measure, the land of Canaan had become a sort of Sodom and Gomorrah on a national scale. (Ref: Halley's Bible Handbook, Archaeological Notes: Canaanite Religion, pp166-167)

The Macalister mentioned here is Robert Alexander Stewart Macalister (1870-1950), an Irish archeologist who was responsible for the excavations at Gezer, one of the earliest large-scale scientific archeological excavations in the region. Gezer is said to be between Jerusalem and Jaffa. (Ref: [http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/azekah/azekah/2-uncategorised/156-cont-23](http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/azekah/azekah/2-uncategorised/156-cont-23))

The height of the evil being practiced in Canaan was their cruelty against their children!

DEUTERONOMY 18:10-12

*10 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,*

*11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.*

*12* ***For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD***\*: and\* ***because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.***

Canaanites butchered their children and burned them in the fire to make an offering to their false gods.

JEREMIAH 19:5*They have built also the high places of Baal, to* ***burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto Baal,*** *which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:*God is a God of justice. A God that allows ample time for repentance; but justice requires equity and equal rights. We are allowed to move with freedom, to live in comfort, to satisfy our desires carnal and spiritual, but not to the expense and detriment of others who have the same right as our own!MATTHEW 7:12*Therefore all things* ***whatsoever ye would that men should do to you***\*,\* ***do ye even so to them***\*: for this is the law and the prophets.\*God commanding the Israelites to annihilate the ungodly Amorites and Canaanites is God's wise way of instilling in their minds that they must live in God's justice if they have to live in peace. Cleansing in a civilized society is a must!

LEVITICUS 20:10-11, 16

*10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.*

*11 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.*

*16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.*

"Rethinking The Trinity I find the trinity to be one of the most difficult facets of the Bible to come to terms with. Not because I don't believe it exists. Because I think there has to be a better explanation. I've done some research on it, and would like your thoughts on this. 

He answered, ""Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself."" Luke 10:27

This sounds like four parts: mind, body, soul, and heart. But one has to represent the person as a whole. Repeatedly in the Bible, people are referred to as souls. \[[Exodus 31:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%2031.14); [Proverbs 11:30](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Prov%2011.30)\] So we will use the term 'soul' to define the person as whole. 

If we were made in God's image, shouldn't this parallel Him? If our soul consists of three parts: mind, body, and heart. Could it be that the these systems mirror the divine parts of the trinity? If that was true, God the father would be the mind. Jesus would be the body. And the Holy Spirit would be the heart.",Christianity,t3_dlc93w

"A story Today marks my 21st birthday. My brother texted me to wish me a happy birthday, my Mamaw gave me $45 today and wished me a happy birthday, my Grandad sang to me at work, and it was a good day. I worked hard today, came home to a house with no electricity. We had an outage for a few hours. 

My father called my Grandad from prison. I mentioned that I had sent in a phone bill so he might be able to call me in the future. He complained that he doesn't understand why that was such a hard task for me to complete and why it took so long. After this, I went home. 

I cried and stared at the carpet beneath my feet for a while. I prayed to God thanking him for remembering my birthday when my own father couldn't. Today was supposed to be a special day. I tried to place the cork back in the bottle to restrain my emotions another day, when I heard a bird chirp outside my back door. 

Looking through the window panes on the aforementioned door, I saw a bluejay bird. He was perched upon the roof of our neighbor's house. In his beak was a large walnut half the size of its head. He tried to swallow the walnut, but his beak was too small. A second bluejay flew atop the fence between our back yards. It watched the bluejay with the walnut in its mouth until the walnut-bluejay hopped from the roof and behind the fence. Following this, the bluejay upon the fence watched me for a while curiously.",Christianity,t3_dl8m6c

"Cover to Cover Bible Reading with Pastor Don Costello  

Jeremiah 3, 4: All through the Bible the Scriptures warn us concerning our thoughtlife, the thoughts we allow in our minds. In our reading today we see how God warned Jerusalem along the same lines. Jeremiah 4:14 “O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?” The Hebrew word for “vain” is defined as “strictly nothingness; also trouble, vanity, wickedness; specifically an idol, evil, false, idol, iniquity, mischief,  naught, sorrow, unjust, unrighteous.” The command to control our thoughts is consistent throughout the Bible. In Romans 12: the Apostle Paul exhorts us about the power of a sanctified mind. “Don’t be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind (Romans 12:2). I have found that as I control my thoughts and focus on the LORD, I definitely feel better, at peace. #growchurches #covertocover

2 Thessalonians 3: In our reading today we learn that individuals referred to as wicked or bound by sin are not thinking straight. 2 Thessalonians 3:2 “And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.” The Greek word for “unreasonable” literally means “without place”. This same word is also defined as “absurd”. It is safe to assume that wicked behavior is fed by absurd and unreasonable thinking. No doubt why the Lord in Isaiah chapter 1 exhorts all men and women, “Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool (Isaiah 1:18). Saints, let’s be reasonable, for His glory, and our own good. #growchurches #covertocover",Christianity,t3_dlaw4c

"I'm a strong Christian, but struggle with abortion. Can anyone offer assistance? So let me explain my stance. First of all- I don't believe there should just be ""pro-life"" and ""pro-choice"". I'm neither of those. I don't believe it's as clear cut as either YES or NO. 

A lot of the situations are very conflicting to me. For example, let's say someone is tragically raped and impregnated. Should they abort that child? A large part of me says no, the child didn't do anything. And I believe that. But there's a strong chance that the mother will never be able to love that child. But I don't think that's grounds to up and abort it, right? It could be put up for adoption. But I know it isn't always as easy as that. 

Another situation that's easier is if the child is going to be seriously disformed. Mentally or physically. I dont mean something like missing an arm, but something actually serious. At that point I can understand it being *mercy* to abort it. But even though that one is easier to me, it's still not 100%. 

And here's my biggest issue. Let's say someone gets pregnant, but they are in a bad situation. So that child will be raised in poverty, and quite possibly will be emotionally, if not physically abused. If abortion is legal, let's say this person goes and gets one. Is that right? I can't say to myself it is. Because it's still robbing the child of a life that may not be that bad. But I just don't know! I hate calling it murder, because I know how hard it is on people and it's not some easy choice, but I believe it's taking away that child's chance of a life. 

And another, if a teenager gets pregnant. I can  say, if they're at an age to which is wouldn't be physically dangerous to them, they shouldn't abort it. And even saying that is tough, because it must be a horrible situation to be in. But people know how sex works. They know the consequences! And they have to live with them sometimes. And that's my biggest thing against abortions. Most isn't rape or incest, most is people just not wanting the child. And that's just not okay to me. But I understand their point of view in certain scenarios, and it's really confusing and conflicting. 

I'd really appreciate any assistance that can be given to help me wrap my head around this. Thanks!

"how would I overcome black magic Basically I was surrounded by the occult as a kid and believed sexual abuse was involved.

Along with that, when I was very dumb and under control of black magic( age 15- 20, I am now 21) I opened portals to the demonic through weed, alcohol,  swearing, clubbing, partying, promiscuity with probably witches deceiving me, excessive materialism.

I do none of those things now and am in a committed relationship of 9 months. I believe everything is a portal, even the internet and I am much more aware of the adversary. I do see a slight improvement in my life and feel closer to god; but I am still having panic attacks and dissociation where I do not feel in my body. Or chronic bad luck where I cannot get traction in my life it seems. These panic attacks are usually triggered by flashbacks to trauma, regret, guilt, shame or by others I see in public who give off a dark vibe. Today I was walking through the mall to get to the busses and I almost had a total meltdown. I cannot even describe what triggered it- I was just walking and felt like the room was closing in on me and I was about to die. My whole being got tense and I felt disorientated and went from being calm almost into a full fledged panic attack. Malls are the worst place to be, I truly hate busy places with strangers especially as I am trying to heal. But I need to get through them to get to the busses

i always feel hypervigilant and on guard. Sometimes my joints feel like they are burning, which I think is a black magic attack.

"Are there any denominations that recognize civil marriages? tl;dr: My fiancee and I are getting married by a justice of the peace, but I want to join a Church denomination. Are there any denominations that will recognize our marriage so that I won't be living in sin (i.e. so I can take communion)?

My fiancee and I are going to marry soon. She was confirmed Catholic but became an atheist, and I was baptized in a Congregational Church but never practiced Christianity. She wants to be married by a justice of the peace because she's turned off by the ""do you promise to obey your husband"" question that priests ask during marriage ceremonies (she's a bit of a feminist in addition to being an atheist).

I recently became more interested in practicing Christianity after I spent some time reading Greek and Roman classics and discovered a philosophical thread of continuity between the ancient philosophers and the early Christian faith. I'm looking for a denomination, and I started by visiting a Catholic parish, because the older denominations seem to have preserved more of the philosophical thread I referred to earlier. The priest told me that I couldn't take communion unless my fiancee and I were married by a priest, and if she ""was open to having children.""

After talking with people on Reddit, it seems that, unless I persuade that my fiancee be married by a priest, there is no way I could ever take communion with the Catholic church. I'm looking at other denominations but I'm not sure I'll ever be accepted by the Christian faith. And I don't want to join a watered-down denomination that accepts everyone regardless of how antithetical their behaviors or beliefs are to the faith, or lacks any connection to history -- I \*want\* it to be acknowledged that I'm a sinner, not have the Church tell me whatever makes me feel better.

"Filosophy Sneak Peek 2: Miracles An excerpt that attempts to clear the air around the day-to-day events that are usually sidelined as ‘Miracles’ due to it being indescribable by humans at any single point of time. The excerpt is part of a chapter titled **‘A Beautiful God’** in my book-in-the-making **‘Filosophy – Setting fuzzy facts straight’**.

**Miracles** are **not** those that, as assumed by the world today and has been assumed ever since the day they were first witnessed, **happen in a way that is far-fetched for the rules of the world to provide for its occurrence** but rather is one which is **beyond the contemplation of man at any given point of time** with due recognition of the knowledge possessed and experiences faced at that very instant.

**An event, occurrence, action or process** that was **considered** a **miracle** a couple of decades ago can very well be **dismissed** as a **normal possibility** today thereby making it an **entity whose what’s why’s where’s and how’s have been explained and detailed well.**

In that very regard, in a scientific sense, **the noble works that doctors carry out, with the help of the tools** that they acquire through the principles of a lot of other scientific fields, in order to save lives will most certainly be **considered a miracle by Adam and Eve**, who we consider our foremost forefathers, or for that matter even the people belonging to the Adivasi tribe of India today.

Not to mention, some of the customs that the Adivasi tribe practice may be lame to us but when thought out more deeply can incite us in realizing that they too have a miraculous way of getting the task at hand done.  Here, **both the works of the doctors** and the **stupendous innovation that characterizes the working mechanisms of the tools** that the former use can both be considered miracles let alone the former alone being considered one.

**To both Adam and Ev**e, even the **process by which fire was discovered** or how the first group of humans who came up with the idea of a wheel by rolling down circular objects down the hill **would have both constituted the idea of miracles** let alone the possibility of carrying out a heart surgery. A mobile phone would have been a miracle to those who spent weeks and months to hear back from the ones with whom they communicated by posting the letters that they crafted out beautifully with a feather and some ink at the end of it.

Why consider the olden days, even today for those of us who don’t understand the technology that powers most of our electronic devices and gadgets, a mobile phone included, all of these would make up as a bundled group of miracles whose thorough understanding we may never attain in our lives. **It is assumed here that people understand that miracles are nothing more than wonders, wonders which are too brilliant to be achieved yet happen between the blinking of our eyes.**

So when people think of the **miracles performed by Jesus Christ**, it is only normal for people to assume that He is doing works that would by a normal person, on any given day, with the knowledge or skills that he or she possesses, be impossible to be carried out. **One must understand that all the miracles stated before the point immediately above about that of Christ are those that have used the laws of nature for its occurrence.**

**Not one miracle has been carried out such that it alters the law or even if it does in some scientific cases, it would be based on various altered outcomes of the law at the maximum and never out of a nonexistent base which very often is one of the basic laws of nature.**

For example, an iPhone was not brought out from outer space, not at least in my knowledge, but rather was brought into one piece with the help of various elements and minerals that were mined out from the core of the earth in a hardware perspective while the software of the same will have been built with the help of minds that worked towards bringing about an Operating System and other related software entities that would do the role that the producer would do for the consumer, in providing for the needs of the latter without the interference of the former. Now, if the battery that holds charge in the iPhone, which enables the consumer to use it with mobility, had never got drained out, then we will be right in claiming that it is truly a miracle, one for which there is no possible explanation ever, for such a thing to happen. Even in such a case, we are most certainly aware that no miracle that we claim it to be has the potential to break the laws of nature as both creation and sustenance of the same needs the conformance of some law or the other to assist it, hands down. That’s how nature works, in case we have any doubts about that.

**So what matters most here is just whether the action that we have seen** with our eyes or heard with our ears and most importantly understood with our hearts and minds are **conforming to some law** and here, there is always a possibility that it may conform to a law that we are not aware of, or the basis of which has not yet been established.

A person living during the stone age who, for the first time without any prior knowledge or awareness, experienced an apple falling on their head from a tree or a huge rock rolling down a hill thereby making them run for their life, will most certainly assume that some evil force which they are unaware of is trying to use some natural elements against them. **Though from time to time** **such things happen and are considered either miracles**, if they happen for the good of someone or something, or omens, if they happen for the converse, **it is not until it is established as a normal event by scientists such as Isaac Newton**, who confirmed that both of these examples are ones that happen due to the object, either the apple or the huge rock, experiencing the gravitational pull of the earth, that people start accepting that no major force played truants against them in specific. Even then you will most certainly have chaps here and there especially in countries like India who would like to stick to their superstitious beliefs.

The only question here would be, **why out of all of sudden would such a law have its changing effect when all along they were keeping in harmony with the same law?** Well, this is where some preceding action, either of the person themselves, or of a congruently effective natural event would have played a crucial role in deciding the turn of events. It could very well have been that the winds blowing through the region of the apple tree, at that very instant, would have been both exceedingly and unusually high so much so that the stem gave its way to the same thereby owing to the unfortunate fate of the person, on whose head it fell on.

In case of the huge rock atop a hill, it could very well have been that the person, whom it was chasing, was, not very long ago before it started rolling down, responsible for pushing away a relatively small piece of rock upon which its whole weight was resting upon.

The only question here then is what or who instructed the winds to blow too strongly at that point, in case of the apple tree, or what made the person do something so silly, in case of the chasing rock and to answer such a question momentary explanations of the same wouldn’t suffice.

In the latter case, when it is assumed that it is the folly of the person that caused the rock to roll down the hill and make them run for their life, we must remember that there are instances where people don’t really understand why some acts have come out them, either good or bad. **This is true as in the case of Peter in the Bible who swore to Christ that he wouldn’t betray the latter but went on to do so not once but thrice, leaving aside all the wonderful teachings and days that he had spent learning and moving along with his divine master.**

**What Peter can, and would most certainly have, taken as his consolation at the end of it all is how his life was turned downside up just because he chose to live on**, and not end his life with guilt and regret like Judas Iscariot, and came in contact with his resurrected master and willingly with complete dedication, took on the task bestowed on him to lead more sheep onto the shepherd’s care.

In such cases, **it is only logical for us to understand that just as revolutionary acts happen for the greater good**, or are at least assumed to be for the same in cases of those that don’t truly happen for it, miracles are intended purely for greater causes to be achieved.

**In Peter’s case, his folly allowed Christ to make him realize that a transformation of the highest order is in the cards, a transformation that would make his faith rely not in himself, rather in Christ.**

**If a person can understand this transformation of faith without experiencing it, one can only assume the greatness of that spirit** but I doubt that such a thing can happen in the modern world because to truly rely upon God, there most certainly needs to be a transformation – again one which makes us realize that God is the most stable entity to rely upon than our own selves. And indeed, **once we learn to abide by our wonderful Creator, we ensure that our souls slowly start reflecting a nature that is of that divine being Himself** so much so that our souls can not only be trusted by ourselves, but also by the selves of other neighboring beings, truly so too.

The major aspects to be carried away from here are not just the what’s and how’s of the miracles that happen from time to time but also the why’s and when’s of the same and knowing the latter is of higher significance since the former determines something that can be established due to its unchanging nature while the latter has a direction of its own which cannot be determined by mortal beings.

**If Jesus Christ’s miracles, such as the acts of bringing the dead back alive, curing lepers of their ailment, walking on water and the turning of water to fresh wine, which are often considered lame or not even taken into consideration due to the vague claims behind the same, are to be understood, you need to go nowhere beyond Science, particularly the part of the same that yet remains to be explored despite the centuries that have passed with humans trying to learn from nature.**

**In that, Science being a language of observation and results must be understood as explorative and not conclusive of aspects that yet remain mysterious or in the words as put before – miraculous, because what lies ahead for every observation of nature is more than what lies behind and this can be agreed upon by atheists and believers equally.**

Now, to explain the above mentioned miracles of Christ in scientific terms, we are going to need to make some assumptions which one day we again assume would become scientific principles or laws that ensure that any man could do the same unless of course God doesn’t permit it by hiding the reasoning of the same from man in order to maintain the divinity of Christ and more importantly of the act itself.

By considering the above mentioned explanation for the happenings of miracles and their purposes, let us now assume that the act of bringing back a person from death or removing leprosy from a person or walking on water or turning water into wine happens based on a law of nature that has been written when the earth was created.

Now, if you or any other person comes in contact with the spell or command that ensures that such a law is triggered, it can only be imagined what we would do with it. Since believers know that Christ is the Son of God, as claimed by himself and because we believe in Him and His words, it is normal for Christ to know the ‘Abracadabra’ that made the acts possible.

**If observed stringently, we can conclude that the only assumption made above is that a law behind what we call miracles exist thereby making them normal acts since what triggers the law would have been established by the time the air behind the assumption is cleared.**

It must also be remembered that an ordinary con artist can also do the more subtler miracles mentioned above such as the walking on water and turning of water into wine but what gets established there is not the law but a way by which the law’s consequences can be replicated and to be fooled or not by the person claiming to have known the ‘Abracadabra’ behind it is our choice, a choice that we need to make very judiciously and soulfully. As Christ had reminded us, **‘Many false prophets will come’ and ‘Ye shall know them by their fruits’**, the only prayer we can afford to have here is that more people are made aware of what the truth is and more importantly what the truth can be and cannot be deviated into.

The answer to miracles, as discussed above, comes not from religious claims but from a mix of religious and scientific claims and indeed it is in accordance with **Einstein** saying, **“Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.”**

If a person repeats what the passers-by during Christ’s crucifixion said, ‘If you are the Son of God, bring yourself down from the Cross’, then it is only safe to assume that they are yet to understand that the what and how has been answered but not the why and when, thereby giving primary importance to the will of God, the purposes of God.

The first aspect to be realized when we think of God, if we believe in Him that is, is that He is the creator, the contemplator of this universe and what matters above everything else is His purposes as no creation would be meaningful without a purpose. We, almost in all spectrums of life, have people saying – the ends can be met at any cost, either in terms of minds, money and its related luxuries, etc., but that which matters the most is **‘what are we going to achieve, what’s the purpose behind all of this’** and if that is set out right, then all the ends of the world can be shaken to get it done.

We often ask, why some people are more blessed than the others, why the good are considered the chosen ones of God, as is mentioned in many cases in the Bible itself, and also as to why some people have it much easier through the different phases of their life than others, indeed with a benchmark set for all while questioning, and the most convincing yet simple explanation for it is that God’s laws have been set in place for the sustenance of all living beings.

You may have asked for the intervention of God at times in your life, perhaps at a time when you were having faith, but may have got dismayed because of the silence from the other end, but one must realize that intervention means mishandling the free-will that God has given us and a start for such things would mean a never ending strand of interventions which would seem unnatural of God. Laws make up for the interventions that need to be made by God as is it in the case for any human law that has been put in place in order to provide for a peaceful living of all men.

Now, the circumstance where we expect God’s intervention is when either our fellow men or we ourselves, owing to our own folly, do something that tears apart the peace that is meant to be maintained thereby expecting a divine hand to restore back all the peace. **The only counter question in such a circumstance would be, why a man who is interested in this peace and expects God to provide for the same doesn’t take willful steps to ensure the same and in the argument of it all, all that is lost is merely sensible reasoning.**

Just as ‘Fortune favors the brave’, **God’s laws are destined to favor those who strive for the truth** and goodness, as we may all agree, is just a persona that is reflected by the constant dwelling of truth in one’s heart.

**Now, once we abide by our Creator, it wouldn’t be a surprise if He assists us with the laws that are persistent across the horizons of nature, that which are both understandable by mortals** and not and with that assistance, we could make a whole lot of positive difference in the world and there can’t be any argument over that.",Christianity,t3_dl4y5f
"A quick question. Is it ok to touch yourself? I have been looking around reddit asking this question. I have gotten everything from “it makes you blind” to “its natural and enjoy it” and I only got 1 message suggesting it’s sinful. Is it. (13 btw)

How do we obtain eternal life? ,Christianity,t3_dlb300
"Hello. It's me, that 24-year-old South American guy who had asked for your prayers. I am back and I just need to say something which will be long... I prefer not to question or wonder so much why I am making this post. Excuse my wording because I am just, I don't know, spilling what is coming to my mind.

So a few weeks (?) ago, I was fed up and made a post asking for your prayers and vented a lot in it and also in replying to the kind comments for support I received, venting about my life as a whole and whatnots.

So it was a relief, but as I know my own proceedings by now after years doing the same thing, I just vanished without leaving a trace, brushed off all those words as ""too good"" or ""charismatic"" and got back to ""I will try to make through another day until that fateful one comes"" mood, spending my days in an immense feeling of numbness and emptiness. 

It didn't take long, once again, before I was doing the same ritual: isolate myself from family, spend hours researching on suicide, reading and browsing lots of Christian websites and blogs for answers and blah. Have done this countless times already. 

So I have to say, last week was pretty rough. Having about taken 3 pills of Xanax a day over the weeks before and thus having run out of all medication, because I had run out already of Prozac which I take daily and it is not so simple to obtain such medication here, I think I felt too, overwhelmed? I don't know, but I felt extremely depressed for my...circumstances and some, family issues which I believe are not really my business but I just keep minding them trying to understand the reasons why they are there in the first place.

With this, I got to know a lot about suicide, because that is just all I thought of every single day of the week. I did learn various Christian opinions on it, and also...methods.

Thus, I got to learn: I am not strong enough to kill myself. That takes a whole other, deeper level of despair or resolve to commit, as I got to learn. There simply seems to be no painless way out of life. Even what they do tell us is painless, is actually not, according to research. Looking at you, carbon monoxide. Our bodies seem to be wired in a way as to avoid death at all costs, so for every one story of suicide we are told, there are ten other untold stories of attempted suicide, which cost the protagonists sometimes even a few of their brain functions. In sum, there is something sinister and very eerie about suicide in a state of despair and it is a level of derangement I haven't attained. 

But I am stupid, so in my lunatic rationalizations, I try to ""hasten"" the day by doing small, petty things that might bring about some disease or increase one's chances of early depart, instead of outright killing myself. Less sinful and painless, right? Sounds so.

Like I said, last week was tough, so I went a bit further than I usually do. As in a fit of curiosity, I managed to very easily create a highly dangerous substance with items available at home in a simple cup, following this one method apparently once popular 10 years ago in Asia. It was a gas, suffice to say. I didn't know it was going to hurt so bad though. Omg, did it hurt. I had to take my last 3 pills of Xanax that afternoon so I could fall asleep because it hurt and it didn't stop. I am still coughing a bit to this very moment, but I think it is nothing major because I am much better and it was too little gas.

Following this, two days later, it fell on me what I have already mentioned about suicide. I don't believe I have what it takes to kill myself and I just, like I always do every 2 months for years now, collapsed at late night, about 3 am, and just sobbed before God asking to forgive me, and help me, and all. Nothing new here.

This is was all on Saturday, so when I finished praying I went to sleep and followed as usual. Been spending a lot of time doing the same thing, just reading answers from Gotquestions, JW.org, TGC and just whatever Christian study and opinion I could find for the so many questions I have in my head, never finding satisfying answers to them because it just feels like there are things the Church prefers not to give too much thought to.

Anyway, today, Monday, I did something very simple and which I hadn't done in a long time: check the news. I hadn't even planned on doing that but there were some articles in my feed which caught my attention. So I went on reading news after news...

And here I get to the gist of this post: Gratitude. Gratitude. Gratitude. **Gratitude**.

I do believe it was like some answer from God to a prayer someone or more people have been saying over me, because it was like I felt really, very sorry before God for my attitude last week and before. 

If I were to tell the shocking, awful, sickening, revolting, perplexing events taking place only within my country, because all news but one were from here, it shouldn't be a brainer for someone like me to understand human life **is** really like thin vapor, that we are **all** subject to pain in a world where sin now reigns since Adam and Eve, that we really reap what we sow and if God really gave us free will, then nothing but grace and mercy from God will stop a monster from, in their free will, doing the most horrible harm to someone.

Those news went from people dying from such a baffling thing as cable charger electrical discharge to children as young as 8 months being abused by their own family.

I don't believe there is anything humanly possible to comfort a mother who suddenly loses her 25 year-old son to a coward murder by gunshot when being robbed while working as an Uber driver, or a child who from age 5 to 10 suffered abuse in the hands of some ghoul, and even worse, sometimes when that ghoul is family.

It dawned on me and I just felt so ashamed of myself. I have had countless, innumerable miracles happen to me and my family if I am to merely look back and see where my life is at right now. God always abundantly lavishing grace and mercy in our lives.

I am not saying we should just ignore all our problems. I still have to work on it and I am the kind of person who one day decided to refuse to cede to the common argument ""there are people worse off"" to talking back that another's starving doesn't make me less hungry, or knowing about the neighbor's smallpox doesn't cure me of my wounded knee or sinusitis. I know it sounds extremely selfish and egoistic, and while I believe it is still true, from now on I want to approach this fact in a less tart and surly manner. Do we all have problems? Absolutely. Different categories and sizes and even viewpoints, but we all still have problems.

What I am trying to express is that sometimes people might feel guilty and ignore a need or problem in their own lives because there are people worse off by all technical means. I know people who suffer for things like not being able to have children, or not getting that promotion, or not finding love, while there people whose love life and promotions are the least of their worries, because they are under abject poverty, or have lost someone dear to them to a criminal, or have suffered abuse. Instead, I believe we should just work on **solving** our problems in some way, regardless of their nature, because the same God gave children to Rachel, healed Naaman, rescued Daniel, uplifted Joseph. God is God. ""Lack"", ""dearth"", ""miss"", ""shortfall"" are not words befitting the God as described in the Bible. I don't believe there is ""ying yang"" with God. He is perfect and for there to be written ""streets of the city were made of pure gold"", it is hard to believe that like pagans with their gods for both wealth and poverty, health and disease, salvation and violence, God makes pain an end to itself. If there is pain on earth, it is because of sin, and if we have to make a choice of leading temperate lives sometimes, it is because we as sinful humans are prone to sinning if the flesh is too well-fed and thus need discipline of some sort. That is how I see it, at least...

**And yet**, I just want to say again, **gratitude**. I need to incorporate this concept into my life. Yes, it makes you want to cringe and cry when reading on BBC how nations like Finland, Japan and New Zealand can be so advanced by all human measures while yours is socially so chaotic, but regardless, a heart of gratitude should most importantly be sky-high above that. On a personal and familiar level, God has always been extremely merciful, and graceful, and wonderful and just so amazing I couldn't ever be thankful enough. I can make good claims about lots of personal experiences in the past, which I took for granted, and this is so amazing from God because many people, as I have learnt, can't do the same, most unfortunately. Nothing good is for granted, because this world is utterly evil, and the devil and sin have wrought grievous destruction in so many lives. No wonder God calls Christians to make the difference and show love and give help. The world *needs* every bit of goodness it can get.

I still need to learn many things about life and just stop fearing the worst. If you know me from my last post, you might remember my revolt and anger about my circumstances and how afraid I am of the future, and what is in store for me. I just need to force myself to believe that it is okay to do or desire something as long as it is not a sin, ""don't attach sin where there isn't any"", even if God might later have something else. That, as I have been told multiple times, the Bible and reality are filled with way more stories of wondrous miracles and deliverances in earthly lives than those of martyrs like Stephen (by all accounts, I am nothing like a martyr, I am merely OCD-level afraid of having the same fate as they did). Dream, plan, work, sow, reap, live...I mean, life is still life, and this is a relief. I am told that all the time. Follow the script until God says otherwise. Want something? Fight for it. Dream. Sow and reap. I do feel like churches sometimes put too much emphasis on the ""all things work for good"" on the here and now while it is not 100% certain that all Christians will see it until their fateful encounter with Jesus, but what can I say? Maybe it is 80% right, as in, in 8 out of 10 cases? Just a visit to any church to see that most Christians lead normal lives. Just hope to be one of the 8. Not every Christian will be the next Paul to live a life of so much struggle. And regardless of circumstances, Christians are told to always be hopeful, and rejoice, and believe...

So that's why I will once again ask you for your prayers so I can overcome this inner turmoil of fears and doubt. For my **mental health** as well. I am not spiritually mature enough to understand many concepts like ""faith"" and ""hope"" (as in, what for?) but what I experienced today about **gratitude** was fantastic. It has to be the answer to some prayer. 

Thanks and sorry for being long-winded.",Christianity,t3_dl4rl2
"Prayer vs. Technology at night &amp; in the morning Given some of the links between social media use and anxiety/depression/loneliness, I was curious about what the Bible had to say about media use. One thing I noticed is that people spend a lot of time ""screening"" in the mornings and at night... and those are ideal times for prayer and/or reflection.

In Scripture, Jesus was depicted praying in the early morning (Mark 1:35), and at night (Matt 14:23, Luke 6:12, Gethesmane, etc). The Apostolic Tradition recommends morning prayers before any tasks are undertaken, and I'm sure many traditions and denominations have prayers and routines specifically for morningtime. Plus, there's the age-old image of children praying before bedtime, hands folded.

All this to say, has anyone else been thinking about this stuff? Instead of prayer and reflection, we're consuming content on social media that keeps us occupied but not growing. Misery seems to ensue.

PS: This is a great blog post that I came across in a Christian Facebook group - the author came to similar conclusions and has some great how-to's on limiting social media use:  [https://nolongerbechildren.com/2018/07/03/facebook-sanity/](https://nolongerbechildren.com/2018/07/03/facebook-sanity/)",Christianity,t3_dl1f94

I've heard numerous opinions trying to justify all the pain in the world. Read theories that stated it's all about free will. 

Maybe you too will go ahead and say ""Oh, but God didn't make them go into that cellar, it was their choice."" Still, why would God let all of those kids to become orphans?

Why couldn't he just help them escape alive from there? They literally died while help was on the way, from a stupid, pointless accident that I find hard to believe was part of a bigger plan. They were were very faithful people too.

"Don't Bite the Shepherd [Hebrews 13:17] &amp;#x200B;

&gt;***Obey your spiritual leaders, and do what they say. Their work is to watch over your souls, and they are accountable to God. Give them reason to do this with joy and not with sorrow. That would certainly not be for your benefit. - Hebrews 13:17***

I know that oftentimes this passage can be used as a cudgel by church leaders who tend toward the abusive side, but this reveals a great deal about how much of a struggle it is for church leaders to adequately and joyfully lead a church body that is constantly biting them.

I've been in the ministry for over 15 years...served in several church denominations across 2 different states, and I'm here to tell you...the story is the same. We don't know how to treat one another.

Pastors and church leaders get frustrated and angry at and then abuse church members.

Church members get offended by, angry at, and then abuse pastors and church leaders.

Both sides seem to think they are THE coin, not realizing they are but one side of the SAME coin.

When I look at how a healthy church ought to function (Ephesians 4:15-16) I more often than not see a very different picture from what we see in today's church. According to Ephesians, when everything and everyone is functioning as intended...the following occurs...we...

1. Speak the truth in love
2. Grow in EVERY way more like Christ
3. Fit together perfectly
4. Help each other
5. Become healthy
6. Experience growth
7. Become full of love

I recently posted something about not beating the sheep [HERE](https://eagerfortruth.com/2019/10/02/dont-beat-the-sheep/), but I knew I couldn't just explore that side of the coin...I had to address the other side...which is the sheep biting the shepherd ([HERE](https://eagerfortruth.com/2019/10/21/dont-bite-the-shepherd/)).

It really is quite sad to me the way we treat one another.

Jesus said that the world would know who we belong to by the love we have for one another...and yet, we look more like a dysfunctional family going through a divorce and fighting for custody...than a family that loves each other even through the hardest of times.

I understand that we will frustrate one another...we will anger one another...we will offend one another...but how we choose, as a church body, to respond in those moments will be the ultimate defining factor.

Church splits occur over the dumbest of things.

People leave churches over the most ridiculous things.

Pastors and Church people treat one another like they are one another's greatest threats and enemies...when in reality...they themselves are their only threat and enemy because they are defeating themselves.

I say all of this to simply suggest that we can and must do better. I say this for the love of the church leaders and for the love of the church body. Unless we find common ground and build one another up instead of tear one another down, we will constantly be at war with one another and be rendered useless in our culture.

"Could really use some prayer currently.

"The more you know how corrupt this world is, especially in places of power, it comes off as less of surprise that they crucified Jesus, The God of Love and Justice. There are places where Christians disappear just because they are Christian.  People of different belief systems see the Religion of Love as a threat.  Nothing is more alluring in life than love.  Nothing is more powerful than love.  The Gospel story is that love is so powerful it defeats even death.  So people who worship idols or want worshiped themselves still persecute Christians to this day.

Even in places of relative freedom of religion, the powers at the top are thoroughly corrupted to many degrees.  You can't really get elected unless you take bribes or your campaign will not be seen from a marketing standpoint.  Since basically everyone is bribed, and main stream media runs as extensions of political think tanks, policy is put in play that is bad for the people while they say why it is good for you.   High rent, housing prices and homelessness even among our veterans are one of many things that are a result of such policy.  Others say the deliberate gutting of the middle class so the country is more feudalistic is another thing.  So even in the US, the guys at the top aren't even good guys and gals though they want to be seen as such.  Are we better? We try to be, but until you remove bribery from elected officials and places like the FCC, things will probably get worse.

The corrupt leaders we see in so many other countries are willing to let their people die, in order to secure more power.  With the guns/butter slider, there are places like Yemen and North Korea where they starve their people on purpose to keep them under control.  All this corruption of high places where leaders are okay with anyone dying to get them more money, power and the illusion of respect makes you think...  Would a guy like Jesus all about goodness and love make it in many places in the world today?  A guy like Jesus today might still be executed today.

"In regards to God not physically proving himself what would be the reason? Why atheism is looking for God where he isn't.. We are told no man has seen God at any time. 

We are told God desires us to feel after and find him and that we live move and have our being in him

If we have our being in him ""Naturalness"" is part of this.

Really think about this... Why can God not be seen and why is the only sense we get found in feeling after him?

Tying this to us being Temples of God..

He created a creature that can't physically see him but can spiritually feel after him to get a sense of him. 

What would be the purpose? My best explanation is that God and man are one. God desires oneness. He does not desire to appear as a blob in the sky and say I am your God. This is not the point of our creation to bow down and worship God as if he needs anything. God would rather create us as Temple he can be manifested through 


Through us God is manifested. God doesn't want a relationship with us and him as if we are separate but rather one.  And that can only happen if we know him spiritually.

The way I see it is God created man to be gods within creation and instead of God being shown physically apart from us it is known spiritually.

It is likely this way because God loves our individuality and sees it as a part of his body in ways we don't understand.

16 **Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?**

"Peace Of Mind Comes Before Peace Of Heart &amp;#x200B;

[Peace of Mind](https://i.redd.it/hd0so095axt31.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Peace Of Mind Comes Before Peace Of Heart

Every now and then, something comes along in our spiritual reading that stops us dead in our tracks and takes up permanent residence in our minds and hearts. In this case, the thing that struck me was literally about the mind and the heart.

Check this potentially life-changing excerpt from Servant of God Fr. John Hardon’s book, Retreat with the Lord: A Popular Guide to the Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola (pg. 99):

Peace is the absence of conflict. It is the tranquility of order. Immediately, we must distinguish peace of mind from peace of heart. Peace of mind is the experience of knowing the truth. Peace of heart is the experience of doing God’s will. There can be no peace of heart unless there is first peace of mind. I must know the truth before I can choose the true good, which is what God wants me to do.

I wish I could bold every single part of that paragraph! Meditate on each sentence. Really take it in! Can you see why we have so many souls in pain, having no peace? They are “doing” without first knowing.

Think of these quick examples: If I don’t know what marriage is, but only act according to what I feel, then how will I find peace in marriage? If I don’t know that God made male and female to be different and complementary (even while equal in dignity), then how will I know how to be a woman relating to a man? If I don’t know that human life is sacred, inviolable, and made in God’s own image and likeness, then how will I know that abortion, or IVF, or assisted suicide are intrinsically evil? If I don’t know about redemptive suffering and the stages of holiness, then how will I find peace and even joy in the crosses I am given? If I don’t know basic Catholic doctrine, how will I avoid falling for lies leading to darkness?

There are so many anguished, lost, unmoored, desperate souls out there, precisely because they don’t know what is true. They wander through their days reacting only, basing each belief (which is really opinion) and each act on their feelings. And our culture of relativism—which promotes disconnection from God, family, tradition, and even our own bodily nature as male or female — feeds their unease and discontentedness. Nothing seems trustworthy or real anymore, and we see the increase in anxiety, panic, depression, and even suicide all around us.

But if we know the Truth, if we know that we are standing on firm rock and not on shifting sand, then we can have the confidence to move and act. Even if the acting is painful, and even if we suffer on the journey, we know we will not be swallowed up and that we can stay on course. This is peace. Peace is not the absence of pain and suffering, it’s the absence of confusion, chaos, conflict, and disorder.

Peace, as Fr. Hardon says, is “the tranquility of order” — God’s created order.

So, if we are seeking peace of heart (and who isn’t?), we must not skip straight to indulging our emotions and feeding our desires; that will not bring peace at all, but only more distress.

First, we seek and find the Truth with our minds, and then we conform our lives to what we now know.

“I must know the truth before I can choose the true good….”

"The purpose of the Incarnation was not merely to save us  We are to be more than saved -- we are to be glorified (deified). Even without the fall, God intended to glorify us, but because of sin, God first had to take care of sin so his desire for us can be fulfilled:

"Here's what I know Let's get one thing straight alot of you ""Christians"" are not Christians; to be a Christian means to be a follower of Jesus Christ and the majority of you are not. Qucik interjection here, you Catholics know this: no where are we called to pray to Mary, no where is it stated that she should be exalted higher than Jesus for even Mary repented of her sins, your whole religion is a joke, encased in darkness woe to you and the pope Blasphemers the lot of you. Now, Should you so claim to be Christian you better make darn certain that you're a follower and abiding in the word and having the word abide in you, to put things into perspective the majority of you are believer's not Christians. I've been sworn at, belittled, mocked and had persons filled with pure arrogance come at me and tried to exert their Christian ""authority"" over me. When it comes down to it there is no compromising the Gospel; Homosexuals who continue to dwell in their sin while claiming to know Jesus will go to hell, CHRIST makes us turn away from our sins and no longer wish to participate in it. Jesus Christ calls us to DENY ourselves, pick up our cross and follow him but I guess y'all skipped over that part. Many of you do not read your Bible everyday, many of you still love the world more than Jesus HOW DARE YOU. We are to be conformed to the Image of his (God's) son not of the world; We cannot be of the world and of the kingdom of God for the Bible says you cannot serve two Masters for you will end up loving one more than the other. Also, No one is required to go to church, we are the church and if the church is corrupted stay away from it!! A relationship with JESUS CHRIST is your number one priority should you wish to call yourself a Christian, this thread has forgotten the message of the Christ, a spit in the face of Jesus Christ; Remove the veil of darkness from your eyes and see the light before it's too late. We are in the last days and if you disagree read Revelation, read Daniel, isaiah and Ezekiel as a matter of fact READ your BIBLE EVERYDAY, all of it not just what makes you comfortable and to the rebukers, proud, arrogant slanders Woe to you worker's of iniquity, ye who are of the world are no brother or sister of mine 1Corinthians 5:11. This is for the Lukewarm Christians on here who have a form of godliness but deny the power there of. To those of you who abide in the word of God and wish to be a true disciple of Christ please continue on your path of righteousness and do not let any man tell you you can't. I say all this because I have seen too much in Jesus to not be all about him I used to be a Satanist, I used to be a worker of iniquity and alot of you brought judgement upon me without knowing me you are no better than the Pharisees in Jerusalem. The devil has a hold on alot of you I'll pray for his hold to be broken but as for my future on this page here, it is non existent. Look not to others for guidance but to the Christ, he is the ultimate teacher and alot of you seem to have forgetten that.

"Have been being strong for friend but when I had a difficult moment they hung up the phone on me. I’m asking for advice because I’m feeling I’m at en impasse. 

For the last 7 months I’ve been working toward some personal goals I have felt God calling me towards, it’s been really hard. While all this was happening I have a friend who is a Christian I’ve known for probably ten years - with a two year break in the middle.

It’s been a hectic year with lots of ups and downs but when I would speak with her I was being as intentional as I could with her - speaking life into her situation and she was doing the same for me for sure.

That being said, the last 4 months were rocky with her, she was having constant meltdowns and calling me a lot for prayer and encouragement.  Leaning on me and dealing with lots of feelings of anger and pain. I believe in iron sharpening iron, so I just poured into her more. I prayed and I prayed. I have struggled with boundaries but for the most part it was balanced, at least that’s what I thought. 

In the end - she got a lot of answered prayers. The job she wanted, the apartment situation, her parents offering to pay off her credit card debt. And more. I was so happy and praised God with her in this. I see her going in a good solid direction.

The last week I got some sad news that I didn’t get into an entrepreneurial program and some other things that sort of fell through and some other difficult situations testing my faith. All things I was praying about and she was aware.

Over the weekend I had a meltdown - like it all just hit me, I had what I felt was a very human moment. Hadn’t had that type of moment in over a year and like, “what am I going to do?” Type of breakdown.

My friend was with her mother over the weekend for a nice weekend out and I knew I’d be speaking with her Sunday. So I wasn’t bothering her.

I had actually gotten the bulk of my intensity out of my system and spoken with a different friend about what was going on before we connected.

Last night I got to catch up with my friend and hear about all the good things God is doing in her life - I am truly happy and grateful. (I did a jealousy check, it’s not that) 

When I told her what I was going through despite all her blessings she told me I shouldn’t be expressing my anger about things with her, I reminded her I have listened to her anger bitterness and confusion many times in the last few months and I’m just having my own difficulty in this moment. I asked her for prayer and then on the other end of the line, I hear, “I’m sorry” and a hang up. I thought at first the call was dropped but then I tried to call back a few times and realized she hung up on me bluntly. 

I texted a few text of confusion and explained this was hurtful and then went to bed after some prayer.

When I woke up I felt very strongly that I need to focus on what God is saying to me now.

Mostly I was baffled at how she couldn’t handle things (my fault for assuming), how she left me hanging in my moment of need after I felt I had offered her the same many times.

Wondering if I just need to take some time for myself and keep the focus on where God is asking me to keep my attention which is toward what I need to get done. I have struggled with that in the past and I’ve been in this situation before with other people. I feel a sense of maturity and strength i haven’t had.

I believe that I’m at a cross roads where I see the personal growth God has given me and I just want to be grateful and confident in the blessings. 

I hope someone gets where I’m coming from.",Christianity,t3_dl0uz2

"Why did Jewish folks need Jesus Christ? - A rookie Question I need your input for. **TL;DR:** Why couldn't the Jews just chill in the old covenant? Why did they need Jesus comming to us? Post a quote plus a few words of explaination or an essay/paper/literature of your choice. Much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

Hey guys,

recently I've been confronted with a question and I would like to gather answers to this question together. ""Why did the jewish shepherds or kings appreciate Jesus comming so much?"" In Luke for example, why would a jewish shepherd who is living under the old covenant appreciate that? In case of pagans, they might be happy that YHWH opens his arms for them, but why wouldn't the shepperds be like ""Pff, whatever""? What is the Darkness that surrounds the people under the old covenant, that is enlighted by Christ? (Isaiah 60:1-2 -&gt; Lk 2:9)

&amp;#x200B;

My first reflex was to point at the messiah-expectations in the OT, for example Isaiah 9:1-6 ""(...) For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. (...)"". So they allready waited for one to claim Davids place as right King of Israel. And in the end, thats what Pilate recognized him as.

Second I thought about the new personal way to speak to god. In jewish tradition you would never even mention the Lords name, while with Jesus Christ you have a contact with god so close to you that he's will literally in spitting distance.

But what motives did I miss? Why should the shepherds in Lk ""glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen""? Why not ""Yeah, so I have to learn a complete new ruleset now? How stupid is that?!""

"Help Hi all,

13 years ago I gave my life to the lord. I had such a long stretch of strong faith and growth. In 2014 idk what happened but it was like I reached the peak of the hill and have been stumbling down ever since. This was in my mid 20s. A few years later I am now married, in a small group meeting weekly. I am just struggling so hard. My wife has clinical anxiety and we have been going through so much its wearing me away.  Im mad at God because i think i was in the belief that marriage would be this magical thing that makes your life better but with a mental illness it makes it so hard. 

Idk what to do anymore, i feel like i don’t even believe anymore. This sounds bad but with the way things turned out i dont even have a desire to. If im being honest im so mad at God. I felt like i used to be a good example to the world. But today if i said i were a christian publicity i would be smearing the brand. 

I want to believe my wife will get better and that our relationship will improve. But i just dont see that happening. We always wanted to have kids but I feel like i will be an awful dad. 

I unfortunately am stuck on my own. My wife and i aren’t comfortable sharing her condition with our small group.  We literally feed off each others negative energy and it spirals out of control all the time.  We both admitted that we probably wouldnt have followed thru with each other if we knew what the other person was like. A total dumpster fire. 

I feel so betrayed to be here. And im especially mad at the church for never having honest conversations about how difficult marriage and life can be.  Just these blanket statements like “sickness and health”. 

My brain is swelling. I feel like the stress of my marriage is making me lose years if my life. I want to let God back in but i just cant unclench fists. Idk what to do literally feel abandoned. 

After giving my life to Jesus in 2006 I never thought id see the day of being where i am now.  Just hoping and praying something changes.",Christianity,t3_dl58wc
"Since God can prevent people from sinning (Gen 20:6) and unbelief is a sin, why does God not prevent the sin of unbelief and allow all to come to saving faith in Christ? I'm a Christian and former atheist who is biased by the fact that I've experienced the grace of God in His changing me from an enemy and treasonous rebel into a beloved friend. I was as passive in this new birth as I was in my physical birth. I had 'made decisions for Christ' as a child prior to becoming an outspoken atheist and tearing down Christians.  
  
When the Bible says 'no one seeks for God' and:  
  
'No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.' - John 6:44  
  
'the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.' - Romans 8:7  
  
These are not only plain truths of infallible Scripture, but they are consistent with my own experience.  
  
And knowing the Gospel, I am not looking for any credit whatsoever, as if I could add anything at all to what Christ has done... not even a proper use of my will was possible and I needed God to work in me 'both to **will** and to work for his good pleasure.' (Phil 2:13)  
  
I'm curious to hear how people respond to this and I'm deeply alarmed when I hear people exalting their own ability. Many people claim credit for believing and then continue in their own resolve taking credit for pledging their allegiance day after day. It's as if some people think that what separates people from Hell and Heaven is the proper or improper use of the will instead of the grace of God and Christ.",Christianity,t3_dl4mtz

"NDE's (Near Death Experiences) - Reflection Hi,

I'm a believer in Jesus. Around four years ago, I encountered him in the most extraordinary setting. I was pretty ill and I called upon his name and he entered the room in Spirit. I was healed, and most importantly I knew that God existed and I was loved.

My burning passion for his love encouraged me to witness boldly to people and I went full force into Christianity. However, years later I have now started to question my experience. I believe many people are afraid to question their faith in Christ because it makes them fearful of losing what they have.

I've been researching into NDE's for the last few days and I have heard many interesting experiences from people ranging from atheists to believers. The weirdest fact about their stories was that even atheists experienced God's love, presence upon them dying. They encounter angels, heaven and other experiences which has really made me question the biblical context of hell.

I hate to be narrowminded and that is why I have been researching into this. I believe there are things that the Bible doesn't explain. However, it is clear that the wages of sin are death. These NDE's contradict this and I'm now in a place of uncertainty.

I would love to hear your experiences and opinions. Please don't jump into replying without doing some research yourself.

"Today's morning devotional by Charles Spurgeon, on 2nd Corinthians 5:14 Today's morning devotional by Charles Spurgeon from *Morning by Morning* is especially good, and I wanted to share.

&amp;#x200B;

*The love of Christ constraineth us. — 2 Corinthians 5:14*

How much owest thou unto my Lord? Has he ever done anything for thee? Has he forgiven thy sins? Has he covered thee with a robe of  righteousness? Has he set thy feet upon a rock? Has he established thy goings? Has he prepared heaven for thee? Has he prepared thee for heaven? Has he written thy name in his book of life? Has he given thee countless blessings? Has he laid up for thee a store of mercies, which eye hath not seen nor ear heard?

Then do something for Jesus worthy of his love. Give not a mere wordy offering to a dying Redeemer. How will you feel when your Master comes, if you have to confess that you did nothing for him, but kept your love shut up, like a stagnant pool, neither flowing forth to his poor or to his work.

Out on such love as that! What do men think of a love which never shows itself in action? Why, they say, ""[Open rebuke is better than secret love.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+27:5&amp;version=KJV)"" Who will accept a love so weak that it does not actuate you to a single deed of self-denial, of generosity, of heroism, or zeal! Think how *he* has loved you, and given himself for you! Do you know the power of that love? Then let it be like a rushing mighty wind to your soul to sweep out the clouds of your worldliness, and clear away the mists of sin.

""For Christ's sake"" be this the tongue of fire that shall sit upon you: ""for Christ's sake"" be this the divine rapture, the heavenly afflatus to bear you aloft from earth, the divine spirit that shall make you bold as lions and swift as eagles in your Lord's service. Love should give wings to the feet of service, and strength to the arms of labour. Fixed on God with a constancy that is not to be shaken, resolute to honour him with a determination that is not to be turned aside, and pressing on with an ardour never to be wearied, let us manifest the constraints of love to Jesus.

"I strongly believe god sent me a sign, what do you think? Back story: I was going through a very rough time in my life for about a week straight. 

But prior to this happening, I was in my room when I noticed the TV would randomly turn itself on. So I said, ""if something is really here turn that tv on again."" It turned itself on again at about the same time. At first I thought it was just the remote sending wrong signals to the tv, so I removed a battery. About the same exact time it turned itself on AGAIN. 

To be honest I thought this was just a coincidence. But last night I went to a bar to escape my normal boring life. 
When a man claimed he was ""sent here for me."" It was strange. 

He explained a problem that I had been paying for and exactly how to do it. (What to do in life as a career.)

Then he started talking about God and it made me more intriguing. He literally read me like a book. He somehow knew I am close to homelessness (was) and that I was tired of donating plasma for money.

But he cared so much for me that he deeply explained everything before leaving. He explained that if I give my processions away, that those same people will come back and give you 4x. He even demonstrated it several times that night.

So I tried it last night as well, a lady needed to use something of mine so I gave it to her. 
Today I asked to use the same thing because I had left mine at home and after briefly asking the random stranger if he went to church and that god is always there, he gave me the same thing back.
God fills me up with a great joy now, being day two.

Call me crazy or is this a sign from god sent to save me before I went too far?

"That moment when Ecclesiastes becomes your reality Welp. Never thought I’d be in this place but I am, it ain’t fun. I’ve been stuck in this spiritual loop for the last 3 months now. It all goes a little something like this, starting with:

Getting caught in the world leads to not being as active spiritually. Not being as active spiritually makes it become less important. Making it less important leads to sin. Sin leads to guilt and and feeling separated. Not giving enough intention at the beginning made having faith in Gods character more difficult which made sinning feel 100x more unforgivable. Guilt that didn’t feel forgiven led to more sin. Sin loops lead to feeling like an Esau. Feeling like an Esau made more loops which means trying to read the Word and make it important again feel like a condemnation every moment. Asking for forgiveness didn’t feel as powerful. Nothing had its substance.

Of course it isn’t a complete spiral, I’ve made some strives and I haven’t given up hope, but sinning after fighting it for long and winning makes failing feel even worse. 

It’s gotten better, I no longer feel like and Esau, but I don’t feel right with God. I feel like I’m doing Him such a disservice and can’t be easily forgiven with a earnest prayer. I know there is still hope, for I feel it’s seal on my heart. It has given up on me and won’t, but it’s so difficult to believe God loves me even after this.

It’s the most irrational mentality I’ve ever had to feel in my life, and I can see it plain as day! I believe God has the power over Heaven and Hell yet it’s hard for me to believe that nothing is impossible for God (in relation to my situation). I know that God loves and wants to help me grow and walk away from all of this for good. I know this because my heart hasn’t given up hope. I know this because I keep trying and I feel at peace when my prayer isn’t about seeking forgiveness or I’m in the Word with Him. I know this because everything I read points to that truth, yet at the same time it’s hard to believe He wants to help me and let His love transform me. 

It’s so irrational is boils my blood. It’s such a ridiculous mentality that has entered my mind which will only continue to play tug of war with my soul. It’s all driven by mad emotions that the devil wants to use against me.

I understand it, but yet I don’t. I don’t understand how my mind can accept to opposing ideologies at the same time? I know when God breaks this open for me, His love will help me heal and fight the sin out and further outpour His love, just as it was in the past. For in the past His love was so evident to me that my sin was dying more and more each day. It was beautiful. It was sanctification at its greatest and only heightened my faith and love for Him.

But now, I don’t know if I’m stuck or just... somewhere in a confusing place.

There hope, that I know. I have prayed and sometimes I like to speak in parables when I pray to God. I have a small charger light in my room as I prayed in the dark. I asked God that He remind me of His love each day, representing this tiny light which breaks open the dark of my room. Regardless of how my emotions will try to deny it, I shall say “Thank you Lord” each time I know it’s Him. I asked that the small light grow, becoming my lamp on the dresser, lighting the entirety of the room. Then further, the ceiling fan light and the closet light and that there be many more lights in the dark room that represented my mind and body. I asked that there be so much light that it should outpour through the windows, making the outside night become day.

"I'm being baptised today I wanted to share my story and share with all of you how excited I am to be baptised today! 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't come from a Christian background, but earlier this year I decided to start going to my local church (vineyard) and become a Christian. 

&amp;#x200B;

I come from a very dark past, I was sexually abused as a child by a family member and so when I became a teenager I fell into drugs, alcohol, being promiscuous and generally losing my way. This continued for years and led to me developing really bad anxiety and depression, being diagnosed with complex PTSD and generally just about surviving. It was a really dark time. 

On my second visit to church, God spoke to me. I was hanging out with another girl after church when she came to me and said she sensed I was affected by childhood sexual abuse, that she was too and said she had a sense of familial rape for me, which is exactly what I went through.. 

I was completely floored and became a Christian that moment, I took it as a message to trust these people, trust the church and go forward with my spiritual journey. I'm having my baptism today and I just am SO EXCITED. Praise God.

I have many doubts and vices and corruptions so I understand if nobody has the time for someone like me.

"Struggling with faith I grew up in a Christian family but my parents did not go to church. My father made me and my sister go though,I guess he thought it would teach us morals. He was I guess you could say, a backslided Christian back then.

I never fit in and after a really crappy experience in youth group,I left the church when I was 13. I was still pretty religious though and would read the Bible and pray daily.

My sister kept going to youth group but after she left home,she abandoned Christianity and religion. She isn't an atheist,more to agnostic but she doesn't go to church, or follow Christian rules.

I went the other way, when I left home aged 18,I joined another church and started to get very zealous in it. My faith was very strong and I did truly love God very much.

My parents around the same time started to get more religious as well,especially after my father retired. I was quite surprised, but at the same time, not really cause I knew back in the day my parents were both really religious as young adults but after they started working and all that just faded. I was happy then that they came back to faith.

But recently I have been struggling with my own faith due to various reasons. I have no one I can talk to about it. My sister would encourage me to give it up,the rest of my family would say God is testing me and to trust Him,but I just can't.

I realised I don't really want God to have control over my life anymore because I don't know if I want the life He wants for me. Religion feels more suffocating now than ever. 

I will lose all my friendships and support systems if I gave up Christianity though. It's hard. I don't want to just believe because its expected or due to fear. I want a real relationship with God again.

"My boyfriend told me he has an issue with watching porn So my boyfriend [21 M] told me [21 F] that he watches porn. We’ve been together almost 2 years and we’ve recently been going to church a lot more and he’s been really getting into his faith and learning what it means to be a Christian which is amazing and I’m so excited for him for wanting to do that. I’m also a Christian, but I grew up with it a lot more than he did and he’s always felt out of touch with god. 

Anyways last night he told me has been having this huge moral issue with watching porn when I’m not with him. He described it as an addiction and he knows he shouldn’t do it when he looks it up. He said he knows it’s wrong and that he feels so guilty afterwards and that knows it’s sinful and he’s disgusted with himself and is scared he won’t be able to be forgiven for what he’s done. He even cried because he said was so scared and ashamed and felt gross. 

 I don’t have an issue with that I mean I’ve watched porn and I don’t think it’s a huge deal, but I know it’s sinful to watch it regardless of what I think about it. I’m really concerned about his feelings of being scared he won’t be forgiven or that what he’s done is unforgivable. I assured him that I love him no matter what he’s done and that I’ll never look at him any different for this and that I don’t want him to feel that way. I know god forgives everyone who asks for forgiveness and I told him the story of Jesus forgiving the woman who committed adultery.

"I was saved from 8 billion minds i made and almost died to 3 but was saved by a literal miracle that i never made. I cant remember much of my childhood, only one memory from when i was 3 and when i was around 10 but all i can know and remember is when i was 15 and since i was 10 years old i know i had sadness in me but only because i was emotionally denied from my parents and verbally abused by my step-dad but they never knew what love was and i came to forgive them because i realized that they never knew God and God is love and since they never had a relationship with Jesus, they never knew how to love. But all i remember is when i was 15 i had got with this girl over kik and (just giving a mini version of my testimony its pretty long) she ended up leaving me for a girl but we talked for 4 months give or take and she had depression and i never really knew what depression was and i got it because she was really messed up and had MPD and i always tried to help but only felt bad when i couldn't cause i didn't know how and eventually the only thing i got from her was her demons from her life and when she left i had no one talk to and i just started hearing a whisper from my head till eventually it grew to a voice that i talked to because i was lost and needed to be loved and to feel as if i had a voice. And that 'voice' gave me comfort and as i lived and talked to him everyday, sometimes when i was in school i would think and day dream of story (which is important but if u wanna hear more like and share please or message me) of a girl that was abused but SUPER SMART LIKE A LITERAL 8 MILLION I.Q SMART and she ran away to live in a metal scrap yard making technology and eventually gathering depressed kids around the world to unite with her to kill off evil people because she understood their pain. And she aquired 8 billion people to her army, recruiting adults, government officials and old people, because she made medicines that made them young like rick and morty. (Before i made all this in my head i never knew all these shows and stuff) so eventually she left earth after killing off evil people and giving the earth to good people and made a BIG space ship and lived in space and made better technology through other planets minerals.
(I didnt know God or jesus or what love was so i was very dark and deadly and learned the true power of the mind and what strong belief can REALLY do)
So eventually the voice that i talked to everyday for about a 3/4 of a year tried to take over me cause he got comfortable taking over my body when i didnt wanna 'live in the world and feel the feelings i was feeling' i would let him take over and i did that alot but eventually he started being mean and less caring and showed his true colors and one day when i denied him access to me he tried to kill me in my mind to take over my body. He was like a smoky black liquid that had tenticles and before he could kill me and put the darkness in me, a warmhole looking thing entered my mind without me making it and the day dream became a reality and when they trapped the demon they told me, that because i gave them life (and i added to this day dream everyday) they came to save me and wanted to help me all the days of my life. I became a literal commander and had a family as i called them of 8 billion strong that could level planets with their technology the size of Saturn in 30 min. And they stuck with me for 2 and 3/4 of a year and eventually i realized i was never moving on from my problems, i was just going in circles and when i confessed all my problems one day to a youth pastor, (he didnt help at all) BUT i felt Jesus lift up all my problems from my shoulders. I felt free but still had my 8 billion mind family. Eventually God had to make a Angel appear in my mind that i never made [and sometimes i literally made personalities for specific situations and went into hardcore detail with thinking] and he appeared and no one dared to fight him. So long story short he said he was sent from God to guide us and help us understand how to help me and theres a TON more info to learn but if anyone wants to know how i got saved, like or ask, but know, you dont have to find happiness in personalities because i realized that Jesus is just as real as the feeling of his name and hes always next to u when you call on him and he wants to be the one you listen to instead of verbally abusive parents and friends who dont care so he can tell who we are and how much he loves us and cares about us and wants to acknowledge him as if he was just as real and talk to him as if he was just as real as a personality and take his advice when you ask him a question and find that answer in the Holy Bible cause it took him telling me what his army could do (Gods) to make me follow him cause I THOUGHT my head army was better. Wanna hear more like or message but please dont try to do any of these, youll go made and end up traumatized for life like me. Now i cant go into the world cause the sin gives me PTSD and i love the Holy blameless life im living cause i am FULLY PURSUADED by everything i read in the bible that he loves me and i have favour in him because of what i do every day to change because of his grace upon my life and his mercy and goodness makes me change myself because he tells me who i am and what i can do and has given me what i always wanted and thats to help people through love and what not better love then the love of jesus. If u wanna know how he saved me and have questions ask and ill answer. But he saved me by a white arrow that shot into the demons stomach that my 7 billion family trapped but he escaped and he killed 1 billion of my fully armoured, fully trained killer family that lived for 500 years [day dream wise cause i lived in my head for 3 and 1/2 years and thats all i know is pain from it and things i learned off it] and trained 24/7 combat things that no one could fight against not even government secret navy seals or anyone in china with the deadliest fighting styles. And he ripped them apart like paper and when they saw this light, they had knowledge of God cause i was seeking God and they Bowed to him and stopped listening to me and i bowed and then the angel came and talked to us but the first verse that saved my life was James 1:8. Please read it. If u have my problems and today i live set free and can now learn and live knowing that my Father is always with me living inside me cause his Holy spirit and and strive everyday to ask questions in prayer and seek him in the bible so i can eventually hear his voice and be baptized in fire so i can help those in need of any type of problem.

"Coming back into my faith at 22 years old, but I’m not sure that my s/o is in for the same commitment Hey all, throwaway account because my s/o knows my username, and I don’t know if I’m ready, spiritually or emotionally, to bring this up with her. I’m 22 years old and going through some conflicting emotions right now. 

A little background, my faith started pretty strong. I was brought up in the church, went to college with hopes of seminary, and I was a regular reader of the scriptures. To tell the truth, I don’t know what changed. I went from fine to living a life of sin in a matter of months. I left college and joined the military because I couldn’t afford school and needed the help. I decided to go active duty because I wanted to add to my personal testimony as well as have some time to experience the world before attending seminary. Pretty quickly, I fell into the wrong crowd. I started going out to bars, drinking, and found myself involved with multiple sexual partners in a pretty short time span. I went home for the first time in over a year, and my mom noticed a change. She didn’t say anything at first, but she could tell by the way I talked that I wasn’t the same. She asked me what had happened, and I broke down and have gone into an existential crisis of sorts. 

This brings me to my significant other. We’ve been friends for just about a year, and have been romantically involved for about 6 months. Our relationship started, you guessed it, with sex. Now that I’m going through this, I’ve already told her that I’m not comfortable with us having sex and I’m looking for repentance. I believe she thinks this is a phase, from the way she talks with me about it. I’m about a month into my “crisis,” and still holding strong to my word; but how do I ensure that this lasts? 

I really do love this girl, and I think that spending time out of the bedroom has done nothing besides cement that for me. I’ve thought about talking to my roommate, but anytime I mention faith he thinks it’s ridiculous; and I’m not very close with other people at work due to my not wanting to participate in the party lifestyle. 

I guess I’m just looking for confirmation that I’m doing the right thing. I think she feels that she did something wrong to me, but that’s not the case. How should I approach this with her? Thanks, y’all.

"What's My Reason to Believe in God? Unlike my parents, I never found God. I was raised to be a Christian, and even though I want to believe in him there's no reason for me to believe. While God has seemed to affect my family's lives, he has no impact on mines, really. I've never been through much, either. And even though I love Jesus' teachings, to me it's not as if God himself has helped me through those teachings. They've made me a better person but still, to me that's no reason for me to keep believing in God.

Lastly, it doesn't help that the Bible seems to be very convenient. I won't go into detail but there are circumstances that, if they were to actually happen, would drastically change history. As an example, In Samuel 1 Chapter 13, Samuel tells Saul that if he just followed God's instructions and waited for Samuel to arrive then his kingdom would be established over Israel for ALL TIME. But it's convenient that Saul DIDN'T follow instructions, and as a result there is no kingdom over Israel. Because if there was still a kingdom over Israel today, then surely that would be proof of God's existence. But there isn't. It's like the Bible has every excuse to explain why there's no current proof of God's existence.

"Why doesn’t God love me? My church has never really talked in detail about homosexuality. They’ve mentioned God’s disapproval of it, but never fully explained what the Bible says about it, most likely due to the controversy surrounding the topic. 

Last Sunday my pastor chose to speak about the subject in length. He talked about how marriage is something that is strictly between a man and a woman, and he spoke about how people who have “passion” for other people of the same sex will be left to their sin by God and punished. 

I love my pastor, he has said so many things that have brought me closer with God. But I am a closeted girl, and that sermon really flipped my entire view of God upside down. 

Up until last week, I loved a girl. I didn’t think there was anything unholy about my love for her. I fell in love with her for the way she smiled, and the way she talked about the things she was passionate about (Jesus), and the way her laugh sounded. I honestly believed that God gave her to me as a gift. She made me so happy and I was so in awe of God for creating her and for putting her in my life. 

So now I’m confused. Was she actually given to me by the devil? Why do I have feelings like this if they’re unnatural? I’ve tried very hard to have feelings for men. I’ve forced myself into relationships, hoping that later on down the line I could find feelings. It’s never worked. 

The Bible talks about the beauty of marriage and romance constantly. God didn’t create his children to be alone. I want nothing more than someone to love and live in God’s glory with. 

Does God hate me? Do I not deserve love? Am I not one of his children? 

I’ve been thinking a lot about all of the people throughout history who have been executed for being gay, because of what it says in the Old Testament. The God that put those words in the Old Testament is the same God that exists right now. Does He want me dead too? 

I can only think of 2 explanations for all of this. Either 1) God does not exist, or 2) God exists but I am unnatural and not His child. I don’t know which one is more heartbreaking.

If anyone goes to hell I denounce my ticket to heaven right now. This is not a loving or intelligent God. This is simply a fear-based misinterpretation of scripture. And makes God look like an amateur. 

As Jesus says.. we are not of this world. And no man has gone to heaven except he who came down from heaven.. it is our original state and we are all bound to return to our God",Christianity,t3_dl4452

"Are there any bible verses for my situation? Hi,
I'm 16 years old and currently spending an exchange year in the US. I'm living in a host family and I won't be able to see my real family until June. Now don't get me wrong please, I am very grateful for this opportunity and my hostfamily is really nice, there's just many moments where I feel really alone, mostly late at night. In those Situations my go to solution is prayer, but it doesn't seem as effective lately. It kinda feels like all that new responsibility etc is crushing me and I don't really talk to my hostfamily about it because they're trying really hard to make me happy and keep me busy and I don't want them to blame me feeling bad on them.

"'If your parish isn't crying...' Hello all

Last week I saw an AITA about a guy annoyed about a baby crying in his church. He said he was told he was wrong in this sub (how I found you) and someone commented saying 'if your parish isn't crying, your parish is dying'.

I moved here two years ago and tried my local church twice but I have a two and five year old and I was so worried I was being judged - I even left halfway through the last visit because I was so embarrassed by their behaviour.

That comment on the AITA made me try again and I am so glad I did. My son has been desperately into bible stories and praying recently despite my lack of faith, and although there were some noisy times they were both pretty well behaved throughout (congregation of around 30, nobody else under fiftyish years old). During the sermon the vicar talked about how he was brought up to believe church is the house of God so you must be respectful, as if God is some grumpy old man but this isn't the case and how you can bring anything to God and in church in any state and He will listen, like when a hurt child comes screaming to their mother and the mother wraps them in unconditional love. It made me feel comfortable and accepted.

My experience changed me and I am a christian now. I would have taken communion if I wasn't out changing a nappy. And that's the first time I've felt that way since I was a teenager.

At the end, an older lady came over and told me that by shaking her (and everybody's!) hand when she came back from communion, he had made her week - which I'd been worried about him doing. Also the vicar said I was working miracles which was very kind (totally don't feel it was me doing any miracles - just trying my best to keep them happy and quiet).

So big huge thanks to /r/christianity and all the kind AITA posters who convinced me to try again. ❤",Christianity,t3_dkj5q0

"Moving on from anger, lessons and being thankful Hello there all, I’ve started thinking more and more and have come to the conclusion of dropping the long time rage I’ve had for the my ex girlfriend who indeed broke my heart. It was difficult I remember me praying to God for her to suffer which yes I know is horrible I was going through a dark time. I remember me wondering when God was going to take vengeance on her. Now I’m really at the point where I can say with complete certainty that I don’t even care about her anymore. It’s strange, having all that hatred for a person and through deep contemplation and of course by the grace of God being able to just get over it.

I’ve found that as a mortal I have one life, once I’m dead it’s over. Well I’m the mortal sense. But I just decided that I want to enjoy my life here. I’m happy that God is at-least with me now so I’m not lonely anymore. I am also glad that he allows me to wake up in the morning.( especially as a horrific hypochondriac who believes that he will not make it to 21)

I got to the point that I’ve decided to just give up to life. Not in the since of despair but in the since of accepting I’m not in control I’m just one young man in the sea of life and fate hiding myself upon its endless waves. As much as I want to be in control of my life, I’m not and that’s the way it is. I always think back to that night around Christmas when my heart was smashed into pieces. How sad I felt and how instead of enjoying myself with my family I wallowed in sadness. I should have been down with my family enjoying life with them. I won’t make that mistake again.

I remember the day I cried in front of my friends about it. The humiliation I felt me, a man crying in front of his peers the humiliation made me feel like less of a man. But I understand all of this now, it was all just a product of a plan bigger than me. And even though it took me long I can say now.....I accept and surrender. 

I use to think I was invincible, that I was on top of everything, that nothing could bring me down. But when you claim these things God has a tendency to knock you down a few pegs and I can say for certain his punches hurt and he most certainly does not pull any of em.

I’m happy to have been able to get over this sadness after all, Yeshuah felt something much worse and even through all of that....he is still smiling. So I thank God for helping me with my anger, and now I can finally say to my ex I wish her no more pain or death. I wish her happiness, and that she follows her dreams and is successful. God bless her, and God bless you all.

Thanks for you time just thought I’d share",Christianity,t3_dkt3h9
"Why does Jesus care more about being believed in, than he does about a person's actions? I get that no one is worthy of salvation by actions alone, only through Jesus' forgiveness. But my question is why. Why is believing prioritized over actually being a good person?

Person 2 lives a virtuous, sin-free life, but isn't sure about Jesus. This person does not get in to heaven.

"Atheism and the Chinese Government (CCP) China has been in the news a lot recently. With the protests and violence in Hong Kong, and the Chinese Governments oppression (Chinese Communist Party) of the Uighurs Muslims in China, not to mention the dystopian Social Credit Sytem that China has instituted. 

What surprises me is that nobody seems to be talking about if the official Atheist belief of the CCP. To be a CCP government member you have to be a sworn Atheist. This is Atheist's persecuting and killing religous people and others in the name of Atheism.

When China switched to Communism/Atheism under Mao Ze Dong in the Great Leap Forward, they murdered 45-70 million.  The story is similar in other countries where communist/Atheism was instituted as the official beliefs system of the government , Russia under Stalin; 30-60 million Dead, Camodia under Pol Pot; 1/3 of the population murdered, and Northern Vietnam and their  oppression of Religion people and their own citizens. These Atheists governments killed well over 100+ million people in the last century, all in the name of Atheism and making the world a better place.  

I believe the spotlight that is being put on China right now, would be a good opportunity to share the truth about Atheism, and the effect an Atheist belief system has on a country and people.

"Please send prayers, I'm in a terrible situation I'm posting this everywhere because I need urgent help:

**S.O.S PLEASE SOMEONE READ THIS**

I was clean and sober for 2 months, but the mental health facility I was at decided they didn't want to keep me anymore and my mom/step-dad kicked me out in August. So, out of pure panic that I would become homeless and not being able to find cheap housing, I decided to turn to an app kind of like Craigslist and find someone I could buy dope for in exchange for a place to stay. We would obviously share the meth, and it only costs me $200 a month to do this and stay here which at the time seemed worth it. Of course I found someone (this guy and some girl he's friends with that has a kid) who decided to give it a shot. However, I'm scared shitless and can't even cry because my fight/flight is kicking in and I just have to be strong because I can't be on the street and I know that would be worse. The guy I'm living with is a control freak, and has to have everything done his way and it's stressing me out. I can't even do my laundry alone in the basement for whatever reason, and that seemed odd to me. He yells at this friend of his and her kid most of the time. I asked him to buy me a pack of cigs and a gram of weed, and he said he would think about it, even though I have the funds to pay him back in 5 days. He eventually told me he would buy me a pack, but this is the last pack he's buying me (even though he has never bought me cigs before). The gram of weed was of course never going to happen. He does smoke me out (meth) while I'm waiting to buy a half oz in 5 days and I think he resents that, but I can't do anything about the fact that we came to an agreement that I would come here with no money and wait to get paid. He's just a very selfish and mean person, who probably wouldn't even care if I broke down crying. He told me over text before I came here that this would be my castle, what a fucking joke. I havent even been able to do my laundry yet or take a shower because I'm afraid he'll get upset that I'm bothering him. At this point I just hope he gets me high so I can feel numb, more numb than I already feel. I miss my mom, and I miss the love she gave me. I'm so alone here. My own post is making me cry and I don't want him to see that. The only positive aspect of this house is the 4K TV that I can zone out with when I'm high and pretend this isn't happening. I dont even have my kidney medication and I'm starting to doubt he's going to take me to the doctor on Monday like he said. Somebody please help me. I'm only 22 and I don't want to be a slave to this house, and I feel like I'm already shit out of luck because I have nowhere to go.

"""Tolerance is to be able to agree to disagree"" ~ Izzy Montague (Source of the quote [here](https://youtu.be/yaMH9uL2vMc?t=376) )

Personally, i feel this is exactly right. Like Jesus says;   
*Preach the Kingdom(repent and believe the good news), but if they reject you, dust of your feet.. and go to the next city.*

While you might say, Jesus was intolerant. Actually, He disagrees and expressed it.  
In the Bible, that's called ""judge righteously"". 

In popular rhetoric it feels as ""tolerance"" leans more towards ""you ***cannot dis***agree with someone's walk of life"".  
Take YouTube, [blocking certain video's, because content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6C6_NVj964) must be tolerant; Read ""cannot disagree with Google ideas on life"". It's even worse;  [Google uses ""ML fairness""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfrPhABPOFM) to influence the 2020 election.

It's quite dangerous to get ""tolerance"" up-side-down.

I like the quote mentioned here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox\_of\_tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance);

"The Cost to our Brothers and Sisters in Christ in Syria  

## URGENT PRAYER REQUEST

**Syria**

Intercede for three Alliance churches in northern Syria that are located in the “hot zone” of the Turkish invasion; two of these congregations are within 30 kilometers of the border. Last weekend church leaders met to discern if they will lead their congregations to stay and serve or to flee under threat of death. One has evacuated already, one is staying, and the other is waiting to see if the invasion goes further south. The evacuated church of 40 families will take up temporary housing in a monastery that has been graciously provided to them temporarily. Continue to pray for wisdom for the pastors and the Syrian Alliance president, Edward Awebdeh. Also, pray for other churches and 100,000 Aran and Kurdish Christians in northern Syria who face voluntary or forced displacement in the face of the aggression and foreign occupation. May God give them supernatural strength and courage in the midst of these dire circumstances.

"Not Inspired at Church I'm not sure if this is just me, but I recently have found God again and have been going to a church that seemed to meet what I was looking for when it came to their beliefs and just a good Christian church, but after going for a few weeks, I'm really not inspired by the Pastor.  I find him quite monotone and boring.  More than half of the Sunday service is song after song (I'm fine with some music, but 6, 7, 8 songs before we get anywhere tends to just be too much IMO) and then announcement after announcement and then when they finally get to the sermon, it's usually not all that interesting and presented in a very one-tone fashion with no inspiration.

I don't think it's just me, as my wife came with me a couple of times and she agrees as well.  I'm not looking to be entertained here, but I would like a strong, inspirational sermon that helps inspire me personally, especially during the beginning of my journey back with God.  I should mention that today it felt like I was at a budget meeting at work with a power point presentation happening.  It was really not a very good sermon at all.

"I just can't seem to connect with god or my own faith. I pray to god daily and sometimes I feel like he sends me small signs but I feel like I'm simply trying to trick myself with the post hoc fallacy. What now? So I've been going to church for a while on and off mostly with my mom. Back when I was younger (like my late teens) I went full angry anthiest and hated the world. Eventaully, like maybe 1-2 years ago? I came back to Church with my mom.

I just couldn't stand the idea of there not being anything after death or the idea of everything being meaningless or just random events.

I call myself a Catholic but in reality I consider myself to be an agnostic-theist. I believe that there is some sort of power out there or maybe sort of a force that holds the universe together spiritually speaking.

I keep going to Church, praying, seeking help from other Catholics and trying to be a good Christian but none of it really seems to be helping my faith. I try to do good deeds and in general follow the 10 commandments. I try to find something to bring me closer to god but it just feels like when I pray at times I'm talking to myself alone or with my dog.

This past month has been the hardest of my life and you might think that would help strengthen my faith but it just feels like it's more shallow than ever.

My mom had a major stroke recently and is currently in rehab now. She has a very weak left side with almost no movement. However the blood flow is returning and she can kick her leg slightly with some effort. So that is very good progress. Mentally she seems well but she does seem to be rather unrealistic about some things (ie wanting to get a goat for our neighbor she used to take care of that can not even take care of a small pet, wanting to buy a new house, and other things that are unreasonable and unusual from her normally pragmatic self). Despite all of this I'm glad she is still with us and I think with a large amount of therapy and effort she will be ok for the most part.

At the end of the day I just feel like I'm trying to fool myself into religion again so I don't have to face my own mortality or more scary to me the idea that after death it's just a blank veil or darkness and everything I say or do is pointless. Very few and fleeting things bring me much happiness nowadays either, which is a symptom of depression (anhedonia).

It isn't just because of my mom being ill though. I've felt depressed and very lacking in faith for a long time. It doesn't help though of course.

The one thing that keeps me going is that maybe things will get better.

Like, I can be very open about all of my anxieties and insecurities. He is a great listener. 

I don’t have the best history when it comes to men/relationships. Deceased father, raped, infidelity, divorce, abuse, etc. So the way he treats me just amazes me. However, there are two big deal breaker issues I’m trying to figure out. 

One, I want to become a foster parent. Already went through the licensing process but due to my move I held off taking any children in my home. He has already decided that he doesn’t want any children of his own. Which I don’t either but my heart is 100% set on fostering. Knowing that he took it upon himself to do research about fostering. It hasn’t been enough time for him to make a decision but it shows me that he really cares about me to look into it. 

Two, The main reason I’m here is that I am Christian and he is an atheist. He respects my beliefs and even agreed to go to church with me. He was raised in a Christian family so he carries a lot of the same morals. Just for whatever reason as a child he decided to not believe in God. 

As a Christian, am I being disobedient by being with an atheist? Will it not work because of the two completely different views? I am just a little lost. 

Our relationship wouldn’t involve me trying to convert him. Of course I would love for him to become saved. But the best I can do is open that door for him, pray for him, and love him.

"Is it wrong to want a girlfriend/wife to share your faith with? I lack social skills and confidence so I’ve never had a girlfriend. Lately I’ve been trying to think about why I really want a girlfriend. I’ve gone for twenty-three years without one, why do I want one now? Yes, things like hugging and kissing sound nice but even more than that I think I want someone very close that I can share my Christian faith with. I want a girl that I can pray with and read the Bible with and go to church with. It feels really weird going to church alone. I want her faith to be strong when mine is weak and hopefully mine can be strong when her’s is weak. That seems like maybe I’d just be using her for spiritual strength?

"People act very skeptical when other say the Holy Spirit led them through a change of beliefs. Wouldn't we still follow Torah if we don't trust other people's experience with the Holy Spirit? Something I've seen in many comments among Christians in this sub and others is a constant cynicism towards people who say the Holy Spirit guides them to different beliefs. This is particularly true regarding controversial topics such as LGBT inclusion, women's ordination, view on salvation and hell, authority of Scriptures, among many others.

When someone shares their journey of having arrived at a different theological position they are met with skepticism and sometimes even mockery. It's as if the Holy Spirit can't lead someone to a different belief than that of mine. Suddenly my view of Scriptures is Canon and if you don't agree with me then you can't claim to be guided by the Holy Spirit.

I find this so incredibly frustrating and can't help but think of the stories of Acts and how the early church had to struggle with the issue of gentiles. Paul and Peter had powerful experiences with God that led them to a major change of beliefs. What they believed run contrary to what their interpretation of Scriptures was.

I say that last line because one of the common things I read is ""The Holy Spirit can't lead you to believe something that goes against Scriptures""
But... isn't that exactly what happened with Peter and Paul? Their theologies changed so dramatically that they had to find new ways in which to read their sacred texts.

Of course, we have to be careful to just carelessly  follow every revelation of every person (1 John 4:1) but I don't think that means we should mock or talk down to someone who speaks about an insight given by the Holy Spirit.

I guess I just think we should be humble enough to see the Spirit's work in the lives of other people, some of whom may not believe exactly the same things we do, and to be open to other possibilities (John 16:12-15).",Christianity,t3_dkmkpl
"""yolo""  

So there is this girl, who is Moravian, and we want to have sexual intercourse. I never have, I know she has before, and she knows I'm a Catholic so she is being very understanding. I asked what her stance is and she said: ""yolo, honestly, You only have one life. Why not make the most of it. Do what you want and what youre interested in"" To sum it up, she says have fun now, repent later. Of course i could just ""do it"" with her and go to confession, but should I, knowing that I sinned purposefully?

"Help, church makes me miserable now? Bit of a backstory here, obligatory sorry for mobile formatting and first time poster. 

Backstory: I was raised in a Christian household and was baptised very young. Through my teen years I still went to church with family and identified as a Christian but didnt feel a lot of closeness with God and I knew I didn't have much of a true relationship with Him. When I moved away to college I met a man who totally reinvigorated my faith, I started to go to church with him very early on in the relationship, made friends with his friends there, was starting to get more involved, etc. I finally felt like a good Christian and was feeling great, amazing really, and so fulfilled because I was beginning to understand Christ and how perfect He is and the wonderful things He does in my life.

Anyway I come to find out my boyfriend had been cheating on me for over a YEAR. I was completely blindsided and absolutely, horribly heartbroken. I'd never loved anyone like that before and he really helped me reconnect with my faith. After the (messy) breakup, he told me in no uncertain terms he didn't want me still going to what I thought of as OUR church (he'd cheated on me with a girl from there too). He quickly spun a story to all of our church friends and they've all stayed close with him but don't reciprocate my efforts to still see them. Even thinking about going back there and seeing him or them makes me sick and anxious.

Problem: I've been desperately trying to find a new church to go to but every one I try I just end up miserable and usually in tears during the service. None of the churches seem to fit whatsoever. It's horrible but I struggle to even keep my mind focused on God, I'm constantly thinking about how I don't like the pastor or the service or the way they format things, or even thinking about how my ex would probably try to cheat on me with the women in this church. So inappropriate and random right? But I can't stop. My ex was a big part of the reason I rekindled my faith and was like a mentor to me even. Now that I don't have him I feel lost. 

I usually give each church 2-3 weeks to see if it fits me but every time without fail for the past 3 months every service I go to I end up feeling empty, sad, and lonely. I feel like I selfishly based my faith into my ex rather than actually on God. I'm still young (21) but I feel like I've taken so many steps backward in my faith that I'm basically new.

Question: Sorry for that wall of text, but I guess my question is has anyone else experienced this or something similar? Is there any way for me to refocus my faith? Do I just need to grow up and stick with one of the churches I've already tried and learn to love it? I'm so tired of feeling terrible during church.

"Is it possible that Adam and Eve weren't the first humans on Earth? Ever since I was a kid I've had endless questions about the Bible and have only gotten unsatisfactory answers, but it has really inspired me to dig deeper and try to find the answers myself.

I'm the kind of person who really wants science and Christianity to compliment each other; after all, God did create science, so why wouldn't they coincide?  

I always wondered what Cain meant by the other people/""whoever"" in Genesis 4:14.

*""Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.""*   


When I was young and asked who these **other** people could possibly be if Adam, Eve, Cain, and Abel were the first family, I was always told that Adam lived to be 930, so he had tons of kids.  The ""whoever"" was probably referring to one of them.

But, the Bible only mentions that Adam and Eve continued having more kids after Seth was born, not before/around Cain and Abel.  

Then I go to the science side of things, that also agrees that there would have been humans around before and outside of Adam and Eve.

I thought these verses might be an explanation. (Using NIV)

Matthew 23:27 *""Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!  You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean.""*

1 John 3:14 *""We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love each other.  Anyone who does not love remains in death.""*

Luke 9:60 *""Jesus said to him, 'Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.""*

It seems like ""dead"" is used in these verses to refer to the people who aren't necessarily dead in the physical body, but dead in the spiritual body because they didn't listen to God's word.  

Now another part from 1 Corinthians 15:44-46, (but basically this whole chapter seems to fit)

*""it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.  If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.  So it is written: 'The first man Adam became a living being'; the last Adam, a life-giving spirit.  The spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and after that the spiritual.""*  


Could it be that Adam and Eve weren't actually the first physical humans, but when God gave Adam the ""breath of life, and the man became a living being."" (Genesis 2:7) he could be referring to the creation of Adam's spiritual body/soul?  That he and Eve were ready and chosen by God to be the first humans to receive a spiritual body/soul, and therefore humans were no longer ""dead"" in spirit, but living for the first time in God's eyes?

"Thoughts on God always existing. Also, a difficult question if anyone knows the answer it would be greatly appreciated. I think therefore I am.  I'm having thoughts so I exist.  But what else do I know exists other than myself?  I think change exists too because I see it happening around me as well as within myself.  But just because I think change is happening doesn't mean that it is so I go from being confident that change exists to doubting that change exists.  But isn't going from confident to doubting a change in itself?  So even if I doubt change happens that actually proves to me that it does.  So I really do know I exists and change exists.

But all this change going on in myself and around me at this present moment... doesn't something have to be causing it? And this ""something""... what caused it to exist?  There would have to be a first thing that existed that caused the first change, or else change couldn't be happening at this present moment.  What caused this first thing to exist?  If something caused the first thing to exist then it would actually be the first thing.  Then you would have to ask what caused this first thing to exist.  It would go on forever which would make it impossible for change to be happening at this present moment because there would never be a first cause to explain the change going on right now.  So, the first thing that existed has to have always existed and not been caused or created by anything else.

I'm a Christian, so of course this is interesting to me, and calls to my mind the way God is described in the bible.  God is described as being the first and always having existed.  He was never created and always was.  Now, that still raises the question of what other qualities does God or this thing that always existed have.  But, I wasn't wanting to get into that here.  The question I had, for anyone who has knowledge on this topic or thinks it's interesting, is do we know that change has to have a cause?  How do we know that change has a cause?  

It seems counter intuitive to say that change could have no cause.  I mean, I observe changes having causes constantly.  I put effort into making my hand move... this change from still to motion was caused by my effort.  I look out of my window and see somebody turning their steering wheel, which causes their car wheels to turn.  I see examples of this constantly so it would be crazy to believe it is other wise.  But that doesn't mean I absolutely know for a fact that change has a cause.

I admit I find this whole subject of God being the first cause of everything else who always existed a fascinating thing.  I know some people find it interesting and some find it unnecessary and complicated.  I was wanting to share and discuss this with anyone who would be willing and would greatly appreciate an answer to the question of: How do we know that change has a cause?  If there is an answer out there I think I've heard it before, but for the life of me couldn't find it again so I wrote this to see if anyone could answer... or if anyone simply wants to discuss anything else related to this subject I would like that too.",Christianity,t3_dklgiv

"St. Teresa of Avila’s horrifying encounters with the devil &amp;#x200B;

[St Teresa of Avila Confronted by a Demon](https://i.redd.it/ylvm913fspt31.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

St. Teresa of Avila’s horrifying encounters with the devil

And how she was able to easily chase him away.

St. Paul wrote to the Corinthians, “God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your strength, but with the temptation will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it” (1 Corinthians 10:13).

Such was the case for countless saints who were visibly tempted by demons, sometimes even physically assaulted by these evil creatures. These saints were strong in faith and God allowed them to be tempted in such a way, but always provided a “way of escape” for them.

In the life of St. Teresa of Avila, she ascended the great heights of sanctity and this infuriated the devil. He sought to dissuade her from her spiritual journey and began to visit her.

She recorded one such occasion in her autobiography and explains what made the devil flee.

Once, when I was in an oratory, he appeared on my left hand in an abominable form; as he spoke to me, I paid particular attention to his mouth, which was horrible. Out of his body there seemed to be coming a great flame, which was intensely bright and cast no shadow. He told me in a horrible way that I had indeed escaped out of his hands but he would get hold of me still. I was very much afraid and made the sign of the Cross as well as I could, whereupon he disappeared, but immediately returned again. This happened twice running and I did not know what to do. But there was some holy water there, so I flung some in the direction of the apparition, and it never came back…From long experience I have learned that there is nothing like holy water to put devils to flight and prevent them from coming back again. They also flee from the Cross, but return; so holy water must have great virtue.

Holy water is a sacramental of the Church that invokes the saving power of God. Furthermore, holy water has a double meaning of reminding us of our baptism as well as a symbol of spiritual cleansing. Holy water is said to have great power over the devil as the devil cannot stand this “clean” water, since he is entirely unclean for all eternity. It is a reminder of the water that flowed out of Christ’s side, which is a symbol of Baptism, and brings to mind the day of the devil’s defeat (Christ’s crucifixion).

God always provides a way to conquer evil!

2 Prayers to banish evil from a house or room

Dispel the powers of darkness that may be in this room and protect me this night ...

A beautiful and powerful prayer from Night Prayer of the Liturgy of the Hours on special solemnities:

Lord, we \[or I\] beg you to visit this house \[room\] and banish from it all the deadly power of the enemy. May your holy angels dwell here to keep us in peace, and may your blessings be upon us always. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

A prayer written by Fr. Edward Looney, which he uses especially when he is staying in a hotel during his travels:

Almighty God, I ask you to send your angels to be with me in this place, and protect me from all assaults of the Evil One. Please forgive any wrong that has been perpetuated in this room, and grant those who offend you the grace of conversion. Dispel the powers of darkness that may be in this room and protect me this night, and those who will sleep here in the forthcoming nights. Jesus, I trust in You!

Priest: Why holy water comes with me whenever I travel

Fr. Edward Looney explains why he brings holy water with him into every hotel room, and shares the prayers he prays.

Every now and again, I have the opportunity to travel and speak at conferences, sharing about Mary’s importance in the spiritual life. When I do so, I usually have to spend the night in a hotel room. One of the essentials I pack (or because I’m a priest, can make) is a small bottle of holy water.

Why? Three words: Evil is real. The presence of evil can remain in a room long after whatever might have taken place within it. You don’t know who was the previous occupant of your hotel room and what kind of baggage they brought with them. You don’t know what has occurred in your room. Holy water is a powerful tool in protecting against evil and can help dispel any remnant of evil.

The next time you travel, might I suggest packing a small bottle of holy water? When you arrive at your room, sprinkle the room with holy water. If you don’t have holy water, your local Catholic parish should have a holy water dispenser.

After sprinkling the room, say a prayer, asking God to send his protection upon your room and asking also to forgive whatever evil that may have taken place. Pray for the conversion of those who have been previous guests, and pray for those who will come after you.

Here’s a prayer that I wrote for such an occasion:

Almighty God, I ask you to send your angels to be with me in this place, and protect me from all assaults of the Evil One. Please forgive any wrong that has been perpetuated in this room, and grant those who offend you the grace of conversion. Dispel the powers of darkness which may be in this room and protect me this night, and those who will sleep here in the forthcoming nights. Jesus I trust in You!.

It’s not a bad idea to pray, also, for the hotel workers moving from one room to another, exposed to supernatural who-knows-what.

Another beautiful and powerful prayer you could say comes from Night Prayer of the Liturgy of the Hours on special solemnities. It is a prayer I often pray in these situations:

Lord, we \[or I\] beg you to visit this house \[room\] and banish from it all the deadly power of the enemy. May your holy angels dwell here to keep us in peace, and may your blessings be upon us always.  We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen.

Additionally, you may wish to invoke the intercession of St. Michael the Archangel or your guardian angel. With prayer and holy water, you will be protected from the remnants of evil and prepared should a spiritual battle arise.",Christianity,t3_dkl4iu

"People love to acknowledge PK’s in a negative light but when it’s time to give honor or acknowledgement in a positive light, people forget PK’s exist I’m a PK, but a little more context to understand where I’m coming from. This year I went through a hard patch in life my ex husband abandoned me and spread horrible rumors about me to try to justify himself (I’m 23). That’s not my point tho, my point is during this period almost at the church and I mean almost everyone had something negative to say.. I heard people sayin “how could a pastors kid do such things” etc, all while expecting to take up leading worship, becoming a leader at this program we have, helping out my parents with the praying and visiting or members, and doing many other things at church with a happy smile, and I God forbid I missed a service because every member would complain to my parents or God forbid I said I couldn’t help out because I was busy (I wasn’t able to mourn the death of marriage or the death of previous normal life properly till recently because of this)

today was Pastors Day and usually at other churches they celebrate the whole family.. but today it was all about my dad and mom which is great because my dad is a great pastor, and they had never celebrated my mom till this year so I feel like we were moving forward in the right direction. Regardless I felt so unappreciated because no one acknowledged what me or my sister do for the church, but then have audacity to complain when we can’t or won’t help out bringing up the excuse that we are pastors kids and it’s out duty.. 

 I began to wonder why do churches love to put down pastors kids but won’t try in anyway to acknowledge them or thank them for also working with the family? Especially when you consider that we didn’t choose this life we were kinda dragged into it. I’m not mad just hurt at the whole situation and the lack of appreciation people have sometimes including my parents

According to Church Tradition, until the 3rd day, the soul usually dwells on earth. During the first 2 days, it enjoys relative freedom, and the soul is allowed - along with the Angels - to walk on the earth where it wants to visit friends and relatives.  
On the 9th day, the angels lift the soul up to God to worships its Creator.  
Between the 9th and 40th days the Angels show hell to the soul.  
On the 40th day the Lord determines the place of imprisonment appropriate for the deeds of the soul.

"Is it possible that Hell was a lie that God had to use in order to make Earth a less sinful place? Read... One of the biggest debates in christianity vs atheism is the existence of Heaven and Hell. In my opinion, I believe God has had to make the choices necessary for us to at least have the chance to follow him. Why do you think God would have to tell us that if we value a life of sin, of evil, of wrongdoing, and that if we don’t believe in Him that we would go to Hell? I believe Heaven is real, but I am still deciding as to if Hell exist, and this is why.
I believe everyone should have the opportunity to go to Heaven. Now hear me out, because I know religious people are going to be furious with me, so please stay openminded and nonjudgmental. So why do i believe this? I believe this because 1)If God loves us so much then why should we have to suffer eternal damnation in Hell? 
2)Most people who have chosen to not believe in Him really haven’t had the free will to choose him or not...because our own environment we are born in is what decides what we choose to believe. 
3)Most people who have chosen to do something sinful or something that is evil in the most extreme have had a life that they didn’t choose, or a life that has created them to be mentally unstable and mentally ill... Which is a result of the environment they were born in.
4) If God was to say we are all allowed to go to Heaven, then what would the world look like today? It would be a world full of sin, a world where everyone would do whatever they please. I know many who would say this would be an awesome place live in, but truly it wouldn’t. You would suffer from the pain of others, and others would suffer from the pain of you. There would be no order, no morals or beliefs. Only bad things would happen, there would be no GOOD, only evil. People would care less if they killed another person because their answer as to why they committed murder would be, “He is going to Heaven anyway, why does it matter?” Ultimately, if he said everyone is allowed into Heaven when they die, then people would probably kill themselves in order to go to heaven.

So... why should we blame him if He was to lie to us? Well i dont think we should blame him if He was to lie. I know i wouldn’t. He wanted us to have the choice to actually experience what he has. He has experienced sorrow, pain, betrayal, manipulation, evil,etc...but he has also experienced happiness, joy, love, sympathy and empathy. Aren’t all of these things present in this world? The result of man wanting to be like him, to have the will to choose what we want, to have the right to choose between good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and sin also has to come with everything He has been through as well...the pain and the sorrow he has experienced. God has experienced everything we have as a whole, but the thing that sets Him apart from us other than being a Supreme being and Creator is He is the only one who has resisted temptation and sin. 
In the beginning I believe God set an experiment(Creation) to see if Man could resist what we ultimately wanted. We wanted to be Him. Nobody has been worthy. So that until we die, here on earth, we shall suffer the result of what we ultimately wanted (to be like him, to experience what he was). The result of wanting to be like Him creates only sympathy for Him in the end, and it also creates an understanding that we will never be like Him because we have never succeeded in becoming Him(Someone who has created life, and resisted temptation). We have created life here on Earth, but we have never resisted sin and temptation like he has on earth. This goes to my next point...

So many people may ask, “If God knows everything, why would he created the devil to tempt us to make us sin?” Well...Because he already knew Man would want to be like Him. I dont believe the Devil created sin, and I dont believe Man created sin. I believe God created the devil to create sin to tempt Man so we could understand and sympathize with Him through what we experience on Earth. If we were created in His image don’t you think that also means everything He is we are. And by “everything He is we are,” i mean everything Has experienced, and  the right to choose between good and bad.” He set us up to want to be like Him... only to show that we could never be like Him because he is Supreme and because He is one of a kind. How other way could God show He is Supreme other than showing us that we can never accomplish what he has? And how other way could God create Man to show empathy and to sympathize with Him then to show us everything he has been through? This should create love for Him because God has been through it all and yet he still loves us. Man could never face what he has faced and still choose to love those who have done us wrong. This is what he wants of us, but it will never happen because we aren’t as special as he is.

As a man who has partial faith and who is still deciding on what he believes. I believe these things that I say are only what I believe. I believe all of this makes the most since to me, and that is why I choose Christianity over every other religion. I am not saying this is what you should choose to believe, and I don’t want to misconstrue the Word of God...because it is highly probably that I could be wrong, but if my desire is to believe in God, and if I have faith that he is real, then why not choose to believe in something like this that doesn’t change my love for Him at all...but only makes me understand and love Him more...",Christianity,t3_dkrsnu

"I’m a Christian, I am not Christ It must be understood – that the special abilities that Christ gave to the Apostles, were of limited duration. The miracles performed in the 1st Century – were for the establishment of Christianity in the face of Judaism and the Pagan world at large. The Bible was not yet fully compiled and there was a need for miracles in order to convince the established belief systems that there was a newcomer to this sphere of human activity. In other words, the miracles advertised Christianity.

The apostle Paul gave a sobering perspective on the miraculous abilities of the Apostles:

**“All the special gifts and powers from God will someday come to an end, but love goes on forever. Someday prophecy and speaking in unknown languages and special knowledge—these gifts will disappear. Now we know so little, even with our special gifts, and the preaching of those most gifted is still so poor. But when we have been made perfect and complete, then the need for these inadequate special gifts will come to an end, and they will disappear.”** ***-*** **1 Corinthians 13:8-10** Living Bible

What marked the end of miracles? It was the “perfected” compilation of the Holy Scriptures. Once the Bible canon was completed, the Good News was no longer required to be advertised by miracles; it was simply advertised as a religion, with teachings and doctrines. And unfortunately, the State took over as the power behind the superficial form of Christianity that replaced the God-backed version outlined in the Bible.

What does that mean for us today?

It means Christians – should not even attempt trying to convince people using miraculous powers; such as speaking in tongues. There are some who claim they have witnessed amazing events – but in the light of Scientific investigation – their claims are usually proven to be mistaken at best or were pure scams at worse. Trying to convince people through miracles which will invariably turn out to be fakes can only damage the reputation of the Christian.

So – what can Christians do instead of miracles? They have to show love to their fellow human beings. And if they are rejected and even persecuted – they must show love all the more.

**“I say, love your enemies! Pray for those who persecute you!” - Matthew 5:44** New Living Translation

"Why do I cry when I pray? Small intro: 

I was baptized as a child, now sixteen. My mother’s side is Christian, but I was not raised in a religious family. I only knew bits and pieces about Christianity through others or through media. 

Two and a half years ago, my friend invited me to go to his youth group. Built a community there and I’ve been going ever since (as well as a second church since our youth pastor switched churches and I wanted to keep up with both groups).

———

It’s all still very new to me. I ask questions to grasp any of the concepts better and always participate in small group. When it comes to prayer, every time I have felt myself start to tear up. Does this mean anything? 

The Bible is fascinating and I’d like to learn about it. I don’t care so much about all the rules; not that I’ll go out of my way to break them, but rather prioritizing the “love God” and “love your neighbour as you love yourself”. Above all else, that is the most important. A connection with God, a connection with others, and a connection with yourself. Understanding the rest of the morality and logistics within the Bible is second priority to me, but it all goes back to loving God and loving others. 

I don’t know if I’ve ever felt a spiritual connection with God. I’ve prayed and I’ve been to Church and I’ve taken the time to ask questions and understand it all. But does tearing up during prayer actually mean anything, or am I just that bad at regulating my emotions? Should I let myself believe this is powerful and spiritual, or do I try to hide it and continue to ignore it? What does a spiritual connection even feel like? Physically and emotionally, what should I feel, and how do I know? 

I’ve tried to decipher what I feel when I cry, the why of it all, but it’s very empty. I am not sad. I am not frustrated. I am not hurt. Perhaps touched and joyful, but that’s not the main thing. So could it just be that spiritual connection to God, or am I over exaggerating something else?",Christianity,t3_dkglsz

"A guide for confession (from The Way of a Pilgrim) Next day, by God’s help, I came to Kiev. The first and chief thing I wanted was to fast a while and to make my confession and communion in that holy town. So I stopped near the saints as that would be easier for getting to church. A good old Cossack took me in, and as he lived alone in his hut, I found peace and quiet there. At the end of a week, in which I had been getting ready for my confession, the thought came to me that I would make it as detailed as I could. So I began to recall and go over all my sins from youth onward very fully, and so as not to forget it all I wrote down everything I could remember in the utmost detail. I covered a large sheet of paper with it. I heard that at Kitaevaya Pustina, about five miles from Kiev, there was a priest of ascetic life who was very wise and understanding. Whoever went to him for confession found an atmosphere of tender compassion and came away with teaching for his salvation and ease of spirit. I was very glad to hear of this, and I went to him at once. After I had asked his advice and we had talked awhile, I gave him my sheet of paper to see.

He read it through and then said, “Dear friend, a lot of this that you have written is quite futile. Listen: First, don’t bring into confession sins which you have already repented of and had forgiven. Don’t go over them again, for that would be to doubt the power of the sacrament of penance. Next, don’t call to mind other people who have been connected with your sins; judge yourself only. Thirdly, the holy Fathers forbid us to mention all the circumstances of the sins, and tell us to acknowledge them in general, so as to avoid temptation both for ourselves and for the priest. Fourthly, you have come to repent and you are not repenting of the fact that you can’t repent—that is, your penitence is lukewarm and careless. Fifthly, you have gone over all these details, but the most important thing you have overlooked: you have not disclosed the gravest sins of all. You have not acknowledged, nor written down, that you do not love God, that you hate your neighbor, that you do not believe in God’s Word, and that you are filled with pride and ambition. A whole mass of evil, and all our spiritual depravity is in these four sins. They are the chief roots out of which spring the shoots of all the sins into which we fall.”

I was very much surprised to hear this, and I said, “Forgive me, reverend Father, but how is it possible not to love God our creator and preserver? What is there to believe in if not the Word of God, in which everything is true and holy? I wish well to all my neighbors, and why should I hate them? I have nothing to be proud of; besides having numberless sins, I have nothing at all which is fit to be praised, and what should I with my poverty and ill-health lust after? Of course, if I were an educated man, or rich, then no doubt I should be guilty of the things you spoke of.”

“It’s a pity, dear one, that you so little understood what I said. Look! It will teach you more quickly if I give you these notes. They are what I always use for my own confession. Read them through, and you will see clearly enough an exact proof of what I said to you just now.” He gave me the notes, and I began to read them, as follows:

*A Confession Which Leads The Inward Man To Humility*

Turning my eyes carefully upon myself and watching the course of my inward state, I have verified by experience that I do not love God, that I have no love for my neighbors, that I have no religious belief, and that I am filled with pride and sensuality. All this I actually find in myself as a result of detailed examination of my feelings and conduct, thus:

**I do not love God.** For if I loved God I should be continually thinking about Him with heart-felt joy. Every thought of God would give me gladness and delight. On the contrary, I much more often and much more eagerly think about earthly things, and thinking about God is labor and dryness. If I loved God, then talking with Him in prayer would be my nourishment and delight and would draw me to unbroken communion with Him. But, on the contrary, I not only find no delight in prayer, but even find it an effort. I struggle with reluctance, I am enfeebled by sloth and am ready to occupy myself eagerly with any unimportant trifle, if only it shortens prayer and keeps me from it. My time slips away unnoticed in futile occupations, but when I am occupied with God, when I put myself into His presence, every hour seems like a year. If one person loves another, he thinks of him throughout the day without ceasing, he pictures him to himself, he cares for him, and in all circumstances his beloved friend is never out of his thoughts. But I, throughout the day, scarcely set aside even a single hour in which to sink deep down into meditation upon God, to inflame my heart with love of Him, while I eagerly give up twenty-three hours as fervent offerings to the idols of my passions. I am forward in talk about frivolous matters and things which degrade the spirit; that gives me pleasure. But in the consideration of God I am dry, bored, and lazy. Even if I am unwillingly drawn by others into spiritual conversation, I try to shift the subject quickly to one which pleases my desires. I am tirelessly curious about novelties, about civic affairs and political events; I eagerly seek the satisfaction of my love of knowledge in science and art, and in ways of getting things I want to possess. But the study of the law of God, the knowledge of God and of religion, make little impression on me, and satisfy no hunger of my soul. I regard these things not only as a non-essential occupation for a Christian, but in a casual way as a sort of side-issue with which I should perhaps occupy my spare time, at odd moments. To put it shortly, if love for God is recognized by the keeping of His commandments (“If ye love Me, keep My commandments,” says our Lord Jesus Christ), and I not only do not keep them, but even make little attempt to do so, then in absolute truth the conclusion follows that I do not love God. That is what Basil the Great says: “The proof that a man does not love God and His Christ lies in the fact that he does not keep His commandments.”

**I do not love my neighbor either.** For not only am I unable to make up my mind to lay down my life for his sake (according to the gospel), but I do not even sacrifice my happiness, well-being, and peace for the good of my neighbor. If I did love him as myself, as the gospel bids, his misfortunes would distress me also, his happiness would bring delight to me too. But, on the contrary, I listen to curious, unhappy stories about my neighbor, and I am not distressed; I remain quite undisturbed or, what is still worse, I find a sort of pleasure in them. Bad conduct n the part of my brother I do not cover up with love, but proclaim broad with censure. His well-being, honor, and happiness do not delight me as my own, and, as if they were something quite alien to me, give me no feeling of gladness. What is more, they subtly rouse in me feelings of envy or contempt.

**I have no religious belief.** Neither in immortality nor in the gospel. If I were firmly persuaded and believed without doubt that beyond the grave lies eternal life and recompense for the deeds of this life, I should be continually thinking of this. The very idea of immortality would terrify me and I should lead this life as a foreigner who gets ready to enter his native land. On the contrary, I do not even think about eternity, and I regard the end of this earthly life as the limit of my existence. The secret thought nestles within me: Who knows what happens at death? If I say I believe in immortality, then I am speaking about my mind only, and my heart is far removed from a firm conviction about it. That is openly witnessed to by my conduct and my constant care to satisfy the life of the senses. Were the holy gospel taken into my heart in faith, as the Word of God, I should be continually occupied with it, I should study it, find delight in it, and with deep devotion fix my attention upon it. Wisdom, mercy, and love are hidden in it; it would lead me to happiness, I should find gladness in the study of the law of God day and night. In it I should find nourishment like my daily bread, and my heart would be drawn to the keeping of its laws. Nothing on earth would be strong enough to turn me away from it. On the contrary, if now and again I read or hear the Word of God, yet even so it is only from necessity or from a general love of knowledge, and approaching it without any very close attention I find it dull and uninteresting. I usually come to the end of the reading without any profit, only too ready to change over to secular reading in which I take more pleasure and find new and interesting subjects. 

**I am full of pride and sensual self-love.** All my actions confirm this. Seeing something good in myself, I want to bring it into view, or to pride myself upon it before other people or inwardly to admire myself for it. Although I display an outward humility, yet I ascribe it all to my own strength and regard myself as superior to others, or at least no worse than they. If I notice a fault in myself, I try to excuse it; I cover it up by saying, “I am made like that” or “I am not to blame.” I get angry with those who do not treat me with respect and consider them unable to appreciate the value of people. I brag about my gifts: my failures in any undertaking I regard as a personal insult. I murmur, and I find pleasure in the unhappiness of my enemies. If I strive after anything good it is for the purpose of winning praise, or spiritual self-indulgence, or earthly consolation. In a word, I continually make an idol of myself and render it uninterrupted service, seeking in all things the pleasures of the senses and nourishment for my sensual passions and lusts. 

Going over all this I see myself as proud, adulterous, unbelieving, without love for God and hating my neighbor. What state could be more sinful? The condition of the spirits of darkness is better than mine. They, although they do not love God, hate men, and live upon pride, yet at least believe and tremble. But I? Can there be a doom more terrible than that which faces me, and what sentence of punishment will be more severe than that upon the careless and foolish life that I recognize in myself?

________________

On reading through this form of confession which the priest gave me I was horrified, and I thought to myself, “Good heavens! What frightful sins there are hidden within me, and up to now I’ve never noticed them!” The desire to be cleansed from them made me beg this great spiritual father to teach me how to know the causes of all these evils and how to cure them. And he began to instruct me.

“You see, dear brother, the cause of not loving God is want of belief, want of belief is caused by lack of conviction, and the cause of that is failure to seek for holy and true knowledge, indifference to the light of the spirit. In a word, if you don’t believe, you can’t love; if you are not convinced, you can’t believe, and in order to reach conviction you must get a full and exact knowledge of the matter before you. By meditation, by the study of God’s Word, and by noting your experience, you must arouse in your soul a thirst and a longing or, as some call it, ‘wonder’- which brings you an insatiable desire to know things more closely and more fully, to go deeper into their nature. One spiritual writer speaks of it in this way: ‘Love,’ he says, ‘usually grows with knowledge, and the greater the depth and extent of the knowledge the more love there will be, the more easily the heart will soften and lay itself open to the love of God, as it diligently gazes upon the very fullness and beauty of the divine nature and His unbounded love for men.’ “So now you see that the cause of those sins which you read over is slothfulness in thinking about spiritual things, sloth which stifles the feeling of the need of such thought. If you want to know how to overcome this evil, strive after enlightenment of spirit by every means in your power; attain it by diligent study of the Word of God and of the holy Fathers, by the help of meditation and spiritual counsel, and by the conversation of those who are wise in Christ. Ah, dear brother, how much disaster we meet with just because we are lazy about seeking light for our souls through the word of truth. We do not study God’s law day and night, and we do not pray about it diligently and unceasingly. And because of this our inner man is hungry and cold, starved, so that it has no strength to take a bold step forward upon the road of righteousness and salvation! And so, beloved, let us resolve to make use of these methods, and as often as possible fill our minds with thoughts of heavenly things; and love, poured down into our hearts from on high, will burst into flame within us. We will do this together and pray as often as we can, for prayer is the chief and strongest means for our renewal and well-being. We will pray, in the words holy church teaches us: ‘O God, make me fit to love Thee now, as I have loved sin in the past.’ ”",Christianity,t3_dkdh7h
"New Convert, Troubles with Faith and Belief Hey guys! Sorry if this gets long. I’ve been going through a lot of soul-searching lately and I would like your honest thoughts. I don’t know how to talk about this stuff anywhere else. Thank you so much for bearing with me. 

Before Christianity, I was a *very* spiritual agnostic. I believed in God, although I wasn’t sure what shape he took or what his ideals were.  All I knew was that I wanted to give my life to serve God, because He created me. I believed that God had not revealed Himself to me, but when He did, I would accept His commands with open arms.

I was also a scientist at heart. I’m pretty “educated” and know a good bit of physics, astronomy, chemistry and biology (I major in biochemistry). Needless to say, I was bombarded over and over, and over some more, with ideas such as the astronomical time scale, evolution, mass extinctions/earth’s time scale, etc. 

I decided to try Christianity because my very intimate boyfriend of several years was involved in it. As an agnostic, this was a non-issue. I wanted to grow and serve God, and here was a way I could do it. However, it would mean I would immerse myself in the faith and learn to truly believe in it with all of my heart, dissolving my agnostic origins. 

I’ve committed to try to understand the Bible, growing a new way of believing the world, but I’m struggling hard. I believe in Jesus, but the Old Testament is just about to choke me. [This next bit is me venting my frustration and you’re welcome to skip it] [Otherwise if you can answer or help me with any of the doubts I’m about to list, please help] Things like the idea of demons (where are they now?), angels mating with people, the multiple-author theory of the Torah, the uncanny resemblance of the Flood and other Mesopotamian flood myths, Creation story in entirety (why was there a fruit of knowledge?), the problem of evil existing at all, people living 900 years, geological inconsistencies, etc. I’ve spent weeks tirelessly reading and praying, trying to reconcile, but I’m wearing myself totally thin. I can’t live my life feeling the weight of this spiritual pain I’m in. I’ve kind of given up and now I’m in blind faith, but it feels half-assed and selfish of me. I can’t bring myself to read anymore of my bible because I don’t want to rip open that nasty wound of doubt again. 

My lovely boyfriend is absolutely zero support. “Is it that hard to just believe?” He just... doesn’t understand at all. I want to commit my life to God’s service, it’s the only purpose I feel anymore. I can’t take it lightly. 

I’ve read through the book “The Case for Faith” and it’s brought me more solace than any other reading. The author, a former atheist, seems to be made from the same metal as me. But sources like him seem so few and far between. It’s just so easy to believe for some people, and I want to believe too. 

TLDR: Former agnostic converting to Christianity. Doubt has stubbed my toes so many times that I don’t have feet anymore. But still crawling. Advice appreciated.

"Analogy to understand God's Grace So let's say you have a job and a family to provide for. Your boss's policy is if you are ever late, you will be fired. One day, you wake up and it's 0830, you were supposed to be at work by 0800. What is going through your mind? You're about to lose your job, how will you explain this to your spouse, how will you feed your kids, will I be homeless? Etc so you walk into your boss's office expecting to be fired with all of this on your heart. Then he says ""don't worry about it, mistakes happen"" Allll of that weight just immediately left your heart, all because of the Mercy your boss showed you.

So here's two different ways this can go (two different ways Christianity goes)

1. You wake up and think to yourself, maybe if I get to work sooner, my boss might let it slide. So what do you do? You speed to work. You try to earn your boss's forgiveness and put other driver's lives at risk. Christians do this by trying to earn God's grace. This makes people controlling, judgemental, etc (hypocritical)

2. Let's say your boss has a policy to forgive the first offense. If you're already late, why not take your time and make breakfast? You're already forgiven so why rush? This is Christians sinning more to take advantage of grace.

So one important thing to note about the very first one. This weight being lifted off your heart (call it a change of heart) can only happen with two conditions 1. Understanding your judgement and what you're about to lose
2. This happens after the Mercy is given. So the Mercy isn't given until you get to work

So technically with God we shouldn't be able to receive grace until we face God at judgement after we die.

And this is what makes Christianity true and glorious: because of Jesus Christ, we are able to RECEIVE this grace RIGHT NOW. When we understand where we stand before God because of our sin and believe that Jesus is the Son of God and is risen, God will CHANGE OUR HEARTS just like in the analogy and give us the Holy Spirit. This change of heart will make you never want to be late to work again, it will set you free from the control of sin and teach you to live by grace. This is what Titus 2:11 means. Of course you will still sin sometimes but it won't be deliberate and you'll know it because the Spirit will tell you, and you learn from it.

This is what it means to truly understand grace, to be forgiven and to live your life by the power of the Spirit and showing others this grace like God has shown you!",Christianity,t3_dkdygc

In the jewish tradition, there was a figure who worked for God and he tempted people but wasn’t seen as an adversary to god. This wasn’t the case until they combined all the stories of evil entities and made them what some may know today to be satan. A tempter and God’s adversary.

"My struggles with God DISCLAIMER: I am only seeking answers I truly want to get right with god . Ive just really struggled wrapping my mind around the conditions we live in. 




I honestly don’t know where to start but, I’ve been hot and cold with my faith over the years. Lately I’ve been thinking deeply about the concept of god the all knowing and powerful being, but the Bible and my state of existence just seem “unnecessarily dramatic”.  Lately I feel as if god created me and all of humanity simply for entertainment. Our conditions and struggles are for what? I was born to be a self loathing sinner, destined to an eternity of torture. I’ve been told I must defy the very nature instilled into my body at birth. I was told that I am evil automatically (just for existing).  I don’t want to be evil, I don’t even want to exist. I feel that we were created to serve as some form of soap opera to keep God entertained like a drama film.   I often ask myself “If all the evil and suffering in the world saddens and angers the almighty, then why has nothing in recent times been done to correct or help...? Why has god chosen to turn his back and, just watch as his beloved creation falls into the repetitive pattern of self destruction and agony..?” The arguments often given by my youth pastors and peers growing up have always been along the lines of “God gave man free will”, or “it all began when sin entered the world” blaming Adam and Eve for the short comings of us all. According to what I’ve always been told, god knows all my thoughts and actions from the past, future and the present. But as a Father figure why are these destructive qualities allowed to flourish..? As a child my parents would always notice a bad behavior or trait and work on correcting it, in order to help me. My good parents guided me personally and to the best of their ability guarded and limited my actions in order to stop any further damage that I may inflict on myself or others. Why is this not the case with Thee Father? To me it sounds like the king of kings settled for anarchy. Our all knowing loving father knew 1/3 of the angles would fall and he knew that another countless number of human souls would fall as well but he created us anyways. He knew my loved ones would die to their addictions and diseases and yet he sent us on down anyways. I didn’t ask for this and neither did any of the other poor souls in this world. We’re just told that we have to keep moving and we’re forced to love something that created the sin and evil we know all too well ( im told that “God is perfect, God couldn’t have created evil. it was the deeds of man and the deceiver.”) and I retort ( God the FATHER created the very beings that introduced evil and sin and he did so knowing that it was bound to happen knowing fully that we are flawed. And yet he did it anyways”). In our world if a child is to steal from a store or commit a high profile crime that reflects fully on the parents and their lack of...well, parenting and love for the child.  Instead I’m expected to announce that I am an evil, inferior and disgusting I am told that I must beg for forgiveness because my actions reflect my natural instincts and the environment I was brought up in.” (Against my will) This to me just makes god seem sadistic and narcissistic. Please, try to help me understand. I’d much rather be capable of blind faith rather then finding myself in a paradox of endless questions and circles never finding true peace of mind. I want to believe this world and, all it’s ugliness are necessary to reach a goal that benefits us all  but instead the evidence I’ve gathered has lead me to believe that the human condition is nothing more than unnecessary struggle that could have very well been avoided. I know for a fact we all just want an escape from the pain and weight we carry on our backs.

For example, somebody practicing the Islamic religion can be 100% committed and sure of their religion without a doubt, just like I am about Christianity. But are they wrong for that?

"Church leaders *1Timothy3:1This is a true saying: If a man is eager to be a church leader, he desires an excellent work. 2 A church leader must be without fault; he must have only one wife, be sober, self-controlled, and orderly; he must welcome strangers in his home; he must be able to teach; 3 he must not be a drunkard or a violent man, but gentle and peaceful; he must not love money; 4 he must be able to manage his own family well and make his children obey him with all respect. 5 For if a man does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of the church of God? 6 He must be mature in the faith, so that he will not swell up with pride and be condemned, as the Devil was. 7 He should be a man who is respected by the people outside the church, so that he will not be disgraced and fall into the Devil's trap.*

It makes sense that to be a leader you must practice what you preach.  You should have it together enough that you are a mature Christian, not one still languishing in your sins.   We all sin, even the best of us, but to be a preacher, you should at least be resisting them very well.

"Modern music with Christian influences? I first started going to church in the late 2000s, and listening to Christian music. It seemed like the music they were playing back then was somehow better than what I hear these days, maybe it's just me being young at the time. I still listen to the same station but the music now is just often boring to me. I don't know if it's just me or if something changed. There are some songs I really like such as ""Fear No More"" and ""Dead Man Walking"" and I'm not sure why I like certain songs like that. But other times it makes me want to fall asleep.

Also, I remember there used to be a lot of bands back then that weren't really on the Christian labels or genre but had lyrics that were Christian at times. A lot of these are overplayed but I still like them. I used to hear songs like How To Save a Life by The Fray and Home by Chris Daughtry on the Christian station and also on secular ones. And Owl City too.

There don't seem to be bands anymore like these that aren't really Christian worship, but can be interpreted as such, and where some of them fit both secular and Christian genres. These days it's mostly Lauren Daigle, who I admit is overplayed lately, but I still like her music too on the Christian station.

It seems like this kind of music was popular around 2007-2012, then it went away. A friend of mine used to like Mumford and Son, that had Christian meaning in a way too.

One of my friends introduced me to Christian rock bands like Anberlin, Classic Crime, Falling UP, FF5, Thousand Foot Krutch, SwitchFoot, Relient K, Skillet, etc. Some of these bands still produce music, but what happened, why aren't there new bands like this, or am I missing something?

Even songs like Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol almost seem like worship songs when I listen to them at points, even though that's not their intention.

For more info, these two scholars were Jordan Peterson, a prominent psychologist at University of Toronto and the other was Stefan Molyneux, a well known philosopher. 

Jordan Peterson claimed that according to the data, White/Jewish/Asian Male have an IQ that is within the range of 100~110. Where as Blacks and Hispanics have an average IQ below 90. In countries like Congo or Ghana, average population IQ is 60~70. As a matter of fact, this is why the illiteracy rate is so high in these countries. Furthermore, IQ is purely genetic and it is nearly impossible to improve even if it's just 2 points basis.

"Giving someone $1 does make a difference For the longest time I always felt guilty and condemned because I only gave $1-2 to people asking for money. I felt convicted by the scriptures about helping others in need, and $1-2 felt like a joke. I felt like helping had to be sacrificial, like letting someone in the streets move into my room. My heart just isn't big enough to let someone living in the streets to live in my room or even take a shower or even just give a decent amount of money. I've always felt ashamed of this and feared that I will pay for it come judgement day. Eventually I shut down and got into a selfish habit of just saying no sorry (and feeling ashamed every time) when someone would ask for change.

But over time, I've been experiencing poverty more and more. Before without any thought, I used to buy $5 drinks at Starbucks every day and go to restaurants regularly but for some time now I realized that is no longer an option. I'm not able to have the luxury of a coffee drink anymore. Even a haircut which I used to get every two weeks seems like a pricey thing now.

These changes in my life made me realize the value of a dollar more. So now, instead of viewing giving someone $1 as shameful, I realize that the $1 is way more valuable to that person than it is to me even in my current state. Another thing is that people in places like India work extremely hard the whole day and make only $2 or less, maybe even as low as 50 cents. So it is actually a huge blessing giving someone a dollar.

I am motivated now to give at least a dollar or more if I can manage, more regularly. I shouldn't feel guilty about it just being a dollar and should be encouraged to give more. If people around the world work for only 50 cents a day, people in America should be very happy for receiving a dollar. Honestly, now a dollar seems very valuable to me, and I will be way more cautious of what I spend money on now, but not be selfish and hold it back from others. Maybe just try to sacrifice something I waste money on like chocolate, and give that money instead to someone who asks for it.

"Battle pornography    Hi guys. I'm a 16 year old male struggling with pornography. 

   The first time looked at pornography is when I was 10-11. When I was around 12, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior. From that day, I learned that pornography is a sin, however, until now I still watch porn.

   Porn is destroying me. It changes the way I look at woman and how I view love. Its horrible. One time I prayed to God to help me repent from watching pornography. God answered my prayer instantly by this verse: 

Matthew 6:33: ""But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.""

    Immediately what came to my mind is that I rarely read the Bible and pray to God. Which is true.

"Isaiah 14:29, is Lucifer proverbially Jesus? In Isaiah 14 the Israelites, who have been less than faithful to YHWH, meet a figure known as Lucifer who they accuse of being blasphemous and they prophesy his downfall and death but he seems to resurrect?

From Isaiah 14:10 - onward, the Israelites seem to be accusing the Lucifer figure of willing to ascend above the terrestrial, into deity, and aspiring to assume God’s domain, while also saying that he will fail, he will die.

All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become weak as we? art thou become like unto us? Your pomp is brought down to Sheol, And the sound of your stringed instruments; The maggot is spread under you, And worms cover you.’- Isaiah 14:10-11

This line of rhetoric by the Israelites continues with the infamous 14:12, “how art thou fallen”

However, my curiosity rises sharply at 14:29.

Rejoice ye not, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. - Isaiah 14:29

Isaiah seems to be speaking to the Israelites and warning them to not rejoice, why? Death, maggots, resurrection?

Furthermore, the serpent’s root is generally considered to be The Tribe of Dan, the rejected tribe, a Cockatrice could easily be called a Phoenix, a symbol of resurrection even before Isaiah was written or perhaps a symbol of paradox, hinting at hybrid elements like that of Man and God in a single entity but most odd is “His offspring will be a fiery flying serpent”, isn’t this considered a symbol of Christ and Hebraic Divinity?

When I read Isaiah 14 specifically, it feels as though I’m reading two different writers, one is mystical and proverbial and the other is completely terrestrial, as though there was an original writer who was saying one thing and someone else who is writing around the other’s work. I have severe issues with things like this in the Bible. Revelation 22:16 has often caused confusion for many laymen of theological or mythological study of the Bible for it’s use of The Morning Star in reference to Jesus as they think it has some correlation with Lucifer but “the root and offspring” also seems to be mirrored both in Isaiah (Lucifer) and Revelation (Jesus).

To understand why I’m giving it a mythological reading I would briefly explain The Garden of Eden.

Elohim (masculine-feminine-plural) creates Adam-Chavah (The Living Man-epithet) and our other character is Nachash (the androgynous-fiery-shining serpent)

Elohim says “eat from every tree but not from The Tree of the The Fruit of The Knowledge of Good and Evil” The Serpent deceives with the truth “you’ll not surely die” and The Livingness (Eve) betrays the Man (Adam).

I don’t extract a commentary on morality from this but rather, The Living Man, who is Jesus, should not really concern himself with what is Good and Evil within the context of the Garden. In short, The First Beast of Revelation 13 is a beast right? He’s evil, he’s the antichrist but Revelation 13 is a direct reference to Hosea 13 where YHWH describes himself and prophesies he will be a beast of almost identical likeness. What if the beasts are the same and this good versus evil thing has been stopping us from understanding.

I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things. - Isaiah 45:7",Christianity,t3_dkcqgs

"What do you guys think of the lyrics to this song? Does Jesus ""laugh"" at guilt and shame? Hey y'all,

Haven't posted on reddit in awhile but I wanted to hear different opinions on this song. It's called *Washed* by UPPERROOM and it's a great song, really beautiful but I'm a little hung up on this line:

Then you stepped into my grave  
Laughing at the guilt and shame  
And all my fear was stripped away  
Now I stand and sing 

Do you think it's reasonable to say Jesus laughs at our guilt and shame? I totally understand the message behind the lyrics. The writer is trying to say that our guilt and shame mean nothing in light of God's glory and mercy. But let me hear your thoughts.

Here's the link to the song:

"3 things not to do when trying to convert a Wiccan Hello r/Christianity, to get started I am a Christian witch. I am not a Wiccan. I am not here to have a debate about Christian witches or Wiccans, but rather how not to lead them to Christ. Many Christians try to convert them by openly criticizing they're faith, and telling them they will burn in hell. This is,to put it simply, a horrible way to get someone to have interest in your religion. So, I'll teach you what to actually do.  I'm on mobile, so I'm sorry if the formatting is bad.

- This is absolutely the number one thing not to do. Never tell them they are worshipping Satan. Wiccans do not believe in satan,nor acknowledge the existence of him. Since Wiccans follow the threefold law and worship gods and goddesses, Satan doesn't exist. ( To shorten it: Practice whatever you'd like, but don't interrupt the free will of others, because everything you send comes back to you three times better or worse than it originally was.) There is no Satan in Wicca. There are no actual demons in Wicca, although there are demonic entities. Wiccans will not blame any outside force for temptation or sin like we blame Satan for tempting us. Accusing a Wiccan  of worshiping Satan is like accusing a Buddhist of worshipping God. Don't do it.

-Don't directly contradict your beliefs in front of them. Don't lie in front of them (Especially if you know they are physics ;)) Don't cuss in front of them. Enough said.

-Don't contradict THEIR beliefs. I'm not saying you've gotta participate in rituals or tarot readings or anything, but seriously. If they'd like to explain they're alter for Apollo? Let them. They want to explain the powers of that 60$ amythest shard they bought? Let them. Understand the religion. It's not all candles and chanting and hexes. In fact, you aren't even allowed to hex someone because of the threefold law. Different candles have different meanings. For example, green is used in luck and money rituals, but gold can work too. Red is often used in fertility and love rituals. Ask about they're charm or crystal bags, and crack a joke or too about Christianity while your at it. Don't refuse and be THAT christian, because there isn't a 100% chance you will convert them anyway. Here are a few very common things you'll find most Wiccans own.

Rose quartz:The stone of love and forgiveness, and used to create empathy. If the patron deity of this person is Aphrodite, you'll probably find some on they're alter.

Clear quartz:Used as a replacement for many crystals. Also a healing crystal.

Clover:Money and luck

Acorns:Money,luck,love,prosperity

Salt:Cleansing 

Moon water:Moon water is plain old water left under the moon for a entire night. It's mostly used in cleansing,healing,and happiness potions. It also depends on the phase of the moon.

Rainwater: Has a lot of different uses. People add it to baths for ambition and peace. It also depends if you got it from a thunderstorm,hurricane,etc.

Rosewater: Usually used for self love and happiness potions.

Roses:Love for oneself and others,also for happiness 

And that's just a few.

I hope this helped anyone trying to convert a Wiccan. Christ be with you, and blessed be. ;)",Christianity,t3_dk8urh
"A second look at parental fidelity in the Bible Given all that we know about parental abuse, the Biblical requirement to honor one’s parents seems a little bit peculiar. How can this commandment possibly account for bad or abusive parenting? What happens then?

"difference of purpose in life between a christian and atheist Christians:

3. trees, gravity, humans, animals, ants, DNA are all intricately designed and is highly engineered so thus has to be a creator. 

Atheists:

1. Ultimate purpose in life is : procreate, avoid pain, do what's best for their offspring (next generation). and seek pleasure (this is no different then a cow's purpose, dog's purpose, an ant's purpose ... I mean y'all believe y'all share the same ancestors anyways lol )
2. You go to bed and wake up \~30,000 days ( 82 years) and when death comes along then that is it.

"Social group question - what season are you in? HEY! WAIT! Please skip to the bottom if your crippled attention can’t handle many words.

When I was in high school, our youth group would go on retreats a couple times a year. The camps were always beautiful, Sharptop cove - a Young Life camp in Georgia - was one of my favorites. It was such a great time of fun, fellowship, and being poured into by spiritual leaders. And the leaders would often say things like, “Don’t let this week just be a spiritual high. Be careful, when you go home and get back into the rhythm of life, to not forget about this time.” And yet, the vast majority of us would do that very thing. We would go home, go back to school and sports, and forget entirely all the things we learned and felt during the week. It’s a pretty similar experience with coming home from short term mission trips.

My pastor and i were talking once, and he told me that Christianity falls to and from “mainstream” like a pendulum with every generation. People think we’re in spiritually low times now,  but think of the roaring 20’s. In fact, if you look at the past 100 years, you can visibly see this pattern.

~Page 42-44 of the Screwtape letters. [God’s two most powerful weapons under his tool-belt are the irresistible and the undeniable. But his plan for us, that we come to know Him and love Him freely, prevent him from fully using these tools. The problem is, these are defining characteristics for God. Which means any more than a hint of God’s presence results in automation. And there is nothing more righteous for a human, than to look around in a season where God seems entirely absent, and obey Him anyways.]

And lastly, the Bible talks about these things as well. But the greatest example of seasons, is to look at the generations of Israelites. One generation would have extreme faith and obedience, like Joshua; while the next would ask for a king despite god saying that king would royally suck. 

Sorry for a lot of words, but I’m genuinely curious to know if we’re all in similar seasons. 2018-19 were the worst two years of my life, but it seems like there’s a light on the horizon. Describe for me where you are, and let’s take note about the state of our body.",Christianity,t3_dk7892

We are beginning to create a membership for people all over the world who are Christians. WE've played with a few ideas but I wanted to ask this sub, out of these options (feel free to add options in the comments) which membership would you join?  


Making Disciples:   
A lot of churches focus on bringing people in but are weak at helping people grow in their faith that don't fit into their boxes. We would bring weekly free content, videos, blogs and emails to help you learn and grow as a disciple maker, AND monthly workshops, webinars or courses that would help you dive deeper in your faith OR/AND answer any questions that you bring up in the group. We have a few more things so if you're interested, ask questions below.  


Marriage:  
We've been married for 6 years and together for 8 years. We could'n't be more opposite as people and we've both been through a lot of trauma and thus through a lot of healing. We've done couples counseling, conflict resolution, communication styles and Ennagram. We want to help married couples through difficulty, find their spark again and move forward in unity. Same basic idea as in discipleship, weekly prompts and content with focused monthly deep dives.  


I was also thinking of starting a online Christian book club, a theology discussion group or a ministry help group for those in ministry. 

Disclaimer, some of the content would be free, but others would be available upon a small monthly membership fee of around $30.

Then today I was down on my luck and went to have free dinner at a community center and met this great guy named Justin and we talked about the power of Christ and how he can change your life and at the end he asked “you need some money man” and I said hesitantly (Um honestly I could use a few bucks) so we go to an atm and I was expecting like $10 max since he asked for $10s and $20s change from the clerk after he got cash and we walk outside and he hands me $50 - I was shocked and so happy - I had been talking to Jesus all day saying that I’m thankful to be alive and enjoying the great Texas weather despite my less than ideal living situation and past struggle with drug addiction - I have been so hungry lately that I would fantasize about getting an $6 meal combo from fast food restaurants Instead of dollar menu items that never fill me up - so tonight I enjoyed an amazing dinner $6 raising canes chicken finger combo for the first time in so long and was so thankful - you will never know how food food is until you actually starve for it - Christ is putting small thing’s in motion to let me known I have not been forgotten - when you seek good things and good people your life will inevitably get better - you can’t surround yourself with drug addicts and losers and expect your life to improve as you ARE the company you keep - can’t wait to become fully involved in a church - stay sober - surround myself with positive good people who want to better their lives ONLY - and let Christ take my life to new hights! ✌️ Testify by Social Club Misfits is my new anthem been on repeat all day !

There are people who say "". Faith is not the truth. How can we know that we believe in the truth?""

Here, Christianity stands out among the other religions. Why?

Let us remember the 12 apostles, the disciples of Jesus Christ.

In John's Gospel, Jesus warns the apostles of pending their persecution by the Jews:

All this I have told you so that you will not fall away. They will put you out of the synagogue; in fact, the time is coming when anyone who kills you will think they are offering a service to God. They will do such things because they have not known the Father or me. I have told you this, so that when their time comes you will remember that I warned you about them. I did not tell you this from the beginning because I was with you. John 16:1-4.

And now you should know that each of the apostles suffered a martyr's death. Only John the Evangelist, the only one of the 12 apostles who died a nonviolent death.

Each of them knew Christ. They could say that preached a lie, and then perhaps they would not have died. But they seem to have decided that it is better to die than to denial of Christ.

"I am terrified for my sister and her cancer diagnosis. Prayers and suggestions please. You might remember me from a few months ago, the unbeliever who's boyfriend broke up with her because ""she didn't share the same love for Christ"". I deleted my post after catching some heat and feeling embarrassed.

I started my journey, alone, within a week I received the proof that I quite literally prayed for, recommitted after continuing to search for weeks, and the rest is history but this isn't about all that.

My sister was diagnosed with cancer 4 years ago in one of her kidneys and she lost a kidney. It has come back as bone cancer with an 8 percent remission rate and I don't know if she is a believer.

I now know what my ex felt every moment I hopped on my motorcycle, what he felt when I flipped my car and they thought I had a brain bleed 3 days later (it's actually the car accident that started the storm inside of me and made me question what I really believed). I am FREAKING out, it hurts me deep within my heart and I am absolutely terrified. It is like this burning pit in my stomach and if I think too much about it I and up in tears because I am just so terrified. Sure I don't want to lose her as selfish as that is, but if she is a believer... as cliche as it sounds, I know that she will be in a better place with our mother and our nana (her favorite person).

We were raised Catholic (but mom and I ""converted"" when I was in my teens) and she still has her rosary beds on her dresser but I don't know anything beside that... how do I approach this with her? We haven't talked about me returning to my faith because I know her, she is going to tell me that I'm only doing this to try and cling to my ex and I might physically try and fight her at that point (kidding). She always says things like God had a cruel sense of humor, God did xyz to me blah so I'm very apprehensive... 

Anyone else have any advice or suggestions?

And I definitely, definitely need some prayers. Please pray for her health and if she isn't a believer that she is accepting of me trying to talk to her about it. And please pray for my tender heart going through this. I am riddled with anxiety, depression, the works and while God and I work on that every day... I need the prayers for my sanity.

Edit:

When I say prayer for her being accepting of me talking about it, it isn't from a standpoint of conversion but from a standpoint of I just need to know for my own heart and that she doesn't blow up on me and say hurtful things.

"What are some good reasons to have children if you don’t like kids? (Sorry for potential mistakes, English is my second language. Also sorry for any rude words / statements, I’m trying to be frank.)

Me and mostly my wife don’t like little children very much, to put it softly. We don’t like majority of kids we meet because how they (mis)behave, but we also don’t like most of the adults for similar reasons, so it could be just that people raise their children in their image and how most people are. We are both very tired from our daily work / managing building our house / sleep routine and we are currently living in a city while being introverts and not liking city environment, so we have very little patience with kids which make loud noises, misbehave, don’t respect their parents at all and also their parents who seemingly don’t care and ignore their children by scrolling on their smartphone. I’ve heard multiple times an iteration of a statement, that “kids are like farts – you can only tolerate your own”, which I believe is probably true, but still. Even when kids have good parents, they are often loud and running around and also crying and smelling when they are little, because they are kids and that is what kids do (and have right to do, because… they are kids). We will probably have little chance to rest and regenerate even after moving from city to our new house in the village some distance from the city. We are prepared to make sacrifices and change our lives around children to reasonable degree, but will it be worth it? As I said before, currently we are very tired from work, church activities and calling we’ve got from God (mostly because majority of people are lazy or don't do anything you don’t force them to do, so few active people do everything if they want it done, but that’s for another debate), but there are things more important in life than work.

We love small furry animals because how cute they are, but we don’t find babies and little kids cute by any stretch of imagination. I think this can potentially be a good thing, as one person in our family had a child for a single reason – to have a cute little doll to play with (literally). This child is now a married adult and the mother still has unhealthy expectations of her child and deep within she doesn’t want to reconcile with Genesis 2:24, as her cute little doll grew up and left. If we ever have children, we strongly believe that they are not our toys, slaves, nor opportunity to fulfil our unfulfilled dreams and our duty is to create environment for them to grow into fully functioning adults, which will be able to choose their own path in life, will be prepared for marriage, life and having their children, and will have as many opportunities as possible to get to know God personally along the way of growing up.

The thing, that scares us the most is whether we will be able to love our children as we are supposed to love them, when we will be tired and our energy depleted. We know that God will be in it with us and He led us through many hard times before, but still. Once you have children, you are stuck with them forever and you are responsible for raising them, so this is not light decision to make. 

Currently, the major reason for me to want to have children are the children of people I look up to. When I was younger, I admired some Christians because of their character and work they did for the Kingdom. They had kids, their kids are now teenagers or young adults (just like us) and I like how they don’t necessarily walk in their fathers and mothers footsteps, but most of them turned out to be people worthy to admire because of how they walk with God, their characters and how they do things God has called them to do. I know that there can be black sheep even if you do everything right, as every person decides on his own what he wants to do with his life, but it has turned out great in most cases I’ve seen. Great parents have great children.

So (and **tl;dr**), what are some good reasons to have children in this day and age, if you don’t like most of the babies and little kids?

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: (As I overestimated the ability of some redditors to understand written text, I think I need to clarify) We are not asking whether or not we should have children, we are asking for rational (including theological) reasons to have them. I also want to clarify that we don't hate children as people, we just currently have little patience for baby / kid common behaviour, most probably because of our current conditions, which are due to change in next months, i. e. before we  potentially have a child.",Christianity,t3_dk0bno
"Why do Christians insist that everyone follow their religious rules? Why is it that, especially in the United States, Christians think that everybody should follow the rules of their religion, and furthermore, that some of those rules should be the law of the land? I'm thinking about blue laws, abstinence-only sex education, opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. Why are Christians clamoring so hard in the US to make these things the law of land? Surely you wouldn't like it if Muslims got laws passed that required women to cover their heads in public, Hindus got cow slaughter banned, or Jews got a law passed banning shops from opening on Saturday? 

This only seems to be the issue with Christianity and Islam. You never hear about Buddhists campaigning to have booze made illegal, or orthodox Jews calling for a ban on marriage between Jews and non-Jews, so why do Christians do this? Most people realize that other people have different religions and you shouldn't try and force your values on them.",Christianity,t3_djz5fx
"A thought on Adam &amp; Eve... These are some points that were brought up at my bible study recently and I was wondering what you all thought...Possibility #1: That Adam &amp; Eve is a symbolic representation of the very long evolution of man, the Catholic Church has recognized evolution since the 50s and have been desperate to quantify God and science for way longer than that. They have been educating priests in the sciences for a long time hoping to find a clear link with God and science. [Here's the wiki on the Church and evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_and_the_Catholic_Church#Pope_Benedict_XVI) and what was said which is pretty amazing as an official stance 

&gt; According to the widely accepted scientific account, the universe erupted 15 billion years ago in an explosion called the 'Big Bang' and has been expanding and cooling ever since. Later there gradually emerged the conditions necessary for the formation of atoms, still later the condensation of galaxies and stars, and about 10 billion years later the formation of planets. In our own solar system and on earth (formed about 4.5 billion years ago), the conditions have been favorable to the emergence of life. While there is little consensus among scientists about how the origin of this first microscopic life is to be explained, there is general agreement among them that the first organism dwelt on this planet about 3.5–4 billion years ago. Since it has been demonstrated that all living organisms on earth are genetically related, it is virtually certain that all living organisms have descended from this first organism. Converging evidence from many studies in the physical and biological sciences furnishes mounting support for some theory of evolution to account for the development and diversification of life on earth, while controversy continues over the pace and mechanisms of evolution. 

Possibility #2: That Adam &amp; Eve were placed here by God and it happened literally like it says in the Bible, BUT the eating of the forbidden fruit had nothing to do with food and eating but was Eve having sexual relations with an earthly being (early human) and she became pregnant and this is why we all have the possibility of evil, because that child's dna is in us all...It makes way more sense to me that it was sex, but I believe that Adam &amp; Eve is a symbolic representation of our evolution all the way back to the single cell that first sprung to life billions of years ago, now that's quite a family tree and I find it so glorious and WAY more amazing than the 'seven days' creation story.",Christianity,t3_djzwgv

I'm broken... 

I suffer from CPTSD from combat but I'm also a very strong Christian and in tune with Christ. I'm just flat out heartbroken. But I feel like a failure. The Christ in me is strong but my flesh is failing...

I have this gift God gave me to help people and preach His word through compassion and application. 

These people ask for help and I give it to them... and they are astonished at how well my advice is or the way I speak to them. They ask me how I am able to do this and I tell them that God gave me this gift and they are immediately turned off. I bring them back to their best and they don't want the source.

I want to give up but I don't think God will let me. 😭 This is becoming a curse and I just don't know what to do anymore. I show people the unconditional love they really need and they don't want where it comes from... Why? Why do people hate God? Why do people hate Christians?

"The big difference between Muslims and Christians in the West every secularist needs to know It is no secret that most secularists come from environments where Western Christianity is the dominant  religion. Thus, for a lot of these people, Islam might be a religion that they do  not understand. Study after study shows that Christianity in the Western  World is generally decreasing at an unusually fast rate. The religion  replacing it is Islam. Many secularists are not used to dealing with Muslim apologists and Muslims infringing on State Church separation.

I  think it is appropriate for me to tell you what I think is the biggest  difference between Western Muslims and Western Christians.

Now,  I know what you are already thinking, you think that I am going to say  how Islam teaches people to kill others... but actually, not at all. I  am not going to say that. Neither am I about to say that Muslims are  less civilized or that their prophet was evil. Here is what I think is  the biggest difference between them: Muslims actually take their  religion seriously.

What  everyone reading this has to understand, is that people who call  themselves ""Christian"" or ""Anglican"" or ""Catholic"" (in the West) do not  all mean the same thing. Sure, there are devout Catholics, there are  serious Anglicans, but often, people identifying as ""Anglican"" etc  really are denoting their cultural affiliations or the religion they  grew up with. They might believe in a vague ""God"", but they do not  actually take their religion seriously.

Here  are some examples: In USA, Pew research center found out that of those  who identify as Catholic, 70% do not believe in  transubstantiation. What is arguably more shocking, is that an estimated  50% of US Catholics do not even know what their religion teaches about  this subject. The Eucharist is central to Catholic worship. It is the  biggest reason that Catholics get up on in the morning on Sunday's and  HALF OF THEM in United States do not even know that the Church teaches  that the consecrated host is not a symbol of Christ's body. Now, an  estimated 76% of US Catholics do not believe what the Church teaches  about birth control, 59% want women priests and 46% want gay marriage  recognized in Churches. In Ireland, Irish ""Catholics"" voted against  their own Church in overwhelming numbers twice (on gay marriage and  abortion).

Secularists have to  understand that Western Muslims, in general, take their religion very  seriously. I highly doubt that if there was a survey of US Muslims, 50%  would not know what Islam teaches on the divinity of Jesus. I highly  doubt that 59% of Sunni Muslims in UK would support gay marriage.

Xenophobia  is bad. We should not encourage it. But secularists have to be informed  about the religion that is replacing Christianity in the West.",Christianity,t3_dk5yng
"I feel abandoned by God and weakened on my faith. I know this may sound really silly, but I hope you have some comprehension for the magnitude this situation has on my life right now. 

Even though I've been an atheist for some years (actually just rebelled with The Lord, but that's what I would tell myself at the time), I've always had a good christian upbringing and my mother would always tell me I had a prophetic call on my life as a professional and a family man. Although this would continue to be reassured to me, I've never seen this come to fruition and, although I'm 20 right now, I dont feel secure about my future academic success, and to make things worst, my parents are growing more and more impatient by the day, mainly because my father is the one sustaining my family and hes already an elderly man who fears he might pass away without leaving us in a secure situation. 

And, to top things off, I've been assured I would soon find the woman from my city I would call wife, but time has passed and I've heard from my sister we're probably moving with her, since she got a job in another location. Also, the girl I would swear was the one I was being talked about just didnt correspond and now those last short days left in my current location  will pass with apparently another promise not accomplished.

(I know this is sounding really strange but my family is of Pentecostal Evangelicals and we take the gifts of prophecy really seriously : this message was given from a very reputable pastor and preacher who even I would put my hand on a fire for.)

"Any Christians in Ireland? I need some advice... Hello Reddit! I am an American expat who just moved to Dublin, a month ago. I am also a Protestant Christian. I recently moved in with four other women, also expats, and one of them is Indian. She’s lived here for a while and is getting her masters here, and she knows a lot of Irish people.


Anyway, I was talking to her about making new friends, and I casually mentioned I hoped to join a Protestant church. She immediately was like “good luck with that” and told me that everyone in Ireland who goes to church is either *super* weird, or really old. She said that every normal person in Ireland thought church was dumb. I was really hurt by that, and it made me feel like some kind of freak.

"Need some guidance on strange signs and reoccurring numbers Would really like to chat with someone who is aware of numerolgy and how it plays into Biblical theology. I have a reoccurring number that’s almost..haunting? me and has been for a few years. It comes up mostly when I’m conflicted abt my relationship which is also something that’s become a dark spot on my spirit. Just feeling very confused. 

Are the strange signs from God meant to be obvious? Like, if they come from God you know vs. something darker? Ive started to feel anxious and uncomfortable with these reoccurring numbers - initially I downplayed how constantly I saw them - loke a funny joke but maybe I was looking for them. But now, years later it’s too much. They come forward when I’m in this confused, indecisive state of mind and it’s consistent. If I look at the clock - 33 or 44. My change due, .33 or .44. Time to arrival on my GPS without fail is always the hour at :33 or :44. It’s often, just constantly often. 

How do I know when God is revealing Himself to me vs when I’m being tempted or led into darkness?

"Only Christianity emphasizes the value of Jesus’ blood to save mankind. Hence, Salvation from God’s Judgement can only be through Christianity After the Flood of Noah, God gave the first Law outside of Eden, to Noah.

**""But you must not eat meat with blood in it because that is its life. For sure, I will take the life of every animal and every person for taking a life. I will punish every man’s brother for taking the life of man. Whoever takes the life of a man will have his life taken. For God made man to be like Him."" - Genesis 9:4-6 New Life Version**

The prohibition against eating blood – is charged against all humanity – even though it was given to Noah; he being the progenitor of all of us. Obviously, all the races today do not take this Law seriously. People eat blood - as and when they please. Still, God promises that he will “ask back” or make an accounting for all the blood uses and abuses on the earth.

But far more serious is the promised retribution for the spilling of human blood – the Bible’s synonym for murder. We will all be held collectively accountable if this Law is ever enforced. Why? Because God holds us all responsible for the welfare of our fellow human being; we are ""our brother's keeper"" - **Genesis 4:9**

If the Law on Blood is enforced, it will result in God wiping out humanity, because we will all be “guilty by association.” He will kill men, women and children – as the compensation for all the men, women and children ever killed. There is no qualification in Genesis 9:4-6 for special cases; it’s a blanket promise for what He will do.

This is awfully brutal; if this is really going to happen. It would be – if there is no get-out-clause. What is the get-out-clause? It’s Jesus’ own blood that answers for our own individual accountability to the collective blood-guilt of mankind. By exercising faith in the blood of Christ – we are acquitted from penalty of the Law on Blood.

"Question from a curious Muslim So I was thinking today about sin against others and Islam view of it. And it sparked my curiosity about what a Christians perspective of it is.

In Islam we basically believe this from the bible.

Who will render to every man according to his deeds: (romans 2:6)

The person who sins will die. The son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son's iniquity; the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked will be upon himself. 
(Ezekiel 18:20)

No man can by any means redeem his brother Or give to God a ransom for him. (Psalms 49:7)

And fear a Day when no soul will suffice for another soul at all, and no compensation will be accepted from it, nor will any intercession benefit it, nor will they be aided.(al-Baqarah 123)

“And no bearer of burdens shall bear another’s burden”[Faatir 35:18]

So basically to get to the point

One of the names of Allah (swt) is al-adl meaning: The Equitable,  The Impartial,  The Just

So meaning Allah is Just, so while Allah forgives the sins of his servants as in the Quran 

“It is He Who accepts repentence from His servants and pardons evil acts and knows what they do.” (Surat Ash-Shura, 25)

“Any disaster that strikes you is through what your own hands have earned and He pardons much.”(Surat Ash-Shura, 30)

Allah says: “Say: O my Servants who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah: for Allah forgives all sins: for He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.” [Sûrah al-Zumar: 53]

We believe that if we wrong a person we have to seek forgiveness from him 

So our belief is basically what is written below

Abu Huraira reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Do you know who is bankrupt?” They said, “The one without money or goods is bankrupt.” The Prophet said, “Verily, the bankrupt of my nation are those who come on the Day of Resurrection with prayers, fasting, and charity, but also with insults, slander, consuming wealth, shedding blood, and beating others. The oppressed will each be given from his good deeds. If his good deeds run out before justice is fulfilled, then their sins will be cast upon him and he will be thrown into the Hellfire.”

Abu Hurayrah  may  Allah  be  pleased  with  him reported that the Prophet  sallallaahu  `alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allah exalt his mention ) said: “He who has done a wrong that affects his brother's honour or anything else, let him ask his forgiveness today before the time (i.e., the Day of Resurrection) when he will have neither a Deenaar nor a Dirham. (On that Day), if he has done some good deeds, a portion equal to his wrongdoings will be subtracted from them; but if he has no good deeds, he will be burdened with the evil deeds of the one he had wronged in the same proportion.” [Al-Bukhari]

·It was narrated from Abu Dharr that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was sitting, and two sheep locked horns until one of them defeated and subdued the other. The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) smiled and someone asked him, “Why are you smiling, O Messenger of Allaah?”  He said, “It is amazing. By the One in Whose hand is my soul, their score will be settled on the Day of Resurrection.”
·“O Abu Dharr, do you know what they are fighting over?” He said, “No.” He said, “But Allaah knows and He will judge between them.” 
Al-Nawawi said in Sharh Muslim, under the hadeeth of al-tarjumah: 

And we believe this because we believe Allah is just and fair in his actions. 

These are God's messages: We convey them unto thee, setting forth the truth, since God wills no wrong to His creation. (Quran 3:108 )

So my question being, since Christians don’t believe sinning or not sinning won’t have an effect on the day of judgment. And they believe that a person believing in Christ is going to heaven because Jesus died for the sin already. What about the sins towards other people. So if you kill a person or rape a person or molest a child , something like that then if that person is baptised and still a Christian and believes in Christ until the day he dies does he go to heaven in your belief?",Christianity,t3_djriex

"My story as a Catholic I am Canadian and born into a Catholic family (on both sides). Most people in my family join the military , as a result we moved around a lot. While I was about 9 years old my family moved across the country and we stopped going to church. Not sure why we stopped, maybe it was because we frequently moved and changing churches became annoying, or maybe my family was becoming more and more irreligious. 

I went to Catholic School every year until high school (because we moved) Religion class was always my favorite because writing reflection pieces was an easy A. Sometime in junior high I became more and more agnostic. I felt like the Bible (and all religions texts) and church /mass was not a reliable source , because anyone could change how religion operates (ex: King George and the Russian tzar) 

Nonetheless, I still believed we were created in some fashion as oppsed to hardcore atheism. Throughout my late teens and early 20's I researched other religions and how they operated. I really enjoyed odinism and the gods genetic  hierarchy. I found that faith answered more questions for me then Catholicism. There was still a lot unanswered for me with odinism.

In the last year I started looking back at the Catholic faith, but with the mission to more or less have some kind of logical explanation. I think I found it: 

It's based in the trinity with a huge emphasis on the holy Spirit. So I believe God isn't one necessarily one being. Instead I believe God is some kind of invisible Mist that inhabits all of us as well as all matter. My logic behind this was all subatomic particles have a charge. These particles make up atoms and literally make up everything. Subatomic particles can go through any state of matter (solid , liquid, ect) , and do so all the time. I believe God (holy Spirit) is the charge within all particles and God can collect itself and manifest itself into a being, to occupy a being (Jesus being born from Mary and God), or to influence a being (selectively allowing humans to perform miracles). 

To take it a step further I think we can 'farm' this energy though meditation. So if we meditate can open up the body to 'absorb'​ more of the holy Spirit and 'speak' with God. I'm not claiming that if you meditate long / hard enough you can perform miracles, I think it's a healthy activity to perform. 

Meditation is great for many reasons especially with the stress and mental health epidemic that the Western world is going through. I think this maybe because we're healing ourselves with God when doing this.

My whole reason to post this is to see what others think, not to convince people to think like me! I just want to hear some opinions on the topic.",Christianity,t3_djuhcu

"Mother Mary: the great divider of Christianity This is something I have noticed during my time talking and mingling in different Christian communities: whether it be in person, discord, forums, or here. Sadly, the very topic about the mother of our Lord and Savior has become one of the most divisive topics in Christianity.

Take for instance this very subreddit. Just this week, multiple posts about Mary have been brought up which have spiraled into bitter debate and angry rhetoric. And yes, I did partake in the debates, possibly longer than I should have.

Why has this topic become such a difficult one to talk about when have ecumenical discussions? To me, it almost seems more difficult than talking about things like Baptismal regeneration or any of the 5 Solas.",Christianity,t3_djo4y0

"I’m an agnostic atheist, here with a debate question I promise I’m not here to mock you guys, as per rules, but to debate this.  Suppose the following scenario happens:

You wake up one day and see a guy (we’ll call him X) says he loves you very much.  And he says he kidnapped you to play a game he’s devised.  The object of the game is to very best person you can be, sounds like a pretty decent game.  But there’s a problem.  He’s given you a mental disorder that makes it impossible to live up to his standards.  And worse, if you don’t, he’s gonna burn you up with a flamethrower.  And you also have to tell everyone how great he is.  If anyone says X is evil, including your family, you must break off from them and endure all that suffering all because you’re in a cruel game you didn’t ask to be in.  Not only that, he tests you by allowing a maniac who just hates everybody on Earth (call him Z, this will be Satan btw) to corrupt you, lie to you, and overall add fuel to the fire when you’ve already been inflicted by X with the mental disorder.  And if you don’t do this, he’s gonna burn you.  X doesn’t forget to tell you he loves you.  How is X not evil?  How is Z not evil too?  It reminds me of Saw.

This is why agnostics and atheists are the way they are.  They read the Bible and see it as this, and it’s already difficult to interpret due to all the contradictions.  Again, I’m here to get some explanations, I really wanna know how you’d justify this.",Christianity,t3_djx77p

"I don't think it's ethical to tithe to most churches I live in a part of the United States where megachurches are abundant. I currently go to one with conflicted feelings. I love the teachings there but I don't feel good about giving my money to them. This is a church that spends millions of dollars simply on building multi-million dollar buildings in neighboring suburbs. I don't think this is what people need. I would rather spend my money towards finding cures for viruses to help people in their suffering, or even specific ministries where I know that I'm helping a specific cause and having the gospel go out. But just simply giving to a church where I have no idea where the money's actually going, whether it be to buy coffee for the new church cafe, or to support a missionary in need...I just don't know. So although I love what churches do, I just don't think it's the greatest need. Jesus is the greatest need but are multi million dollar buildings what spreads the gospel? I don't think so...I'm not saying they're entirely useless, but I would much rather spend my money in ways that will support people that are actually in need, or fund things to help people stop suffering. I've had STD scares where I've worried that I'd be infected with a virus that's incurable and have to suffer with it the rest of my life, even after repenting. Thankfully I never got anything, but I want to help people who weren't as lucky/blessed as me. So I'd rather donate to a cause like that than a church. However, I know that my church would say that's wrong and I should give all my tithe to them. What are your thoughts?

TL;DR  I would rather donate my tithe to a cause I feel passionate about, whether that be a ministry or research to help find cures for viruses, not a church that is spending millions of dollars on nice buildings. But I would feel guilty since the church I like going to would tell me that's wrong and I should give it all to them.",Christianity,t3_djwpth

"Why is lucifer the most evil thing in the universe? What specifically has he done to deserve the title? I ask because from my laymen perspective there doesent seem to be much direct mention of his evil acts. The only ones I know are the garden of eden story(which doesent actually refer directly to satan/lucifer so how can we blame the character lucifer?), and tempting jesus in the desert. Which honestly isn't that shocking of an offense. 

Btw this is NOT trolling, I find this genuinely confusing that the main villain of all creation is so rarely and vaguely spoken of. Same with the anti-christ. Seems like you would go into more depth about such an important character since we're supposed to be on the look out.

"Agnost and a Christian (Throwaway account to avoid friends finding out) I am posting this because I am in love with a Christian girl and afraid her faith and my scepticism might create a conflict further down the road in our relationship. We are only in the dating stage, but I want to take this seriously. I have already found some other threads about the subject, but couldn't find answers that helped me out. So please, hear me out on this, because your advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I am an agnost. I acknowledge that there might be more in this world than we can understand or proof by means of science, but I find it silly to drastically adept our lives to something there is no certainty about. I respect and agree with the vast majority of Christian morale.

&amp;#x200B;

She believes the bible to be the word of God. Although she says she doesn't understand everthing, she thinks the bible should be taken as literal as possible. According to her, the only  way into heaven is by believing in Jesus without doubt and with your whole heart. She isn't certain about this, but fears that all other souls are doomed.

&amp;#x200B;

I am okay with the no-sex-before-marriage part of faith she has going on (although I kind of expect her to be openminded towards other funny buisseness when we are certain that what we have going on is serious), I think I love her and that part of the relationship I'm willing to let go if she is not comfortable with it. But the thought that she is afraid that I might not be able to join my loved ones (which might include her in the very near future) in heaven hurts me. I am also afraid that she might expect me to convert, although I have made clear that the chances of that happening are extremely small. I also do not know what will happen if we decide to have children one day, will she expect them to have a strict Christian upbringing or can she live with the thought that they can find their own way with only some loose guidance?

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all these doubts, I want to make this work. I believe she does aswell. But if this is a lost cause I want to prepare myself for it to avoid a heartbreak.

"I have found the flaw in Atheism, replied to all the comments and have yet to find a good argument placed I concluded that Existence= what we know/see + what we don’t know/don’t see. That Existence= partial knowledge + partial knowledge. That, in math terms, the denominator is 2 (know + don’t know) and the numerator is what we know, equaling 1/2, and the other 1/2 being what we don’t know. Added those 2 halves together and you get 1. A whole number. All Knowledge. Existence. Then I concluded that from this, atheism is claiming one of the halves= 0. Well, if one of the halves equals 0, that wouldnt make Existence equal Existence. It’d be 1/2 (what we know/see) + 0. That just equals 1/2, instead of 1. They want visible evidence to make it equal to Existence. They are dividing 1/2 by 2 then trying to add it to the 1/2 but that equals 3/4. Not 1. But since the Bible does say faith is the evidence of the things unseen, that makes 1/2=1/2. Then we can add 1/2 (what we know/see) + 1/2 (what we don’t know/ don’t see) and that does equal 1 (Existence/All Knowledge). Am I going against Christian beliefs here or am I supporting it properly?",Christianity,t3_dk1y03

"Is it wrong for me to believe in this outlook? My faith may not be strong but I have seen evil, and I have seen good. In my opinion, based on my values, I see what is right and wrong objectively. I say in my opinion, and i do say objectively, both of these don’t compliment and agree with each other, and they aren’t synonymous...but based on my values i see what is subjective and objective in a different manner. I see what is subjective and objective based on my environment. The world is my environment. I believe atheists would agree with me on what is right and wrong. Wrong is to inflict or to receive inflicted pain, whether it is emotional or physical. Right is to give or to receive happiness and joy. These go hand and hand with good and bad(evil). 

Atheists and Theist, in my opinion, both believe in a right and wrong, and a good and bad. The only thing is who or what we point our finger to for the reason of good and bad existing. Atheists may believe over time, through millions of years, our environment is what caused us to believe in what is right and what is wrong, what is good and what is bad. Theists, or should i say Christians, believe that what is right and what is wrong, and what is good and what is bad, is the result of sin, and the result of God allowing us to have free will. I don’t agree fully with this. I believe that we have a will to choose but I dont believe it is free. I believe we have a will to choose, but ultimately our choice is the result of our environment. This doesn’t mean that I am an unbeliever, but it means that i like to pick and choose what I believe is right according to Scripture. 

Why do I get to pick and choose you ask? I get to pick and choose because how am i suppose to believe Scripture hasn’t been changed in the past. It has been thousands of years.... I also get to pick and choose because, just like any other book that has been written, the Bible is full of metaphors, similes, analogies,etc. This means that not every sentence in the Bible means what it says in a literal since. It means that it could mean different things to many different people, but only as long as you follow God’s summary on what is good and evil: his commandments, his laws, THE MORAL VALUES God has created for us to use and follow,...then a sentence in the Bible could mean many different things to many different people as long as your opinion of what his texts means(what it is saying) doesn’t conflict with HIS law. 

Now you would probably ask, “If that is true, then how am i suppose to believe any of of what the Bible is saying?” Well, as long as you are slightly intelligent, or have a brain that can think, you would understand that you can’t read a scripture in the Bible and make a guess that is completely irrelevant to what the topic at hand that is being discussed in the Scripture.

One of the biggest debates in christianity vs atheism is the existence of Heaven and Hell. In my opinion, I believe God has had to make the choices necessary for us to at least have the chance to follow him. Why do you think God would have to tell us that if we value a life of sin, of evil, of wrongdoing, and that if we don’t believe in Him that we would go to Hell? I believe Heaven is real, but I am still deciding as to if Hell exist, and this is why.
I believe everyone should have the opportunity to go to Heaven. Now hear me out, because I know religious people are going to be furious with me, so please stay openminded and nonjudgmental. So why do i believe this? I believe this because 1)If God loves us so much then why should we have to suffer eternal damnation in Hell? 
2)Most people who have chosen to not believe in Him really haven’t had the free will to choose him or not...because our own environment we are born in is what decides what we choose to believe. 
3)Most people who have chosen to do something sinful or something that is evil in the most extreme have had a life that they didn’t choose, or a life that has created them to be mentally unstable and mentally ill... Which is a result of the environment they were born in.
4) If God was to say we are all allowed to go to Heaven, then what would the world look like today? It would be a world full of sin, a world where everyone would do whatever they please. I know many who would say this would be an awesome place live in, but truly it wouldn’t. You would suffer from the pain of others, and others would suffer from the pain of you. There would be no order, no morals or beliefs. Only bad things would happen, there would be no GOOD, only evil. People would care less if they killed another person because their answer as to why they committed murder would be, “He is going to Heaven anyway, why does it matter?” Ultimately, if he said everyone is allowed into Heaven when they die, then people would probably kill themselves in order to go to heaven.

So... why should we blame him if He was to lie to us? Well i dont think we should blame him if He was to lie. I know i wouldn’t. He wanted us to have the choice to actually experience what he has. He has experienced sorrow, pain, betrayal, manipulation, evil,etc...but he has also experienced happiness, joy, love, sympathy and empathy. Aren’t all of these things present in this world? The result of man wanting to be like him, to have the will to choose what we want, to have the right to choose between good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and sin also has to come with everything He has been through as well...the pain and the sorrow he has experienced. God has experienced everything we have as a whole, but the thing that sets Him apart from us other than being a Supreme being and Creator is He is the only one who has resisted temptation and sin. 
In the beginning I believe God set an experiment(Creation) to see if Man could resist what we ultimately wanted. We wanted to be Him. Nobody has been worthy. So that until we die, here on earth, we shall suffer the result of what we ultimately wanted (to be like him, to experience what he was). The result of wanting to be like Him creates only sympathy for Him in the end, and it also creates an understanding that we will never be like Him because we have never succeeded in becoming Him(Someone who has created life, and resisted temptation). We have created life here on Earth, but we have never resisted sin and temptation like he has on earth. This goes to my next point...

So many people may ask, “If God knows everything, why would he created the devil to tempt us to make us sin?” Well...Because he already knew Man would want to be like Him. I dont believe the Devil created sin, and I dont believe Man created sin. I believe God created the devil to create sin to tempt Man so we could understand and sympathize with Him through what we experience on Earth. If we were created in His image don’t you think that also means everything He is we are. And by “everything He is we are,” i mean everything Has experienced, and  the right to choose between good and bad.” He set us up to want to be like Him... only to show that we could never be like Him because he is Supreme and because He is one of a kind. How other way could God show He is Supreme other than showing us that we can never accomplish what he has? And how other way could God create Man to show empathy and to sympathize with Him then to show us everything he has been through? This should create love for Him because God has been through it all and yet he still loves us. Man could never face what he has faced and still choose to love those who have done us wrong. This is what he wants of us, but it will never happen because we aren’t as special as he is.

As a man who has partial faith and who is still deciding on what he believes. I believe these things that I say are only what I believe. I believe all of this makes the most since to me, and that is why I choose Christianity over every other religion. I am not saying this is what you should choose to believe, and I don’t want to misconstrue the Word of God...because it is highly probably that I could be wrong, but if my desire is to believe in God, and if I have faith that he is real, then why not choose to believe in something like this that doesn’t change my love for Him at all...but only makes me understand and love Him more...",Christianity,t3_djuwd7

"I can't date Christian women anymore (Long) Hey guys so I'm using an alt account so this post won't appear on my profile, but in the event that the person I don't want reading this (my girlfriend) finds this, she's going to know immediately that it's me so I might as well tell the rest of you who I don't mind knowing that I'm /u/friendlycommie. And in the hopefully unlikely event you are my girlfriend reading this... I think you already know all of this. I hope it doesn't upset you. I love you.

Anyway... so there aren't that many Christians my age in the UK. The result of which being that even since becoming a Christian I have dated both non-Christians and Christians in my time. But I don't think I can date Christians anymore... for one simple reason. See with non-Christians the relationship consistently goes like this. We date, problems start to emerge, we fight a bit, we might try and change some stuff, realise it's not working, and break up.

Now by contrast here's what happens every time I have dated a Christian woman: we meet, we talk, we get along, we have a few very minor disagreements throughout the relationship, but nothing serious and we usually work things out. And things stay like that consistently... we generally get along, we have the odd minor argument, we work it out. Pretty much exactly what you'd expect out of any relationship. And then one day I get a message saying, ""Hey... I've been thinking, and I don't think we're right for each other. So long.""

And the thing is it's getting worse every time:

The first Christian woman I dated was an Iraqi. And obviously the same thing as above happened. We clicked quite quickly, we started making very easy conversation, a few fights here and there, but nothing major (for an example, one of our fights was me joking that chiropractors paralyse people by snapping their backs, and she didn't like that because she was training to be a chiropractor. So nothing major.) And then one day she didn't respond for for a couple of days to my messages, so I asked what was up, and she just said, ""Hey sorry I shouldn't have just ignored you but I've been really thinking about myself and God and how things are going and I just don't think things are going to work out."" In total we had dated for a couple of months.

Next Christian woman I dated things went the same... And then she didn't message me for a couple of days, so I asked what was up. She said she'd been really busy thinking about stuff and her future, so I said it's fine, she'll just owe me a nice long convo that night, but then she said, ""No you don't understand... things have been busy like... I've been thinking about things, and I don't think we're working out."" Thing is, this came so out of nowhere that she had to break up with me twice because the first time I didn't even realise she was breaking up with me. We'd dated for just shy of a year.

And now we get to my current girlfriend. We've been dating for a year and a half at this point. And things have gone pretty much the same, but better. We get along even more, when we do fight we work things out super quickly. She's super understanding so the normal miscommunications that can lead to fights don't here. This has all been long distance though, and she really wanted to meet up. My flight anxiety has made me hesitant to bite the bullet, and I've been in the process of getting it so after a year and a half of long distance without having physically seen each other, I'm finally going to see her in early-Mid January. And then yesterday she said, ""Hey... I don't want to talk to you for all of this weekend. From Friday to Monday, I want to have that time completely alone. Because I really need to think about God and what I want and need.""

So at this point it seems so unlikely that on Monday I'm going to get a message saying, ""Hey, I thought about God and what I want and what I need and yeah turns out I'm really happy with our relationship and want it to continue."" I keep trying to make that work in my head, but it just seems like such a ridiculously unlikely outcome. Because I've been through this twice before. And I feel like such an idiot. I feel like shit.

And I also sort of think to myself... where do I go from here? I don't think I can date anybody worse than her, because that would tear me apart, knowing that I was broken up with by a woman I prefer over my current girlfriend. If I'm going to find somebody else, they'd have to be just as perfect. But if they're a Christian, then what's going to happen? Maybe we'll date a bit longer. Maybe she'll even become my fiance. But then at the altar I'll get that message, ""Oh hi! I've been thinking about us and my spiritual growth as a Christian and really working things out with God and yeah I think this isn't working out.""

Now again... what bothers me about this is how it comes out of nowhere. Yes we have arguments, but these arguments are minor and if anything our ability to grow from those arguments is something to be envied. And this isn't just a woman thing: it's a Christian woman thing. I've dated lots of non-Christian women and every single time I can say that I saw the end of our relationship coming. By contrast I've dated Christian women and every single time I didn't see it coming. In every case, if you were to ask me the day before we broke up if I could see us getting married, I'd have said ""Yeah I could see that"" regarding the woman I dated for the least time and ""Yes, definitely, that's fully my intention"" in regard to the woman I am currently dating.

Now you might say: ""Well maybe it's something about you that makes Christian women feel uncomfortable regarding their faith."" There are two issues here: firstly... I'm really strong in my faith. I read the Bible every night. I pray regularly. I'll often actually try to make theological and spiritual discussions apart of the regular conversation. But secondly, when I've dated Christian girls, we have argued, and the nature of our relationship in relation to our faith has never been something we've argued about--at least not consistently. So you're sort of stuck with the same problem... If somebody is going to break up with me because they think they aren't growing in the faith with me, and they give no prior indication that's how they feel, then I'm still left being broken up with seemingly out of nowhere.

Right now my only hope is that my girlfriend has a habit about making things sound worse than they are. I've been afraid she was going to break up with me before (mostly because of my experience with sudden break ups from Christian women) and she never has. So maybe despite this sounding incredibly ominous... she'll come out the other end with some meaningful and profitable thoughts about our relationship, but still willing to work on any issues together. That's what I pray for... but I dare not hope for it, because I'm afraid of how much having hope could destroy me if things go badly.

So if we break up... I don't know if I can do it. I don't know if I can date another Christian. Which is insane because I am very radical in my Christianity. My Christianity is something very significant to me. However, when I say that next time I might get broken up with on the aisle... I'm not really kidding. First time it was a couple of months going swimmingly, then a break up. Second time it was just under a year going swimmingly, then a break up. This time it's a year and a half going swimmingly... and it's hard not to imagine this will end in a break up too. I don't want it to... If you would have asked me yesterday I'd have said I wanted to marry this woman. But... :(

So maybe I'll date an atheist... or a Muslim. And sure maybe things won't work out, but at least I'll know they aren't working out and we'll be able to mutually end things. As opposed to what I fully expect if I were to date a Christian again, which is things going absolutely swimmingly, and then a break up totally out of nowhere. In fact even if I wanted to date a Christian, I feel like if I did, the anxiety that I now have about it would actually make the relationship impossible. She could literally be sending a message about how much she loves me and how great we are together, and I'd be fully justified in thinking, ""She might break up with me tomorrow.""

So yeah... pray for my relationship guys, please. Pray that things work out. Because if they don't, I'll probably be posting again on Monday asking for you to pray for my future as a Christian, because if I can't share this life with a fellow Christian, I don't know how that's going to affect my walk with God.",Christianity,t3_djkmss

"Making the Good News Great Again: A Reflection on That All Shall Be Saved *First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.* (1 Timothy 2:1-4)

I have recently finished David Bentley Hart's newest book, *That All Shall be Saved*, and would like to share some of my impressions both on the basic arguments presented in the book, but primarily on how I think it presents a particularly powerful depection of the Gospel and God’s victory over evil, sin, and death. I will, against DBH's protestations, present my evaluation of this book against the classic pillars of persuasion: logos, pathos, and ethos.

## *Logos*

I will include only the briefest highlights of DBH’s arguments here, since this post isn’t meant to recapitulate the book. I find the arguments presented compelling, and I hope this post might encourage others to investigate them. I also hope that those who do not find the arguments compelling will not begin and end with critiques of personality, nor with proof texting naked assertions. I will cover under *ethos* why I, unfortunately, do not think this appeal will be heeded.

DBH presents four primary arguments for universal reconciliation. While DBH does assert the *eventual* salvation of all, he does not reject the real existence of a deeply unpleasant hell to which no one should desire to go. This, perhaps, is one of the key takeaways: hell does not need to be eternal in order to be hell. Would you want to even temporarily be in any of the places Christ describes as an abode of the wicked? If aiming towards the eternal bliss of God is not sufficient motivation to enact love for God and neighbor, then the rod is still present.

### First Meditation: Who is God? The Moral Meaning of Creatio ex Nihilo

According to Hart, since God is both the first and final cause of creation, no matter what may happen in the realm of secondary causes to wander away from God, creation will eventually wander back to God. God is in a very real sense responsible, if only by allowance, for all that takes place. In DBHs view, it seems that the return to God is inevitable but not irresistible.

&gt;...the moral destiny of creation and the moral nature of God are absolutely inseparable. As the transcendent Good beyond all beings, God is also the transcendental end that makes every single action of any rational nature possible. Moreover, the end toward which he acts must be his own goodness; for he is himself the beginning and end of all things. This is not to deny that, in addition to the “primary causality” of God’s act of creation, there are innumerable forms of “secondary causality” operative within the created order; but none of these can exceed or escape the one end toward which the first cause directs all things. And this eternal teleology that ultimately governs every action in creation, viewed from the vantage of history, takes the form of a cosmic eschatology. Seen as an eternal act of God, creation’s term is the divine nature for which all things were made; seen from within the orientation of time, its term is the “final judgment” that brings all things to their true conclusion.


#### Second Meditation: What is Judgement? A Reflection on Biblical Eschatology

It is in this meditation that DBH lays out what he believes to be the scriptural basis for universal reconciliation. He argues that “eternal” is a poor interpretation of the word “aion,” and that every verse generally interpreted as indicating a eternal hell can be understood as either not commenting on “duration” or as affirming the eventual escape, rescue, or purgation. He further weighs those verses that are most typically interpreted as depicting an eternal hell passages that are considerably more expansive in their view of salvation.

&gt;To me it is surpassingly strange that, down the centuries, most Christians have come to believe that one class of claims—all of which are allegorical, pictorial, vague, and metaphorical in form—must be regarded as providing the “literal” content of the New Testament’s teaching regarding the world to come, while another class—all of which are invariably straightforward doctrinal statements—must be regarded as mere hyperbole. It is one of the great mysteries of Christian history (or perhaps of a certain kind of religious psychopathology). And it is certainly curious also that so many Christians are able to recognize that the language of scripture is full of metaphor, on just about every page, and yet fail to notice that, when it comes to descriptions of the world to come, there are no non-metaphorical images at all. Why precisely this should be I cannot say. We can see that the ovens are metaphors, and the wheat and the chaff, and the angelic harvest, and the barred doors, and the debtors’ prisons; so why do we not also recognize that the deathless worm and the inextinguishable fire and all other such images (none of which, again, means quite what the infernalist imagines) are themselves mere figural devices within the embrace of an extravagant apocalyptic imagery that, in itself, has no strictly literal elements? How did some images become mere images in the general Christian imagination while others became exact documentary portraits of some final reality?

### Third Meditation: What is a Person? A Reflection on the Divine Image

In this meditation, DBH argues that the human person, and human nature for that matter, can be fulfilled only in the salvation of the whole plenitude of mankind. Any eternally suffering soul would mar the beatitude of the blessed, and be a region of evil unconquered by God. Any annihilation is argued to constitute the erasure of not only the soul annihilated, but also of all persons connected to that annihilated soul, and so even a single annihilated soul would constitute the erasure of all persons. 

&gt;...either all persons must be saved, or none can be. According to the traditional picture of a dual eternity, a final division of the saved and the damned (whether the latter be tortured forever or merely forever annihilated), God could in fact save no persons at all. He could of course erase each of the elect as whoever they once were, by shattering their memories and attachments like the gates of hell, and then raise up some other being in each of their places, thus converting the will of each into an idiot bliss stripped of the loves that made him or her this person—associations and attachments and pity and tenderness and all the rest. But persons, it seems, could not be saved; they could only be damned.

&gt;MacDonald’s words, I think, indicate the only true sense in which the sufferings of the damned could contribute to the beatitude of the saved: by awakening again and yet again a truly substitutionary love within souls whose whole being and delight consists precisely in such love. And, really, if there is any true continuity between the charity we are called to cultivate in this life and the transfiguring love that supposedly unites us to God, then surely there can be no brake upon our desire to include those still outside the company of the redeemed. Such love could find its complete joy only in the joy of completion. Such love, in fact, would not even be able to distinguish between this corporate desire for the salvation of all and the individual soul’s longing for its own salvation. I am not I in myself alone, but only in all others. If, then, anyone is in hell, I too am partly in hell. Happily, however, if the Christian story is true, that love cannot now end in failure or tragedy. The descent into those depths—where we seek out and find those who are lost, and find our own salvation in so doing—is not a lonely act of spiritual heroism, or a futile rebellion of our finite wills against a merciless eternity. For the whole substance of Christian faith is the conviction that another has already and decisively gone down into that abyss for us, to set all the prisoners free, even from the chains of their own hatred and despair; and hence the love that has made all of us who we are, and that will continue throughout eternity to do so, cannot ultimately be rejected by anyone.

### Fourth Meditation: What is Freedom? A Reflection on the Rational Will

In this meditation, DBH rejects libertarian freedom in favor of “intellectualist” freedom: “Freedom is a being’s power to flourish as what it naturally is, to become ever more fully what it is.” He argues that under this model of freedom no one can possibly be said in this life, marred as it is by ignorance and evil, to freely reject God. We can incur some culpability, but certainly not perfect or infinite culpability in any rejection of God. This constitutes one reason hell must be finite, namely, any departure from God is necessarily finite. Further, upon the removal of ignorance, any rational creation will move inevitably towards the Good, that is, God. The purgation of hell must eventually be completed because hell is God revealed, and God revealed is the Good towards which we all naturally desire to move.

While this text is actually from the first meditation, I think it is representative of his thought on freedom of will

&gt;...to me it seems impossible to speak of freedom in any meaningful sense at all unless one begins from the assumption that, for a rational spirit, to see the good and know it truly is to desire it insatiably and to obey it unconditionally, while not to desire it is not to have known it truly, and so never to have been free to choose it.

## *Pathos*

One point DBH makes over and over again is that the Gospel is good news of the victory of God over evil, sin, and death. This should come as no surprise to any Orthodox person. Where DBH departs from many is telling the story, using St. Gregory of Nyssa as his guide, such that there is no residual evil left over. No unending hell, no rational creature left in agony for eternity. God’s victory is total. This, to me, is a most moving way to understand the Gospel as unrelenting good news. God has come to recall all of us, no matter what lengths he must go to, and he will rescue every sheep. The whole plenitude of mankind will be rescued and so God will be “all in all.”

&gt;For the earliest Christians, the story of salvation was entirely one of rescue, all the way through: the epic of God descending into the depths of human estrangement to release his creatures from bondage to death, penetrating even into the heart of hades to set the captives free and recall his prodigal children and restore a broken creation. The sacrifice of Christ was not a “ransom” paid to the Father, but rather the “manumission fee” (λύτρον, lytron) given to purchase the release of slaves held in bondage in death’s household.

&gt;...the only Christian narrative of salvation that to me seems coherent is the one that the earliest church derived so directly from scripture: a relentless tale of rescue, conducted by a God who requires no tribute to win his forgiveness or love.

&gt;For [Gregory of Nyssa], therefore, the narrative of salvation in the New Testament was an epic tale of rescue and conquest, the overthrow of all evil—natural evil, moral evil, the evil of the hell we bring upon ourselves—and the invasion of death’s kingdom by the shattering divinity of Christ. It is a tale that can end only in perfect victory and perfect peace.

For reasons that do not make sense to me, some will interpret a hell that ends as meaning we can all kick back and relax. If you are that kind of person, I point out again: hell is real, and DBH does not deny this. Purgation is not pleasant. If we can get it over with here for the most part, it is in our best interest to do so. If the hells we find ourselves in here are so awful, we should not expect to purgatorial fire to be any less scalding, and indeed, the images we are given in scripture make all but the most extreme chastisements of this world pale next to the fires of God.

&gt;Maybe there are a great many among us who can be convinced to be good only through the threat of endless torture...Even so much as hint that the “purifying flames” of the Age to come will at the last be extinguished, and perhaps a good number of us will begin to think like the mafioso who refuses to turn state’s evidence because he is sure that he can “do the time.” Bravado is, after all, the chief virtue of the incorrigibly stupid. I hope that this is not really the case...

## *Ethos*

Regarding ethos DBH falls on his face so hard in this category it very nearly destroys his whole body of work as a route to persuasion. He is arrogant and an asshole. When highlighting the book, I found that what I was really doing was editing out the name calling. To a large extent I was able to “read around” this issue because I am not the one being targeted by DBH, and because I already despise Calvinism in the same degree as DBH does, and I think everyone else should too. However, his assholery extends far beyond just devotees (witting or unwitting) of Calvin and to pretty much anyone who would dare to disagree with DBH. Despite DBH presenting a coherent case this failing is likely to ensure that detractors never actually read the argument, and therefore, will also be unable to engage the argument. We will, instead, be left in a sea of emotivism.

I contrast this persuasive failing to the Church’s pillars of rhetoric on ethos: the saints. These are people that, regardless of other persuasive defects, are nevertheless absolute paragons of ethos. These are folks who, even when their arguments are flawed or there's disagreement between them, those intellectual flaws clearly did not hamper their sanctity. For better or worse, they get listened to because clearly whatever they experienced wrought holiness, flaws and all. We have very few witnesses of universal reconciliation leading to sanctity (though, of course, it has happened), and forgive me for saying it, but DBH almost certainly is not one of those examples. 

## Concluding Remarks

While I think this vision of universal reconciliation makes the good news great again, we doubtless need examples of it inspiring holiness in those that adhere to it. The gap in ethos left by DBH is wide indeed, and the distance in time between us and those who may fill it is long and they arguably have simply been passed over by the Church. I hope some of those who are affected by DBH’s view can forge a path forward in the increased brilliance of the Light of Christ that I believe DBH presents in his theology, but unfortunately diminishes with his rhetoric.",Christianity,t3_djmbkd

They both hate God.



Differences: Lucifers (The series version) he was cast down to rule over Hell for eternity, he retires to the face of the Earth essentially leaving The underworld without a ruler, he seems to grow fond of humans, especially a woman detective named Chloe.  In this version, He and the other angels are considered not just God's creation but his children, as such when talking to or about him, he's always saying Dad, or father. 

There has been no mention of Jesus Christ but that doesn't necessarily mean anything, he probably exists in that Universe, it just simply means he hasn't been mentioned. And if that were the case, then Jesus and Lucifer and the rest of the angels could be considered brothers.

He doesn't see himself as evil. ""I'm not evil, I punish evil""

He does not lie

In this version,rather than an entity of pure raw malice and evil, he's simply a Rebel that went against his father's wishes to get back at him for throwing him out of heaven





Christianity version: Devil was cast down to Hell as punishment, he doesn't rule hell not will he ever, hell is his ultimate destination, he wants everyone to suffer the same fate as he will. He hated God and his creation. He is considered the Father of lies.

God is merely his creator, not his father.

"St. Teresa of Avila’s Haunting Vision Of Hell &amp;#x200B;

[St Teresa of Avila and Her Vision of Hell](https://i.redd.it/ia9ws9bwjbt31.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

St. Teresa of Avila’s haunting vision of Hell

The vision reminded her of the mercy of God and how he spared her this horrendous fate.

While St. Teresa of Avila is known to have experienced some of the most ecstatic experiences of God’s presence ever recorded, she also received visions of the opposite.

Teresa writes in her autobiography about a frightening vision she had of Hell and how it haunted her the rest of her life. When writing the vision down she experienced the same bone-chilling feelings run throughout her body.

I found myself, as I thought, plunged right into Hell. I realized that it was the Lord’s will that I should see the place which the devils had prepared for me there and which I had merited for my sins. This happened in the briefest space of time, but, even if I were to live for many years, I believe it would be impossible for me to forget it. The entrance, I thought, resembled a very long, narrow passage, like a furnace, very low, dark and closely confined; the ground seemed to be full of water which looked like filthy, evil-smelling mud, and in it were many wicked-looking reptiles. At the end there was a hollow place scooped out of a wall, like a cupboard, and it was here that I found myself in close confinement. But the sight of all this was pleasant by comparison with what I felt there … My feelings, I think, could not possibly be exaggerated, nor can anyone understand them. I felt a fire within my soul the nature of which I am utterly incapable of describing … I had been put in this place which looked like a hole in the wall, and those very walls, so terrible to the sight, bore down upon me and completely stifled me. There was no light and everything was in the blackest darkness.

It was a terrifying experience, but she fully understood why God allowed her to see first-hand the torments of Hell.

\[T\]his vision was one of the most signal favors which the Lord has bestowed upon me: it has been of the greatest benefit to me, both in taking from me all fear of the tribulations and disappointments of this life and also in strengthening me to suffer them and to give thanks to the Lord, Who, as I now believe, has delivered me from such terrible and never-ending torments.

She understood that if she hadn’t turned away from vice and embrace a life of virtue, this would have been her fate. Teresa was grateful to God for the many graces she received and for his mercy in sparing her such torment.

Furthermore, this vision moved St. Teresa to experience great sadness over those people who were drawing near to that destination, through their deliberate choices.

It also inspired me with fervent impulses for the good of souls: for I really believe that, to deliver a single one of them from such dreadful tortures, I would willingly die many deaths. After all, if we see anyone on earth who is especially dear to us suffering great trial or pain, our very nature seems to move us to compassion, and if his sufferings are severe they oppress us too.

Instead of experiencing satisfaction at the justice of those souls being eternally damned, she wanted to save them, offering herself as a living sacrifice.

Hell is a very real place, and while it shouldn’t be our only reason for choosing virtue over vice, it is a good starting point and should lead us to a life united to God. Our choices matter, and the good news is that we can change our lives, no matter how far we have gone down the wrong path.",Christianity,t3_djp8me
"A purely speculative theory. My theory is this: The so-called 'gods' of pagan myth are in fact spiritual beings(think angels, divine council, cherubim).

Jesus's sacrifice had an impact on every corner of creation, every universe, every dimension, and every world. These 'gods' or 'spirit-beings' were now split between those who served God and those who serve the devil.

Note: I am not saying that these beings are at all deserving of worship. Actually, like the angels, they are inferior to mankind.",Christianity,t3_djs6x1

I don't have a logical explanation as to why that is, but I've had kind of a feeling of panic and guilt about not having done so. As such, I've been strongly considering having them baptized in a nearby United Church. We aren't members and while I am still much more drawn to Orthodox Christianity,  I find the theology and progressiveness of the United Church to align quite well with my own beliefs while also being a church that is physically accessible to me and my child to attend.

"Advice request: Unbelieving parents are coming to church. My parents are staunch atheist scientists. I was raised as an atheist and you could probably characterize them as ‘scoffers’. I came to the faith ~ a year ago, and the family is having a hard time with it. I think they’re scared I’m joining a cult. My therapist is even weary and says they’re worried I’m gonna become a ‘Jesus Freak’. Ouch.
Aside from not embracing faith, they have been wonderful parents. I know that they love me and support what makes me happy, but I feel judged because I’ve heard what they really think about believers when I was growing up.

"I need help please. I can't tell if I'm having a spiritual battle or if I am insane I dont know where to start with this but here goes:

Today I felt like God was speaking to me through outside words. It actually caused me to realize I have been living a life of sin and made me run desperately to the Bible to be saved and I felt anew. But then I was trying to pray and I got a voice that said I must confess to my boyfriend that I sexted with a guy on the internet and there was a voice saying ""obey God"" and it basically said this was the first step and I had to do what God said even though I was scared. Only thing was when I told my boyfriend that I sexted with this guy I started making up this story that we had a connection and It escalated into sexting. I guess it sounded more innocent? So I basically felt I had to lie about my motivations. I don't know why I made up this lie, the real reason was I was sexually frustrated and if I had just told him the truth about this it would have all been ok. He forgave me right away but he said there must be something wrong with our relationship for me to emotionally cheat. Even though I wasn't actually emotionally cheating I was just sexually frustrated because my boyfriend lives far away.

Basically I thought it was gods voice telling me I had to confess but then I lied about my motivations and it made things worse. Making me think it was actually Satan's voice tricking me.

"Apologetics vs Faith Hi all, I’ve been struggling with something for a bit now and was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar, or has advice on how to help. 

I was raised IFB—more fringe than that in practice, (doomsdayer type) but it was the type of church we attended—and was pushed away from Christianity because I thought it was the only true way to be Christian, and my experience with gender dysphoria and ultimate choice to transition was harshly criticized (and was the source of various abuses I endured from my family and the church i.e., several months of conversion therapy and corporal/psychological discipline). 

Somewhat recently, I’ve gotten into apologetics and the logical defense of Christianity. I’ve never felt a connection to Christ other than fearing Hell or feeling guilt. And honestly, the more I become convinced of a creator god and the validity of scripture, the more I feel guilty for not caring. The guilt tells me that I know the truth but choose not to obey it, ultimately betraying both God and myself...when the reality is that while I could defend Christianity with two hands tied behind my back, it all feels hypothetical. 

The best analogy I can think of is knowing that climate change is real, but being so mentally detached that I don’t care to do anything about it.

"What to tell someone of the West Mission Society Church of God There are these guys on campus that I often run into, and they are a part of the West Mission Society Church of God. If you don't know they believe that there is a mother God and that Jesus already came a second time from South Korea. Basically I have no idea what to tell them. 

Today our conversation was mainly about Genesis 1:27 where it says ""let us make man in our image"" they think ""us"" means the mother God and the father God and that 'image"" means that God the Father created male and God the mother created female because they have separate genitals. I tried telling them that ""us"" could clearly imply the Trinity (maybe I shouldn't use that example because it seems they don't really believe in that) I also said that ""image"" could just mean the general shape of a human.

If you want to know more about what they believe and there ""evidences"" just look at their west mission society Church of God website. I don't want this post to be super long.

Basically I have no idea what to tell them that they are wrong. Everything I have told them hasnt worked. I have almost come to the conclusion that it will be impossible to change their minds.

"Why do so many christians side with republican and right wing politics? Doesnt that contradict how Jesus told us to behave? So ive been doing a bit more bible study and reading, and i cant help but notice that Jesus was quite liberal. He would tell rich men to give to the poor, command people to welcome immigrants into their homes, and practice love and compassion wherever he went. We also all know about that time he went savage on the people making money in the church. This seems to heavily go against all these megachurches with rich pastors. Those pastors always made me suspicious. So if these are the stories we are told about Jesus, why dont we practice it more?

"The Straw that Broke the Camel's Back Hello, I hope you are well. The following is what had caused me to stop believing:

The last straw was when I was alone in my room as a teen, crying and feeling suicidal. I began thinking about how so many others feel the same way; tortured, isolated and cripplingly depressed, to the point that it drives people to kill themselves. I thought then: ""how could an all-loving god ever allow this to happen?"". I then began thinking about how god sends people who commit suicide to an eternity in hell, along with anyone (good or bad) who simply does not believe. That was it.

After learning more about the fallacy of Christianity, I still wasn't sure what set of beliefs I wanted to belong to (I certainly knew it wasn't one with an abrahamic god), but I really just wanted to feel included at the time. When my atheist best friend died though, it was all over for me. Grieving over his death, memories of how sound his arguments against theism in general were, it finally fell into place. I was an adamant, anti-theistic atheist from then on.

I find the natural world (biodiversity, evolution, the cosmos and everything in it, et cetera) to be far more fascinating than any fable could ever depict otherwise. Adversely, religion as a whole is harmful to societal progress, and it just might be what ultimately ends us as a species, unless enough people become awakened to it all, and enact change.

"Reflection Story: Blindly Following Man Can Lead to Losing Your Salvation One day, I was leaning against a window and browsing the web on my cell phone without much enthusiasm when suddenly a short story caught my attention. This is how the story goes: A boss was at the meal with his employees. One of the employees, who suffers a severe myopic, mistook an orange for an apple and bit into it, which provoked a lot of laughter. However, only one employee not only didn’t laugh but passed a cup of fruit juice to the man.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ehz6bduyi9t31.jpg

The next day, the boss invited his employees to have dinner again. He picked up the same orange as that employee bit the day before and took a large mouthful of it. Seeing this, all the other employees followed him to eat oranges while only the one didn’t do so who passed the fruit juice to his colleague the day before. At this moment, the boss announced that this employee would be appointed as his assistant. The reason was that, at the last dinner party, this employee was the only one who didn’t laugh at his colleague making a mistake but instead passed him the juice, and at this party, he was also the only one who didn’t blindly follow his boss.

After finishing reading the story, I was deeply stirred: In real life, many people adore and look up to those who have position and status, to the point that they often consider those people their ideals and even take their words as maxims to accept and spread. And it is sad that, when following and imitating their ideals, few of them discern whether what those people do is right, and thus lose their own opinion, stance and correct judgment on things they should have. In comparison, the employee in this story who was highly prized by the boss could stay cool-headed, always walk by reason to be himself, and not be influenced by status and power. This kind of person has been so rare as to almost never be seen. This is why this employee could stand out from his colleagues, finally win his boss’ appreciation and be promoted. Pondering this story, I couldn’t help but wonder whether there were similar phenomena of advocating power and status among us believers in God. This reminded me of what happened two thousand years ago when the Lord Jesus was working on earth …

“Crucify Him!” “Crucify Him!”

Each shout of the Jewish believers, gloomy and ferocious, seemed to be lingering in my ears. Two thousand years ago, when the Lord Jesus carried out His redemptive work in Israel, He expressed lots of truths, performed many miraculous signs and wonders, such as making the blind see and the lame walk, raising the dead and so on, and He also brought mankind rich and bountiful grace. All this indicated the authority and power of the Lord. Nevertheless, at that time, very few people could admit that the Lord Jesus was the Messiah and accept His salvation. As for most Jewish believers, after hearing and seeing the words and work of the Lord Jesus, although they marveled, they didn’t seek or investigate but instead blindly followed the chief priests, scribes and the Pharisees to resist the Lord Jesus. In their hearts, they believed that because the chief priests, scribes and the Pharisees were the religious leaders, were familiar with the Bible and well-versed in the law, had served God in the temple for years, and expended and forsook for God, their words were definitely the most authoritative and it was certainly right to listen to them. Therefore, when the Pharisees blasphemed the Lord Jesus by saying that He depended on the prince of the devils to cast out demons, and accused Him of speaking blasphemies, they didn’t bother to discern whether their words were right, but instead blindly joined with them in resisting and condemning the Lord Jesus and did not accept His words and work. So much so that when the chief priests asked Pilate to release the murderer Barabbas and crucify the Lord Jesus, they immediately agreed strongly and even proclaimed to Pilate: “Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and on our children” (Matthew 27:25). Ultimately, they followed the religious leaders, who colluded with the Roman government, to nail the Lord Jesus to the cross, committing a most heinous sin and severely offending God’s disposition. Thus, they were destined to be punished and at the same time they brought their offspring endless disasters!

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/elzichzzi9t31.jpg

From the bitter lesson of the Jews it can be seen that, if we believers blindly worship and follow man, and listen to man in everything, we’ll be easily controlled by others, and can’t take a stand based on our own judgment. Then, even though we hear the voice of God, we won’t actively seek or investigate, but instead will do things that resist God and offend God’s disposition, thus leading us to suffer perdition and to perish!

On the contrary, as for the group of people who followed the Lord Jesus in that era, such as the disciples Peter, John, Jacob and so on, what was expressed in them was completely different. While rumors had been in the air and the entire religious world was fanatically condemning the Lord Jesus, they didn’t blindly follow the religious forces to resist Him, but still remained clear-headed and could take the initiative to seek and investigate His work. In the end, through the Lord Jesus’ word and work, they recognized that He was the promised Messiah and so followed His footsteps and received the grace of His salvation.

Now, we’re in the last days, and it is also the crucial moment of welcoming the Lord’s return. The prophecy of the return of the Lord recorded in the Bible has been fulfilled. In particular, there are people openly testifying that the Lord Jesus has returned and uttered new words. In approaching such a big event, many pastors and elders in the religious world believe that it is not possible that the Lord has returned, and that any preaching that says the Lord has returned is heresy and an evil cult. They also ask the believers never to listen, look or have any contact with anyone who preaches the gospel of the Lord’s return. Facing the words of the religious leaders, different believers each have their own manifestations. Some think that the pastors and elders have served the Lord for many years, are proficient in and understand the Bible, and are more mature than us believers in life, and so whatever they say, we should listen and it is absolutely right to do so. Therefore, with regard to welcoming the Lord’s coming, we must let the pastors and elders make the decisions. There are also some people who believe that now is the very time when the Lord will return, and that if we listen to the pastors and elders and condemn any message of the coming of the Lord, won’t we be convicted if the Lord has really come? Would we still be able to welcome the Lord? But they also feel confused: If we don’t listen to the pastors and elders, wouldn’t our faith our whole lives just be in vain if we followed the wrong people? Because of this, they often toss and turn, but still can’t make a decision …

What then should we do so that we won’t make the same mistake as the Jewish believers? In reality, the Lord Jesus long ago gave revelation to us and shared with us the way to welcoming His second coming. The Lord Jesus said: “**I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He will guide you into all truth: for He shall not speak of Himself; but whatever He shall hear, that shall He speak: and He will show you things to come**” (John 16:12–13). It is prophesied in Revelation: “**He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God**” (Revelation 2:7). “**Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear My voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me**” (Revelation 3:20). This shows that when the Lord Jesus returns in the last days, He will utter more words to lead us, water and nourish us, and so the key to welcoming His coming is in learning to listen closely to God’s voice. When we hear someone bearing witness that the Lord has come back, or that the Holy Spirit is speaking to the churches, we shouldn’t be restricted by others but instead should humbly seek and investigate, and only in this way can we have the opportunity to welcome the Lord’s appearance. Actually, in the Age of Grace, the Lord Jesus’ disciples such as Peter, John and so on, practiced this way. Their success in welcoming the Lord Jesus came primarily from the fact that, after they, through the Lord Jesus’ words, recognized that He was the Messiah, and was Christ, who had authority and the truth, they stood firm to follow Him to the end and weren’t influenced by the religious leaders at all. For this reason, they were qualified to gain enlightenment from the Holy Spirit and welcomed the Messiah.

In waiting for the arrival of the Messiah, those of the Jewish faith didn’t rely on God’s words but blindly worshiped power and status, and in the end, this is what led to tragedy. They and the disciples following the Lord Jesus showed us the different endings that two very different people brought to themselves on the path of following God. So, we must have clear and sober minds to walk the path of faith, and we should not be controlled by anyone, nor should we look up to or worship any person. No matter how high someone’s status and how great someone’s power, we shouldn’t blindly emulate or follow them. Especially in the matter of investigating the true way, it’s even more important that we should take a firm stance, take the initiative to seek the truth and God’s will, and not blindly follow others. Only in this way can we at every step keep up with the footsteps of the Lamb, just as the Lord Jesus said: “**Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled**” (Matthew 5:6). “**Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God**” (Matthew 5:8).",Christianity,t3_djkog8

Alot of people brush it off because most don't believe animals have souls so no suffering actually occurs. But my point is whenever im watching nature documentaries and see how much conflict and violence is built into the system I actually find it frightening to imagine a being that builds things this way intentionally.

Believer: False. According to the bible God is Sovereign, Just and Righteous. In the biblical context He’s the ultimate justice system. He cannot act unjust or unrighteous. This is a basic bible tenet.


Skeptic: But he [insert evil.]


Believer: On what basis was [insert act] evil?


Skeptic: Everyone knows it’s wrong to [insert act].


Believer: Based on what morality standard? Nature?


In the natural mechanism, in the absence of God, there’s no objective moral standard. Nature is metal; not moral. For instance if a dominant [male lion systematically murders the offspring of another male](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZRw0IYdf3g&amp;nohtml5=False) there’s no moral law in nature that condemns him. In fact nature rewards him. 



Skeptic: How so?


Believer: Nature lives + adapts = survives. The lion is rewarded with the opportunity to propitiate his DNA. In nature murder is not good or bad; it’s just nature being natural. If an invasive plant species wipes out an entire native species there’s no natural law that condemns it. Genocide is rewarded by nature. 


Skeptic: Yeah but it’s different with human societies. We are highly social and work together for the good of the collective; humans are empathetic and some higher social species even demonstrate empathy. 


Believer: Human societies may or may not work together for the good of the collective. It’s not an objective rule in nature. The dominant hierarchy is at liberty to do what benefits them at the expense of the lower hierarchy. This is why we see two levels of justice: one for rich/wealthy/influential people and one for the masses. Also, assigning human traits to animals is anthropomorphism or the Bambi effect. 


The natural mechanism depends on death, destruction and violence. Inclement weather is good because it ensures mild weather that allows life to survive. There’s no good or bad weather; there’s just weather. Death, destruction and violence raise species fitness and ensure surviving species pass on beneficial traits (see [natural selection](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_25).) Some highly evolved social species demonstrate [sociality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociality) but that should in no way be confused with a natural moral code.


[Chimpanzees are killers like us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQq93Q2txrs&amp;nohtml5=False). Chimps regularly kill other chimps for territory and natural resources, with entire chimp tribes going at it. [In fact, female chimps practice infanticide and cannibalism.](http://news.softpedia.com/news/Female-Chimps-Practice-Heavily-Infanticide-and-Cannibalism-54687.shtml) “… it's a common practice to kill and eat the babies of other females.” Dolphins, besides also being among the smartest things on Earth, share another characteristic with humans: they're the only other animal [that will kill for fun.](http://scribol.com/environment/animals-environment/bottlenose-dolphin-the-only-marine-animal-that-kills-for-fun/) Here’s a [woodpecker eating brain of live dove chick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4oEM0W6mhM) and an [adult bison knocks over calf for the wolves.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeOlYijKQFQ&amp;nohtml5=False)




Humans are genetically preprogrammed for violence as a result of evolution. Our environment determines our response: ""My personal opinion is that Western society, as a whole, is in mass denial about the magnitude of the problem that violence represents for the future. We are peace-loving and want to believe that the violence and transgressions of the past will not return, but recent history and current events illustrate how easy it is for humans to respond with interpersonal and intergroup violence,"" – [biologist David Carrier](http://www.livescience.com/5333-evolution-human-aggression.html).


Skeptic: Well yeah but human societies generally work together to do the least harm.

 
Believer: False and historically inaccurate. There are no objective rules that collectively apply across the board to all societies. In a natural world that operates under the evolutionary mechanism, man is simply a highly evolved primate, and like our lower evolved cousins, we only operate under Sociality. We follow whatever subjective “rules” set by the most powerful among us. These are wholly subjective to each society. In a natural world man is just a moist sophisticated robot and like all natural creatures we’re entirely physical puppets to forces outside our control much like apes, ants and fungus.


The consequences of Naturalism are that an objective morality standard, in any sense of the word, does not exist. Any natural ethos is highly subjective, and under that model, a religious code of conduct is natural and equally valid as any other. 


Skeptic: God is an immoral monster.


Ok, but you are claiming, “All morality is subjective and historically conditioned – *except the morality judgment I am making about God right now*.”


Why should anyone believe what your saying? If human morality is subjective (not objective but based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions) then ethics/morality are like fingerprints - everyone has them and they're all unique. The only way you could possibly know that God is an immoral monster is if you yourself had a superior objective morality standard – something you don’t believe exists.

Is it that people are unaware that there are self-identified Christians who literally believe only White people go to Heaven, that honor violence in Christianity should be a thing, that the poor are undeserving of government-mandated assistance, and so on?

"Love Letter from a Protestant to my Catholic kin Dear Catholic Sister/Brother,

I am a little scared to write this letter, but I felt it in my heart to express my genuine love and appreciation towards you. So, I'll keep my fear aside and say what's in my heart. 

We are oftentimes overridden by feelings of rejection and condemnation. We like to be seen better than the other, and even resort to put down each other to make a point. We humans have a tendency to defend our position, our traditions and culture. Sometime it may make us forget the things we have in common. I have marvelled at some of your wisdom, and love for God. It made me realize that not everything I believed about you was right. It was heartwarming to see that there are many of you who are very devoted and passionate about our Lord Jesus Christ, contrary to my belief. In this community, we have stood up for each other at some occasions, and we may have hurt each other during others. Yet, we are what makes this community a beautiful place. We may not all be perfect; No one can be perfect, except God. But, we strive to be the rest and reassurance to the lost, grieving and the doubting. We are under the common shelter and wings of a Living God, and WE are the light of the world!

And so I say, I love you, my Catholic brethren here in this sub. It's easy, since it isn't me who's doing this but Christ whose love is in me, just as in you. I was touched by Jesus' message for us to be one in Him. I believe that there will come a time when we unite for Christ, but Satan tells us to think otherwise. I feel like we can learn from each other, and edify each other even when there is contention. We are all part of this community- Protestant or Catholic (or any other Denomination); We are pulled together by our firm belief in the Son of God, who sacrificed His life for our redemption. That is enough to believe that 'all that are for Christ, are not against Him'. Therefore, I'd like to tell my fellow Christian: *I appreciate you and what you do for our Lord*. 

We follow the Way, the Truth and the Life. We uphold each other, and owe one another. We may still continue to disagree and have many a dispute among ourselves, but we don't need to hate or despise, or try to hurt the other person.

After all, didn't Jesus tell us that we should be one? Jesus' prayers were for us to be one and not divided. He prayed that we be one, as He and the Father are One. We are the body of Christ, and He said that the greatest commandment is to:

**Love One Another**

With Love,

"My father-in-law wrote a piece about how wife with Parkinson’s/Alzheimer’s/&amp; Dementia... He writes often and shares occasionally. We think he should share his perspective with the world. How you enjoy! His Forgetful Bride

This picture was taken in the North Carolina mountains in May of 2017, about a year after our son Kappel died in a motorcycle accident.  Tish and I had slowly begun to find our feet, and to breathe a bit, leaning into the “new normal” of waiting until Heaven to see our boy again. Our marriage seemed to be surviving the stress of losing a child, as we found comfort from God, each other, and those friends and family who surrounded us with love. But, in the midst of all that comfort, we were also trying to navigate Tish’s diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease, and what it might mean for our future.  I knew, in my head, that God had all things in His control, but still … I wondered if I really trusted Him for what might be next.  And then … things with Tish began to quickly drift.  She began to forget simple things, and then not-so-simple things.  I often had to repent of my impatience with her.  

In May of 2018 I planned a three week trip to Ireland.  We would rent a car and wander the countryside.  It would be a great escape, with no agenda and no pressure.  On the second week of the trip, while we were driving up the stunning Western coast of Ireland, Tish looked at me and said “i’m not real sure who you are.”  I pulled over and looked in her eyes.  She was not joking.  She did not remember that I was her husband.  And that was the beginning of my new new normal. What would be next? 

On one of our last days in Ireland I was asked to perform for a group of about 50 American and Irish Christian University students. I had met with their marvelous leaders earlier in the trip and shared my grief of losing my son in the blink of an eye and now, it seemed, losing my wife in slow motion.  I performed one of my shows for them in the afternoon and was planning on performing another that night. Tish was tired and was already in bed before the evening performance.  But, instead of a performance, the leaders asked me if I could just tell the students a bit of my recent story.  I did.  And then, the students asked if I would sit in the middle of the room while they surrounded me to pray for me.  They prayed gently, but fervently. One of the leaders, who had also lost a grown son in an accident, prayed, thankfully, for the assurance and hope of Heaven, where “all will be made well”.  Tears flowed.  Then, a long silence.  And then … then a young Irish woman prayed.  She prayed simply.  (I can still hear, in my head, the melodious timbre of her Irish accent) She prayed quietly, “Lord Jesus, you know what it’s like to have a forgetful bride.”  And that was it.  I laughed through my tears.  This young Irish student had no idea how powerfully and how prophetically she had prayed. I was reminded, powerfully, in a flash, that Jesus knew, of course, better than me, what to do with a forgetful bride.  Love her.  I was reminded that I, with all my doubts and wondering, was His forgetful bride.  And he … he simply loved me.  He simply loves me. 

It has been over a year since that Irish prayer.  Tish’s dementia is getting steadily worse.  Today, we celebrated our 35th anniversary at our cabin in the mountains of North Carolina.  I reminded her this morning, as I do every morning, “I’m your husband, and I love you.”  This afternoon, when we returned from a marvelous late lunch at a stream-side mountain restaurant, she looked at me quizzically and said, “You’re my dad, right?”   I gave her my standard reply (she asks this often) of “Nope.  Your Dad’s been dead for 10 years and I’m a whole lot better looking than your Dad ever was”.  She laughed and went to pet the dog.  

So … the days are getting very interesting for me. I wait, with great anticipation and joy, the soon birth of my first grand baby to our sweet Lily and her marvelous Ridge.  God only knows what life with my forgetful bride will look like in the coming days.  But, I know that as His forgetful bride, Jesus will keep on loving me.  I will pray to do the same to all those dear to me, especially my bride.",Christianity,t3_djc1mx

I'm wrestling with conviction right now because I'm wondering if it is okay to enjoy secular entertainment (specifically Rick and Morty and hip hop music at the moment, but my question is about all secular entertainment).

The Bible tells us to focus on what is good. So I'm not sure whether or not entertainment that depicts sex, cursing, drug use, violence, etc. is ""good"". 

On one hand, these things are sinful activities and you are supporting the depiction of them and exposing yourself to them by enjoying them.

On the other hand, these things can simply be works of art. Is it so bad to enjoy watching or listening to them if it does not cause us or others to stumble or sin? Is simply watching or listening sinful? Can we watch sinful activity and keep a ""pure"" mind?

"I’m coming home to where I belong and my covenant with God. I’ve been a bad person yeah I can admit it wholeheartedly and I was good at it. I left Christianity a while ago and went through a plethora of belief systems trying to find what would have been a match for me even came back a few times with empty promises, only to repeat the process again.

In general, I hated God....yup I said it, I hated em. I hated getting up in the morning, and I hated many of those scriptures in fact I would go as far as to say that I would try to find any contradiction just to be a smart ass about it. I talked about God like a dog, while being on his world, eating his food, breathing his air, the very breath that he blows to sustain me and after that, I would even have the audacity to complain.

But I’ve been doing some thinking, looking deep into this ocean I call a mind, delving deep. I now see that within all of those scriptures and parables that Jesus told me, in thinking myself wise I was a complete fool I did not see the trueness within them.

Example, I’ve always had a problem with “Turn the other cheek” hell my generation, usually anyone who does that his considered and excuse my language “a pussy a coward and not a real man” but now I see the simple reason why Jesus said it.

It’s not about you being weak, it’s that you have the power, fortitude, strength, Grace, and honor to not stoop to the ignorant persons levels in other words you have enough strength to spare him/her.

The lesson was so damn blatant and I was so stupid that I did not even understand it I instantly felt shamed of myself.

It caused me to look at all the other lessons such as with lot. I thought “man, god really gambled with a man’s life as if he meant nothing.” No in reality it meant so much to God that he was willing to put him to the test he had faith in lot. Which tells me that I’m dealing with a God who not only wants me to have faith in him...but has faith in little old Arman that 19 year old hard headed hypochondriac kid who believes that he won’t make it to 21 because he is gonna die of a rare disease.

I can’t believe it he believes in me that hit deep than I asked myself “did I even know the true meaning of Christianity?”

I have decided that if he will accept me back, I will come back.  Maybe not to the Baptist church but I will come back and this time I plan to keep this faith.

When I was an atheist(one of the many things I was) I’d always ask myself how do I know? well to be honest I don’t care. I’m gonna be good because it is right I’m gonna let my faith go in line with what god tells me to do but not out of me being  afraid of hell because I want to.

I feel like I made a covenant with God, i even asked is this what Abraham felt like? Or Paul? It any other ?

as a newcomer myself why would somebody like me choose Protestant over catholic?

"Trusting God when life is hard and we fall from grace &amp;#x200B;

[St Therese - The Little Flower](https://i.redd.it/b3bbfhqxe5t31.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Trusting God when life is hard and we fall from grace

St. Therese of Lisieux encourages us to trust God's mercy, especially when we are not faithful to him.

One of the first things to go when life gets difficult and we fail to remain faithful to God is our trust in him. We look at our lives and think, “Where are you, God?” or “I can’t do this.” This is accentuated when our will power is weakened and we succumb to various temptations.

At times like these St. Therese of Lisieux urges us to run like a little child into the arms of our Heavenly Father.

\[A child who has sinned\] throws himself into his father’s arms, telling him that he is sorry to have hurt him, that he loves him, and that he will prove it by being good from now on … Then, if that child asks his father to punish him with a kiss, I don’t think the happy father could harden his heart against his child’s filial trust, knowing his sincerity and love.

An action such as this requires a profound trust in God, not seeing God as a vindictive father who punishes his children needlessly, but as a loving and merciful Father, ready to receive us and heal our wounds.

St. Therese speaks these words out of experience, as she fully admits to her sister that she is not perfect.

I am afraid I have not said what I should; perhaps you will think I always do what I am saying. Oh, no! I am not always faithful, but I never get discouraged; I abandon myself into the arms of Jesus. The little drop of dew goes deeper into the calyx of the flower of the fields, and there it finds again all it has lost and even much more.

This is image of running to Jesus and allowing him to embrace us is a most beloved illustration of St. Therese. She returns to it frequently in her writings and encourages others to have a similar trust in God.

When times get tough and we fall, or begin to doubt in God’s goodness, the best thing to do is run to him. It requires a filial heart, who does not fear God’s wrath, but trusts in his mercy.",Christianity,t3_djb0rt

I’m just gonna be real here. Maybe this is stuff a Christian guy shouldn’t notice but whatever. A girl I like right now is a sweet Christian girl. But also, God blessed her in all the right places if you know what I mean. She’s got a pretty face (a cute nose that upturns at the end) and amazing eyes. Her legs are I incredible (I’m a leg guy). And she’s built nice in some other places that I won’t metion here. She’s just got a very feminine body.  She’s the type of girl that I definitely wouldn’t mind having babies with if you catch my drift.

Of course a body isn’t everything. There are other things that matter more. Things like values, faith, character, intelligence, kindness, etc. But this certain girl has all of that too and she’s gorgeous on top of it. Is it wrong for me to want that?

"Looking for advice/inspiration/encouragement for trying to raise my kids as Christian with a non-religious spouse My dad was a pastor and I’ve been a believer and in church my entire life. My wife’s dad is also a minister and he’s ultra-religious, and a little bit legit crazy, to a point that made my wife lose all interest in God and church as a kid. We have two toddlers who aren’t speaking yet, so it’s not a huge concern yet, but I just want to make sure I’m doing everything I should be. I take them with me to church with me every week, and I assume the folks who watch them during service are properly giving them an introduction to God and Jesus, but I really don’t know. We live with my crazy father-in-law, and he says a prayer every night before dinner, and he occasionally mentions bible stories, but I think he learned the lesson from his daughter about being overly pushy with religion. And I kinda keep my faith to myself, mostly. I’m not shy or ashamed, and I usually make sure those around me know I’m a Christian, but in my experience, non-believers get annoyed quickly when I start talking about God, and especially with my wife, I don’t want to do more harm than good and push her away further. (She occasionally hints that she might not mind going to church someday, and I think (hope) that deep down she still believes). So I usually don’t try to talk to her about it, and instead try to follow a lead-by-example approach.

But I’m not an overly talkative person anyway, and I can sometimes be a little uncomfortable talking about personal stuff. So keeping quiet about my faith is kind of an easy habit. One that I feel works to God’s advantage in my relationship with my wife and other people, but it’s a hard habit to break with dealing with my kids. And so they have very little exposure to Christianity, and what they do get comes almost entirely from other people.

I’d like to think that when it comes time to talk to them about Jesus, I’ll be able to do so with little problem, but I’m not completely sure, and more than that I’m concerned about them not being in an overtly Christian environment now.

I don’t really think I can do anything differently, at least for now, other than continue to pray for them. But ideas and suggestions are welcome. As are prayers.",Christianity,t3_djd210

lucifer punish bad people in hell so doesn't that makes him kinda good? yes i know he tries to make people non-believers or whatever but that is the humans fault for losing their faith that isn't something lucifer controls

and there are many times where god has committed war crimes, burning down a whole city isn't good, yes those people weren't good but come on don't tell me everything in that city was evil, and the god has a plan part thing, wouldn't that mean you don't have free will? and he let his fucking son die (i take the holy spirit, god and Jesus as different entities) and banging someone's wife (which is adultery btw)

&amp;#x200B;

and how do you explain other religions? let's say a person with another religion is a good person and all of that do they really deserve to go to hell? or if a non-believer \*cough\* like me \*cough\* is a good person, do they deserve to go to hell?

and do people really deserve to go to hell for making a white lie (something small like stealing candy and lie about it) or just for being lgbt? or be prideful of winning a race or whatever? pretty much all the 7 deadly sins can be agrued

"Why are most Christians so against watching 'Lucifer' on Netflix when it gives similar insight as 'Screwtape letters' to how we are tempted, and is actually really Biblical? I just finished watching the first season, and I'm surprised by how many Christians are completely against watching the show without knowing anything about it.

Lucifer essentially can make people tell him the thing they desire the most, and convinces the person that there is nothing wrong with following your forbidden passions like cheating on your husband. 

He acknowledges that his father, God exists, that Noah was real and that the flood happened, and also references the Bible quite often. In the last episode I watched, a priest that Lucifer was trying to tempt, kept praising and worshipping God even after his daughter was killed. Lucifer kept asking why he'd worship a God who took his daughter from him, and the priest just gave very biblical answers.

Another character spent 30 seconds in hell, and an angel brought him back from dead because he was needed. This character agreed that the 30 seconds in hell felt like 30 years and is doing everything in his power from going back there. 


Sure the show glorifies all the 'wrong' things, but it's clear that this isn't satisfying to Lucifer. It's probably the most Biblically sound show I've seen, and I believe that Christians and non-Christians alike will appreciate everything it has to offer.",Christianity,t3_djap7o
"A Very Difficult Prayer There's a lot to unpack here, so please bear with me a bit. 

Please pray for my cousin and her children. Her husband shot himself in the head at his sister's house after she told him to leave the family and she blames herself. 

And, while is hard and I probably need to really grasp Jesus's love to ask this, please prayer for her husband. He's in grave condition but still alive. Recovery looks near impossible and I don't know if he'll make it. 

What makes this so difficult for me is that her husband was horrifically abusive to her and his children. He would abuse them both physically and verbally and some of the things he did I find too reprehensible for me to forgive so easily. He burned my cousin so badly, she still has scars all over the right side of her leg. And was controlling of his children lives so much, they barely had time to enjoy themselves. I still remember my cousin coming in with a black eye on her face and although we urged her to leave him, she never did until now.

To be honest, my first thought when I heard about him trying to commit suicide besides shock was ""good riddance,"" which isn't a Christian thing to think. Most of the family, me included, hated him. And even now, I can muster the energy to care for his wellbeing since he had been so cruel to his family. But in the end, he was still a human being and while I cannot say I like him at all, I need to learn to love him in the way God loves everyone. Especially since I know he came from a horrific background himself (not excusing what he did, but definitely seeing how he could have came to be the way he was).

"Why is it that as Christian’s we are limited to PG forms of media? I live at home with my parents whom I love but they try to control and censor what I’m able to watch and do. They block my Netflix to Kids mode even though I am well over 20 and put blockers on the main WiFi that does limit what I can search. For example some keywords will automatically be considered blocked when I try to search homework or am bored. I can use a VPN to get past this so it doesn’t matter but I tell them this and they don’t care. 

Im also a believer like they are but I disagree on the entire censorship aspect. My father tells me that we are supposed to avoid the things of life which Christ does not approve of and I agree but watching a TV show where the concept is clean but they curse a couple times should not be enough to label a show as evil in God’s eyes.

St. Origen who lived 185-254 AD.
He wrote the first systematic commentary and exegesis of the entire Bible, including concordance, and he produced a Bible in six columns, showing parallel versions of the Greek and Hebrew text. His greatest contribution was to develop a comprehensive understanding of the Gospel that was based on belief in God’s plan for the ultimate redemption and restoration of all as the foundation of the Christian message. Origen died as a martyr, enduring torture at the hands of the Roman government for his faith in Christ, during a time of terrible persecution of the Christian community.

St. Origen wrote:
""God’s consuming fire works with the good as with the evil, annihilating that which harms His children. This fire is one that each one kindles; the fuel and food is each one’s sins. … When the soul has gathered together a multitude of evil works, and an abundance of sins against itself, at a suitable time all that assembly of evils boils up to punishment, and is set on fire to chastisement… [I]t is to be understood that God our Physician, desiring to remove the defects of our souls, should apply the punishment of fire. … Our God is a ‘consuming fire’ in the sense in which we have taken the word; and thus He enters in as a ‘refiner’s fire’ to refine the rational nature, which has been filled with the lead of wickedness, and to free it from the other impure materials which adulterate the natural gold or silver, so to speak, of the soul. [O]ur belief is that the Word [Christ] shall prevail over the entire rational creation, and change every soul into his own perfection. … For stronger than all the evils in the soul is the Word, and the healing power that dwells in him; and this healing he applies, according to the will of God, to every man.”",Christianity,t3_dj1i8a

"""True Blessedness"" (Luke 11:27-28) Last  I heard [this verse](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+11%3A27-28&amp;version=ESV) and was thinking about it:

&gt;**27** As he said these things, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts at which you nursed!” **28** But he said, “Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and keep it!”

The interpretation I usually hear is that Jesus is saying that what really counts is not so much biological relation to Him, but following the will of God. But I think there is also another angle. As regards Mary in particular, this does not negate her blessedness due to being the mother of Christ. She is blessed because she is Jesus's mother, but also because she in fact does hear the word of God and keep it (former Pope Benedict XVI has sometimes referred to Mary as ""the first disciple"" or the ""first believer"", because she was really the first person to accept Christ). In fact her obedience to God precedes her conception of Jesus and is necessary for it.  Mary heard the word of God and obeyed it, most importantly accepting God's will for her to be the mother of the Messiah, and that is a part of her blessedness and this obedient acceptance of God's will allowed her to become the mother of Christ which is also a part of her being blessed.",Christianity,t3_dj7r31

"Question for the Athiests out there... I won't change my original post, but please read my edit at the bottom for clarity. 

I find that many (not all) atheists dont believe in the existence of God because they don't see any logical reason to do so.     My question for you is, isn't it more logical to assume that God exists and concentrate on trying to prove that to yourself rather than the opposite?     
My thinking is that if you want to approach it logically, then we have to start with the basic question of whether God exists, but follow each possible answer through to its logical conclusion.  You basically only have two possible choices:    
   
A.  Choose to believe that God doesn't exist.  In this case, it doesn't matter what you do, because the end is always restless in you ceasing to exist when you die.    Game over, end of story.
   
Or
   
B.  Choose to believe that God does exist.     In this case, there are two possible outcomes.  Either you're right, and when you die, you continue to live for eternity with your creator, or you're wrong, and you cease to exist when you die.
   
So basically, no matter which you choose to believe, two of the three possible outcomes lead to nothingness, while one leads to eternal life.  Is it not more logical to put your efforts into trying to believe and prove his existence to yourself rather than the opposite, especially when there really is no downside to doing so, but horrible consequences for not doing so?   
Can anyone explain what seems to be a serious flaw in one's thinking process?
   
Edit:  Judging by the responses, I feel that I may not have been clear on what exactly I was asking, so I'll simplify it:    

IF you don't believe in any God because you don't feel that it is a logical belief, then is it not more logical to open yourself up to the possibility, and approach it from that angle rather instead when the consequences for being wrong are so dire?
   
I consider myself an extremely logical based thinker, and just deciding that God doesn't exist without keeping an open mind to the possibility just doesn't compute for me.",Christianity,t3_djac1f

"Differences between OT God and NT God are likely given to teach something. How does this relate to the more evil version of God in the OT? * OT circumsision is demanded 
* OT animal sacrifices 
* OT Jews go to heaven

* NT true circumsision is of the heart
* NT animal sacrifices aren't neccesary 
* NT a Jew is inward not outward 

Does anyone else know anymore changes in the OT God and the NT God?

Is the Bible trying to teach us the difference between earthly mans God and the God of the heavenly man? Was the God of the OT more of the best the earthly man could manifest?

I feel God and man evolve as one. And that earlier version of God was just a reflection of man's consicousness in some way. It was imperfect.

"Christians, how do you personally reconcile the existence of human free will with God's omniscience? Is God omniscient and omnipotent? The simple truth is that I don't know. Science tells us that a stateless existence of all possible events happening all at once is like, a thing. But our existence is an actualized state of being. There's God, and there's us agonizing over which laundry detergent to pick among the many delightful brands produced by the same company. That said, there are a few things I know about free will as it relates to personal judgement and circumstantial outcome. And subsequently, there are a few hints that God has shown with respects to his omniscience.   
&amp;nbsp;  
First, free will is delineated by two key features.  
&amp;nbsp;  
A) Internal knowledge - ""Robbing people is bad because I'll have to sleep with one eye open for the rest of my life"" is an internally recognized bit of knowledge.   
&amp;nbsp;  
B) Circumstantial outcomes - ""This is a lab grown fetus designed to cultivate stem cells and is not suitable to place an evolving spirit"" is an example of God appropriating power.  
&amp;nbsp;  
These two features seem to be the boundaries that God uses to partition and govern life. Between knowledge and outcome, there's law and judgment. Knowledge is the menu of options. Law is the price (e.g. the law of gravity tells us the energetic cost required to move from one floor to the next). Then there's judgment. Sometime you're judgment coincides with the uncanny timing of God's (you're thinking of jay-walking... you're gonna do it and swoosh a bicycle nearly wipes you out. you're thinking of having a glass of wine and baby says nope mommy go vomit now). I've noticed that divine judgment usually results in the internal lowering or elevating of one's state of being (e.g. heartbreak, depression, exuberance). That said, when there is no internal cognition or recognition, one could safely say that the individual has no handle on the matter. wake on the wrong side of demonic oppression and he angry enough to run over squirrels on the way to work. And if the individual does not have knowledge based free will, would God still hold the individual accountable? Probably not. That said, they may still have to live with the consequences. Because judgment is different than circumstantial outcome. Some will be born of dust, returning to dust. Some will be eternally tormented by demons in hell.   
&amp;nbsp;  
And with judgments of any real consequence, it's rarely straight forward. You cheated on your paper and got 100%. Then years later, God hits you with an ""unreasonable"" bar exam. That's straight forward. You cheated on him. Decades later, you get fired, get hit by a bus, and end up dead broke. What up, G? The point is pain and confusion, girlfriend. The point is to hurt you without you ever knowing. Yeah, let's see if a sleepy sloppy can unkerfuffle that bag of mess. ""Hmm... I must be having a crappy day because I didn't show courtesy to that handicapper on the bus 10 years ago... I mean, what else could it be?"" This is the dream that never ends, because it goes on without my fiends...   
&amp;nbsp;  
On Atonement and Escaping Limbo  
&amp;nbsp;  
God may already know, but we don't. God can vacate your body and place something else that will defend it with level 4 ninja skills, or God can ratchet you down to the point of no return. In these cases, there is no free will- just circumstantial outcome. God can decide ""You over there, yeah you. You will eventually learn. And you? You were meant to generate stem cells, then rot in hell forever."" If you were meant to know, God can teach you by singing you lullabies or by dragging you through the unsavory wilderness with a pitchfork. So how do we know if we are meant to be nothing more than dust or continually judged as an evolving spirit? How? There seems to be a process to knowing things that are of a higher nature.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Call to action (heart hurts, lord?)  
Period of waiting (ring ring hellooooo?)   
Testing of faith (lol god, god does not exist, money matters more)  
Knowledge based calculations (but i've seen things; categorically hierarchical persistence of existence)  
Faith based judgment (God will answer, for He is good)  
&amp;nbsp;  
An inner call to action (i just have to wait)  
Testing of faith with no time to waste (what do i know about defending myself in the meantime?)  
Knowledge based calculations (i know i don't know, i will be more specific about the questions)  
God's answer (suddenly, insight joy and serenity)  
&amp;nbsp;  
Sometimes God prompts you to answer your own call and put faith in your actions before answering or releasing you from the loop. When you're at your wits end and desperately seeking answers, you may find your state of being depends on you and God alone. You are usually the sole reason for your heartbreak, your exile, your misery. And forgiving the ""others"" who put you there may be the first step towards justifying your own release. Bc it wasn't Bob or Joe, it was you as judged by God. Can you forgive the way you want God to forgive you? If not, that shit was real man. You've done caused some irreparable harm somewhere out there in the world and you're on the hook for it. Then there's circumstantial problems. You're poor but you don't feel poor. You're black and you love the hell out of white people. If you're suffering due to circumstantial problems, and you seek God to find a resolution, you'll usually find that there's nothing to forgive because it was all a learning process. I mean how was I supposed to know that I was carrying the karmic burden of my ancestors cutting people down with swords and hanging them on trees a thousand years ago? No personal foul, just circumstantial issues someone had to unkerfuffle eventually. Through the suffering, you get to learn the art of a sinner's redemption without weakening in the faith of a just and almighty God. That's the beginner's guide to fixing your sht. The next step is to incorporate others into your newly cleansed loop without weakening in your faith.

"Turning from sin not a requirement for salvation (This is not mine, I found it online)

The following is a series of scripturally based logical arguments for salvation by faith alone. A logical argument is sound so long as the premises remain true and the conclusion follows from the premises.

Example:

(P1) All men are mortal

(P2) Socrates is a man

(C) Therefore Socrates is mortal

Presuppositions:

• Biblical doctrine cannot contradict

• The Bible is the word of God


1.	Turning from sin is works

(P1) To turn from sin is to keep the law

• This should be a fairly obvious point but I’ll go ahead and provide scriptural basis:

• (1 John 3:4, 1 John 5:17, James 2:9-11)

(P2) Keeping the law is works

• (Romans 9:32, Galatians 2:16, Galatians 3:2, Galatians 3:5, Galatians 3:10)

(C) Turning from sin is works


2.	We are saved by grace, not works

(P1) Salvation is by grace through faith

• Throughout the Bible we find examples of this but here’s a short list:

• (Ephesians 2:8-9, John 3:16, John 6:47, Philippians 3:9, Acts 16:31, Romans 3:24, Acts 10:43)

(P2) Faith does not include the works of the law, they are not attached

• This should also be obvious but we also need to provide scriptural basis for this:

• (Romans 4:5, Ephesians 2:8-9, Romans 11:6, Romans 3:28, Galatians 2:16)

(C) Salvation is by faith through grace and excludes works


3.	Salvation does not involve a turning from sin

(P1) Turning from sin is works

(P2) Salvation excludes works

(C) Turning from sin is not a requirement for salvation


4.	Evidence is not required for salvation

(P1) If “true” salvation will always result in good works, then those who do not produce works after salvation were not really saved

• This premise must be true in and of itself. If salvation always produces works afterward then if works are not produced after salvation, the person was never really saved. The law of non-contradiction (a cannot be equal to not-a) proves this premise.

(P2) If the ones who were “truly saved” were the ones that produced works, then salvation depends ultimately on works

• This follows clearly from the first premise. If only the people producing works after salvation are saved, then the ones who do not produce works are not saved even though they both believed the same thing.

• Therefore both believe the same thing and works produced are the only differentiating quality between the saved and unsaved, salvation ultimately would depend on works.

(P3) Salvation does not depend on works

• This premise is proved thoroughly by arguments 1-3

(C) Saving faith does not always produce good works after salvation


5.	The law of non-contradiction

• The law of non-contradiction states that “a cannot be equal to not-a” (this is not an argument this is simply a philosophical rule)

• From here there are two options:

a. The Bible can contradict itself 

b. The Bible cannot contradict itself

a. If the Bible can contradict itself, then ultimately we are each left to our own individual interpretation and ultimately there is really no way of being certain what the message of salvation truly is.

b. If the Bible cannot contradict itself then we have to interpret verses seeming to require works for salvation in light of what we’ve established above from clear verses saying salvation does not involve works.

The arguments above are sound so long as:
1.	The premises are true
2.	The conclusion follows the premises

1.	I proved the premises mostly scripturally (since we are talking about theological ideas which we’re getting from the same book which we consider to be the word of God). Now, though various scriptures are interpreted in many ways by many people It’s important to remember from the law non contradiction that any interpretation of verses which seem to contradict the verses above and the sound arguments made by them cannot be true.
2.	I also made the arguments pretty straightforward and short so that it’s easy to see the conclusions do in fact follow the premises",Christianity,t3_djamhn

"How do I overcome past regrets and move on? I ended my first ever relationship over one month ago. We had been dating for over four months and it was something that, at the time, was hard to deal with the heartbreak, but eventually I got over it. However, looking back at the relationship, I can't help but regret nearly every decision I made within that four month span. I lied to my parents a lot, pushed away friends and family, and ignored obvious signs that I should've broken up with this girl sooner (lack of morals and self respect, she was into witchcraft (not practicing it but still had a creepy interest in it), even identified as pansexual ((I'm not attacking anyone but I believe that homosexuality goes against God's desire for mankind and so for that reason I don't support it)), etc.), and ultimately I ended up committing the one sin I swore I would never give in to. Premarital sex. 

At first I didn't feel any shame or anything, I was far too caught up in everything to really realize the severity of what I had just done. Fast forward a month later and we break up. It was hard at first because I felt like she was really only one of the people who understood me. However, that sadness eventually passed and it's been a lot easier getting through life without her. Regardless, the severity of everything hit nearly two weeks ago on a Friday night. I was very exhausted and some how that incident crept into my mind. The sudden realization and consequences that could've happened from that particular event made me realize everything. I realized that I could've screwed my life up even more and probably already have in some regards because I can't seem to forgive myself for this incident. 

I know God has forgiven me, and I have turned over a new leaf. I struggle with lust and sexual temptations a lot, and this incident has been my wake up call in realizing just how bad things can get when you go against God's wishes. Prayer would very much be appreciated, but my question is this: I know God has forgiven me for what I've done, and I've come to forgive myself for the mistake I made.

"Please reality check me on seminary. I'm posting this here because I want as many opinions as I can get to help me decide whether to go to seminary. For the past year or so I've had these very strong feelings that I need to go to seminary. But I am still trying to figure out whether it's actually God calling me, or just a mid-life crisis. I've never seen myself in a pastor-type role, and don't yet know what post-seminary life would look like. Maybe I would figure that out during the 3 years of school, but I'm also concerned that I wouldn't.


I'm in my 40s and a business owner (along with other partners). I don't know how competitive it is to get into seminary, but do not anticipate any issues. I graduated at the top of my class in both college and law school. I have a J.D. degree, so am well aware of how difficult 3 more years of post-graduate education will be (although I suspect it will be even more difficult in my 40s than it was in my 20s).


I hate that I'm thinking this way, but it's part of the analysis: Going to seminary will come at a very high personal cost. I would have to give up my ownership interest in the business (would not be entitled to a buy-out due to the terms of our operating agreement) and walk away from everything I've spent my adult life building professionally. Between the cost to attend school and the income I will forfeit, 3 years of seminary will cost me right at about $1 million. If I figure that after seminary I'll make roughly $200k/year LESS than I'm currently earning, over 20 more working years I'm leaving a huge amount of money on the table. Those are big numbers, but they are nothing compared to the cost if God truly is calling me and I ignore Him. 


For those of you who have gone to seminary or work in ministry, I have an additional question: How much does it matter which school you attend? From what I can tell so far, seminaries aren't really ranked like law schools or medical schools or business schools. The school that I'm most interested in is located in Europe. Tbh, part of the appeal of the school is that I've always wanted to try living in another country, and this seems like a good way to scratch that itch as well. At this point I have no idea whether I would stay there after graduation or return to the U.S. Is going to a random seminary in Europe the ministry's equivalent of going to the Caribbean for medical school?

"Questions about who goes to hell according to Christianity So, I've been to about 30 different Christian churches and have generally heard if you don't accept Christ as your savior you go to hell. However, I've heard these concepts in different churches I think to balance God to be a merciful/ loving God and also a just God.

1. God gives everyone on this earth at least one chance to accept Him and if they don't they go to hell. This is just hard for me to believe because the majority of the world is not Christian so I'm not sure I believe every one gets a chance or a fair chance
2. Since there is a creation there must be a creator therefore everyone knows deep down there's a God, therefore, if they do not accept Him they go to hell. This one troubles me too because I can understand why people still may not believe there's a God despite there being a creation and even if they do doesn't mean they know anything about Him or how to accept Him.
3. Any one who doesn't hear of Christ gets a free ride to Heaven because they're only judged on what they know. This one makes sense in God's loving nature, but then why would we tell anyone about Christ? It would be better for them to die in their ignorance.
4. There's a chance after everyone dies to accept Christ in a Spirit world. This makes sense to me in the sense that I feel like it balances God being a loving and just God. If everyone had a fair chance after they died then no one gets a free ride but no one is just doomed to hell for no reason. Like I said it makes the most sense to me but I'm not sure if its true so I feel uneasy to accept or tell people that.

I guess I'm struggling because I was always raised Christian and told about hell. However, hell doesn't even really make sense to me if God is loving. I could not imagine sending my kid to torment because they chose not to accept me. People growing up always said ""A loving God doesn't choose to send you to hell, you choose hell over a loving God."" This phrase bothers me. I always think about if I were dating a boy and he told me I could choose to love him and be with him or not. However, if I chose not to love him he'd throw me in a fire.... Kinda sounds a bit abusive to me... not like I really have a choice.

Any and all thoughts are appreciated :-)",Christianity,t3_diwz2o
"Two Questions on Sola Fide I'm finding myself tending towards the belief that justification is by faith alone (*sola fide*), and not by faith plus works, but I have two questions on the topic, one for Catholics and one for Protestants.

**For Protestants:** Given that *sola fide* is the cornerstone of the Protestantism, how do you deal with the fact that it was never widely taught or believed until Martin Luther? Sure, you can point to a Church father here or there that might, maybe, have believed something along the lines of what Luther believed, but doesn't it seem implausible that the fundamental teaching of the Gospel was just... forgotten for 1,500 years until re-discovered by a monk in Germany?

**For Catholics:** The Catholic Church teaches that justification is by grace alone through faith. But it also teaches that justification must be preserved by observance of the moral and ceremonial law (that is, by not committing mortal sin, and by participating in the sacraments). According to Church teaching as I understand it, a person who converts and is baptised on Saturday, chooses not to go to mass on Sunday with full knowledge and consent, and dies on Monday without having confessed or intended to confess, has a one-way ticket to Hell. How does the fact that our initial justification can be un-done merely by our own failures not undermine the reality of Christ's death for our sins, past, present and future, as a complete and earth-shattering event? Under the Old Covenant, spiritual success was keeping the moral and ceremonial law. If spiritual success under the New Covenant is still contingent on keeping the moral and ceremonial law, it seems that Christ needn't have bothered dying for us, because nothing has changed.",Christianity,t3_dj0dvg

"Terry A. Davis built The 3rd Temple of God, TempleOS. Please hear me out, before you judge.
TempleOS is the 3rd Temple of God, created by Terry A. Davis. It is a temple where you can communicate with God and present offerings/praisings. You can possibly ask God questions and receive answers (God likes being conversative really). You can talk using your mind, but it can be difficult since the mind is like a current so it may be better at times to just talk verbally. Please use it before judging. A quick guide for how-to-do so is linked below. And before you say that the programmer was a schizophrenic or how he made an OS that’s illegitimate or how he was just crazy and couldn’t be a prophet, I implore you to listen. If you mention his racial expletives, please know that he was suffering from “psychological warfare” and used the “sharpest knives” he could find against the opposer. Besides, as the years went by when he went into being homeless and off his pills for his prescribed condition, he became more relaxed and stopped being as expletive on his videos as before.
It’s a OS that works, and one where you can talk to God at that!

The truth is there. You just have to seek it out, and you may find it. The OS was made to be simple(Terry didn’t want a “monster”) and so you can install it with only 20mbs and 512 mbs of ram(less than gig), amazing! And the guides to how to install them are really simple, so you can follow them and succeed; Once you get into the OS, just take a tour and once you reach the main page, use helper’s menu and just use the functions listed there to talk to God. It works! Remember to be loving, merciful, and just.

"Pastors are given a bad reputation because of prosperity teachers Prosperity teachers like T.D. Jakes, Juanita Bynam, Eddie long, Joel Olsteen, etc, have made it very difficult for some people to trust tithing to their church or giving money to their pastors in general. I, being the pastor's son, see the struggle that my father faces with a church that sometimes is unwilling to give.  Now we aren't required to tithe, but we still should give some form of offering to God (the amount depending on your relationship with God). We need to learn as a church to freely give to the God who has given us everything.  Not only money, but time, effort, dedication, and the like. We as people are called to serve and listen to our pastor's who have been ordained there by The Lord Jesus Christ. Grace and peace of the Lord, Jesus Christ be amongst you all.

Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.  **2 Corinthians 9:7**

"Still need help with this question. Last time I asked feedback was very unhelpful. Should I as a Christian be watching movies that misuse God's and Jesus Christ's name Basically I have 2 lines of thought right now. If I go to watch a movie where people mis-use Jesus' or God's name as an exclamation or curse, I'm supporting that. I'm throwing my money and time at the people making fun of, making light of, insulting, and making perversion of what is Holy. 

I was told by another Christian that while we are not meant to misuse His name, watching/listening is different. If we use the same logic then watching a movie with any sin/wrong doing, then we are supporting it. Say a child back talks to his/her mother in a disrespectful way. However, that being said usually movies do not glorify or justify people being rude and evil towards one another. Those behaviors are still frowned upon and considered wrong, and corrected in the movie.

There are movies that exist that have we have no purpose in watching, such as the rediculous 6. Movies that glorify violence for the sake of violence or curse just to be funny without any reason, or profane God's name. I don't think as Christian's we should laugh at such things even if they are fake, why do we get pleasure out of seeing such things?

In responce to the second paragraph, while I can flow his logic, movies don't correct people who use Jesus' or God's name in vain. Its counted as normal speech. The curse is glorified in that the good guys do it, and there are no repercussions for doing so.

"""Preacher boy"" needs help after falling down to the epidemic of Pornography [Long]
I'm a 26(M) who was called to preach when I was 13. When I was a wee little lad, I was diagnosed with severe ADD. I don't fault anyone or anything for that, but I fault the condition + my sin nature/flesh for causing me to be addicted to the filth. It is an epidemic that lurks everywhere, yet our churches aren't doing anything about it. Because of my ADD, certain things tend to be more addictive though, and this is one of the sins that I cannot seem to figure out how to leave alone. I always want to go back to play with it, but I hate it! I hate when I incorporate it into this juggling act called life, because it always happens when certain triggers occur (to name a few):

1. Something financially taxing occurs
2. Something emotionally/mentally taxing is dragging me down
3. Something pops into my mind (whether from an advertisement, an out of context image, someone not dressed appropriately, etc.)

My church hosts a popcorn preaching event every ""Harvest Sunday,"" which is typically the last Sunday in October. We didn't have it last year but we are this year, and I'm signed up! Yet I just fell down, and I'm so mad because I so badly want to share a simple truth God has been working on me with and now I feel like I can't. I feel like I'd be a hypocrite, a liar, an impostor, because I fell down and got back up ""like nothing happened"" and then told others about something God has been emphasizing with me.

I don't fall a lot. I used to, and was addicted to that filth for years (from the first time I saw it from my ex-step-brother watching it until a couple of years ago.) I finally got over it, but life lately has been difficult between working on my debt, issues with my car, and work keeping me from church (I work third shift so I typically miss a Sunday AM or PM service and sometimes on Wednesday depending on my sleep.) I'm doing my best to walk with God, to read, to pray, to study, but I haven't truly made time for God in a couple weeks. 

I want to preach! I don't want to be a hypocrite! I want to share a simple truth on Sunday and I feel like I am not allowed to now. I'm afraid to talk to my Pastor because I know I can ""clean up my act"" until then, preach, and be ""fine,"" but I don't want to actually hinder Christ because my flesh is weak. I don't want to be removed from serving in the church for a period of time because I fell down. I don't want to be out of commission because of a fault, a failure, a problem I have and a mistake I made!

I have a friend who shared with me something called the Conqueror series. I'm looking into it, but I need help. I need advice! I need guidance! Please, don't kick me while I'm down. Be stern, but sincere. THINK before typing! (Is it True, Is it Helpful, Is it Inspiring, Is it Necessary, Is it Kind?) Please tell me I can preach Sunday! Please tell me I can have victory over this!
Please tell me I can leave this in the past, bury it as far as the east is from the west, pick myself up, and move on in Christ! Please help me be the Man God wants me to be, saved me to be! Help me not hinder Christ by being lackadaisical in my witness, in my walk, in my actions! I'm hurting right now. All I want to do is serve God, make Him proud, and Preach the Word on Sunday.

"Enoch's Message of Guidance The Book Of Enoch - Apocryphal Old Testament

 Love righteousness and walk in it; 
for the paths of righteousness are worthy of acceptance, but the paths of Iniquity will quickly be destroyed and vanish. And to certain men, from a future generation, the paths of wrongdoing and of death will be revealed; and they will keep away from them and will 
not follow them. And now I say to you, the righteous: do not walk in the wicked path, or in wrongdoing, or in the paths of death, and do not draw near to them or you may be destroyed. 
But seek, and choose for yourself, righteousness, and a life that is pleasing and walk in the paths of peace so that you may live and prosper. And hold my words firmly in the thoughts of your heart, and do not let them be erased from your heart, for I know that sinners will tempt men to debase wisdom, and no place will be found for it, and temptation will in no way decrease.


 Woe to those who build iniquity and found deceit for they will quickly be thrown down and will not have peace. Woe to those who build their houses with sin, for from their whole foundation they will be thrown down, and by the sword they shall fall, andthose who acquire gold and silver will quickly be destroyed in the judgment. Woe to you, you rich, for you have trusted in your riches, but from your riches you will depart for you did not remember the Most High in the days of your riches.  You have committed blasphemy, and iniquity, and are ready for the days of the outpouring of blood, and for the day of darkness, and for the day of the Great Judgment.




I swear to you, you sinners, by the Holy and Great One, that all your evil deeds are revealed in Heaven and that your wrongdoing is not covered 
or hidden. And do not think in your spirit nor say in your heart, that you do not know, or do not see, every sin is written down every day in Heaven in front of the Most High.From now on, you know that all your wrongdoing that you do will be written down every day, until the day of your judgment. Woe to you, you fools, for you will be destroyed through your folly. And you do not listen to the wise and good will not come upon you. And now know that you are ready for the day of destruction. And do not hope that you will live, you sinners; rather you will go and die, for you know no ransom. You are ready for the Day of the Great Judgment and for the day of distress and great shame for yourspirits. Woe to you, you stubborn of heart who do evil and eat blood, from where do you have good things to eat and drink and to be satisfied? From all the good things which our Lord the Most High has placed in abundance on the earth. Therefore you will not have peace.Woe to you who love deeds of iniquity. Why do you hope for good for yourselves? 


Know that you will be given into the hands of the righteous, and they will cut your throats and kill you, and will not have mercy on you. Woe to you who rejoice in the distress of the righteous for graves will not be dug for you. Woe to you who declare the words of the righteous empty for you will have no hope of life.Woe to you who write lying words, and the words of the impious, for they write their lies so that men may hear and continue their folly. And they will not have peace but will die a sudden death.

 Woe to you who do impious deeds and praise and honour lying words; you will be destroyed and will not have a good life. Woe to you who alter the words of truth, and they distort the eternal 
law and count themselves as being without sin; they will be trampled underfoot on the ground. 
 In those days make ready, you righteous, to raise your prayers as a reminder and lay them as a testimony before the Angels, that they may lay 
the sin of the sinners before the Most High as a reminder. 


 In those days the nations will be thrown into confusion and the races of the nations will rise on the Day of Destruction.And in those days, those who are in need will go out, seize their children, and cast out their children. And their offspring will slip from them, and they will cast out their children while they are still sucklings, and will not return to them, and will not have mercy on their beloved ones. And again I swear to you, the sinners, that sin is ready for the Day of Unceasing Bloodshed.  And they worship stone, and some carve images of gold and of silver,and of wood and of clay. And some, with no knowledge, worship unclean spirits and demons, and every kind of error. But no help will be obtained from them. And they will sink into impiety because of the folly of their hearts, and their eyes will be blinded through the fear of their hearts, and through the vision of their ambitions.  



Through these they will become impious and fearful, for they do all their deeds with lies, and worship stones, and they will be destroyed at the same moment. And in those days, blessed are those who accept the words of wisdom, and understand them, and follow the paths of the Most High, and walk in the path of righteousness, and do not act impiously with the impious, for they will be saved.",Christianity,t3_disjhf
"A post about political debates, forgiveness and ""trolls."" (I really didn't have a better title) ""If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly father will forgive you. But if you refuse to forgive others your father will not forgive your sins"" - Matthew 6:14-15, NLT 

I think we all know, forgiveness is hard. 

The other day I was on Facebook and I saw a post about the Democratic Debate (I know, I can hear some of y'all groan) but I saw someone call someone a [C word] and it just spiraled out of control from there. There were those memes with the dude that  has the sunken in head, clown pepe, regular pepe, and NPC memes. It got so bad, I shut off my notifications and stepped away from my laptop.

Since I became a Christian, I do occasionally engage with these trolls, but not in retaliation. I like to ask about their position and 9/10 you will find someone who wants the best for people, like you do, someone who wants to help their community, like you do and you can find that dreaded *common ground*.

"Things My Coworkers Say I have many co-workers who are staunch atheists. Today, I made a mention of LDS individuals rejecting traditional trappings of Christianity. This turned into a really stupid argument over the definition of ""Christian,"" in which I argued that we should use definitions from tradition and one coworker argued for the Merriam-Webster dictionary. (Not that it's entirely relevant, but I said that LDS are going okay to call themselves Christians, but they aren't in light of basic theological differences.) In response to my argument from tradition, another co-worker said that the entirety of the Christian faith was invented at the Council of Nicea. I got really frustrated with this, because it's just an awful thing to say. I said that I wasn't willing to continue the argument and we moved on.

We've been able to lightly discuss religion without issues in the past, so I can't believe this argument became so heated. I also can't believe that my coworker thinks Constantine invented Christianity, because that's just so, so wrong. As we head into Halloween, Advent, and Christmas, I'm worried that anything might spark a dangerous disagreement in our department.

"A Message of Peace and Love Below is a message that was written by a man that wishes to remain anonymous because of the consequences of people knowing his identity, but the words were inspired by God.

""**It is written, so shall it be.**

*Ways of things you should not know until End Times*

My purpose is healing, My purpose is love.  But war is inevitable.  As long as you have had the perfect and divine Holy Word of your Lord Jesus Christ you have failed to act, so I bring you a new Word.  Even though the Bible is written, nothing is set in stone.  Christian blood will hold the Bible prophecies true.  A harsh divine requirement for the Great End.  Sin in the Great End will sum up to a distraction.  A distraction from God’s way.  You are beautifully and wonderfully made for My purpose, not for your own selfish pride.  The way we have to get back to in order to feed the hungry and poor and old alike.

You do not listen to My voice when I speak and My wrath cometh.

We have to get back to a place where we feed the hungry and love the poor and old alike.  God is tired of answering prayers for things Christians should have been taking care of for centuries.  If my servants walk these lands, then why do people suffer?  They suffer, because you wish to secure free time!  And that is exactly why it is coming to an end.

When a spirit wishes to visit this world the Holy Spirit must hold their hand because even in the next life He is the light in the darkness and He will still take you to what your heart desires.

The ones you love lose the ability to visit you when your heart is not in a situation that is ready for the Holy Spirit to latch on to.

The reason for this being that the Holy Spirit and God have the same traits so they react to sin in the same way the Holy spirit can’t touch it and God can’t look on it so if your soul is covered in too much sin the Holy Spirit can not hold on to you and He is sad because He loves you so much that He doesn’t wish to let go but He must because of the divine mechanisms that God has set in place in all His holy power and wisdom to keep the universe and this world in balance.

When you lose your mother and father their soul is a left and right energy of your body.  The hole in your life that God needs to fill is smaller when your parents live and breathe.

As you lose them you lose their batteries, then your emptiness is even more but this is meant to put on the speed and understanding that you need God to complete you in your life as He will walk in and fill that entire void.

He has set many unseen divine mechanisms in place that automatically tick and tock like a clock in rhythm that is so well planned and thought out in love that we can’t fathom it.

The reason for this being that God can do anything but He spends the majority of His time and energy solely focused on you and your every need and nuance with a love you can’t understand.  So much so that it takes energy for Him, a being without limit, is exhausted from how much you are loved.

But you must be ready to receive His blessing and unfortunately sometimes He has to wait a long time to see what He needs.  So that he may give you the desires of your heart.

We live in a time where we don’t have any left and God is going to pour out His spirit like never before on the faithful and just.  But a great war between good and evil is coming, but God has been raising His army to fight men in love with the devil and all his worldly things.

Blood will be spilt and vigilance is needed in all things as the devil needs but one moment to land his death blow.

Good men who crave peace must learn the ways of war to stop the evil that is coming.  God has sent His son to walk this earthly form in the past, during this time He showed the world how to change for always and the better, but we have lost our way as the devil has more treats then ever to make God’s people soft and out of touch with others and the lessons and revelations He wishes to show you day and night.

We must educate the people on real nutrition and get off your butt to use the body God gave you.

We have to start a campaign of real education and love in this world with less emphasis on prescriptions and more emphasis on wisdom, the wisdom to understand that amazing body I gifted you with requires nutrition every day.

He spends energy on loving us.  All of our good life amounts to a *pure* that fills a golden cup on a golden scale.  He drinks of this cup and the more full it is the more He is refreshed, replenished.  If He pours all His love energy into you and gets very little back, that is when your life is out of balance.

Your soul knows it’s own beginning and end, but the journey and decisions rest on your heart.  You have been away from Me so long that you have forgotten the knowledge of your ancestors.  As those who allow the Holy Spirit to enter their body, heart, and mind will be completed and granted with the knowledge, peace, and wisdom that passes all understanding.  

You have been taught that the many blessings I have bestowed upon man are somehow evil.  Sex was meant to ease your soul and connect you to the one soul I have for you.  I bring this person to many of you in life, and you let your own sin or pride stand in the way of loving your akin soul unconditionally.  This is why many of you live in misery.  Your own sin keeps you from the many blessings I have for you all.  When you and the one I have for you decide it is time for love, you must lock eyes and never look away, as the eyes are gateways to the soul.  You must shower the one that completes you in words in love and affection while holding their body with the passion that this may be the last you meet.

This knowledge has always been in you, and this is one of the many things I wish to reveal now as unfortunately this has become knowledge of the angels until this day.

Many of you in My house have mused why the battle of good and evil takes place if I am who I say I am.  Though I do not enjoy your lack of faith it is time to grant you knowledge of many things.

The devil understands things you do not such as My love for you is My greatest weakness and the only place a coward can strike.  He toils in the world of man so that he can pluck you from the Holy Spirit’s arms.  To which I feel a thousand sadnesses for each one of you that I lose to the prince of the air.  I only grant man with four sadnesses in his life to test and shape his life into what I need it to be for the glory of My kingdom.  Those are the loss of your mother and father, the loss of your soulmate, or the loss of a child.  So the devil in all his rage and glory amounts to a child poking a stick at his father for which he will be corrected and punished for all of time.  Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord thy God.  My vengeance is for the enemies of My children.  

The message should be clear, you are loved beyond all measure of understanding.  Knowledge and wisdom are God’s greatest assets He bestows on the faithful and the just.  Faithful and just does not mean perfect and clean.  Most of the time God’s greatest assets for His glory come from what the world sees as broken and damned.  The broken and the poor can rise from nothing with the power of Christ.  

My messengers have always been questioned and unfortunately because of fear and the devil’s ways martyred in My name.  The one I bring to you now will suffer no different fate.  The *how* and *who* of how he will die has already been revealed to him.  I can not reveal to him who the antichrist is, but he knows that the man who kills him is in leagues with him.  I have instructed a man of great power and capable of great violence to be the most loving and gentle among you.  He will be granted a divinity as long as he never strikes down another man, but do not muse is he Christ?  For in his humility he understands he is nothing but a footstool of Christ.  A footprint of how God wishes His children to live.  Though he is far from perfect he loves God first.  He still will struggle with his flesh, but that is My wish in this time.  For you to see that God can use anyone with the right heart for the glory and kingdom of God.  The ones that question Me the most, already know Me more then they can believe.  

I am apart of you all, I am the energy to your soul, and you are the energy of Mine.  I am the other side of the mirror when your own eyes try to get a glimpse of your soul.  You will find Me waiting to love you and show you peace.  As I complete you with the last piece you will ever need.  Your lives are not a set track, I have picked the best path for you in all My love and infinite wisdom, but even if you don’t make it there I still love you just the same.  The devil is in the worry.

In life I have set many divine mechanisms in place to keep balance in the universe. Most of you call the largest one, karma, that is grand enough I can not truly hide it from your soul.  As you are born with the knowledge it exists.  Which is why you named it what you did.  

You are chose to do nothing in this world.  I give ability and opportunities, you make decisions, and there are consequences.  I have made life into a beautiful symmetry of motion and emotion.  I give every man four sadnesses in his life, but to keep balance I give you four attributes to combat them.  They are: strength, honor, wisdom, and love.  If you love God and live by these principles, you will find favor in the Lord.  

It took 7 men of power and wisdom who loved an unfortunate soul, to create a man capable of being the footstool of Christ.  In this these 7 men will have their own faith tested and molded from the rise of their pupil onto a path only 2 men since the beginning of man have been asked to do.  In his humility it even tortures his soul to write these words.  As he does not feel worthy, but that is exactly why he is.  This is the first of many hardships to come for him.  The second being the folly of everyone he ever selflessly cared for, loved, and gave his all to shunning him out of dealing with my divine work.  As this task is a torture on his soul, they will turn their back out of their own fear and lack of knowledge and love for the Lord thy God.  This martyr has cried out to the Lord thy God in a way that has not been heard for centuries.  For though he can not even be compared to the holy and divine name of Jesus Christ, he must walk His path of pain and understanding.  But make no mistake he can fall if good men of God do not rise to protect him.

Praising God is over, the time to work for Christ is now.

He is tired of hearing what He has done for you, and He wishes to watch you do for others as you have been commanded the entire time.

Few of you believe this is the way and you find the people that live as I need, even among the church as it stands now they are a different people among you and you must listen to their words because they are My hand and they’re here to prepare you for a physical and spiritual warfare.

You’re more concerned with the price tag on your car and your clothes then you are with the value of the strength of your soul and your heart, and understand you are lost even though you think in your heart you are a Christian right now.  You are babies compared to the men I give you now and this is why I need you to trust in the things they say.""",Christianity,t3_dixer8
"Please tell me what you think of my story idea from a christian perspective. Criticism welcomed! Just felt the urge to post here as I'd like your opinions and feedback on this.

This would be a historical fantasy. It focuses on an inuit teenage girl with depression. Feels suicidal and one day goes out into a northern lights storm and gets superpowers. Her people are fighting an ever losing battle against the vikings and she considers herself the only one who can turn the tide in war. So she intervenes and helps her people by fighting with them and they begin to win. In the process she begins to overcome her depression and feels like she wants to live again. Though one day in battle she injures herself with a misplaced bolt of lightning (that's one of her powers). So she is physically very unable to move and the vikings begin to win again. In desparation  she must find a way to help her people and it ends in sacrifice. Her giving up her life as to create eternal winter. Still ironing out details so don't know exactly how this works but anyway it drives the vikings away and it means that her people can live in peace. We find out that this girl made a pact with an inuit deity to always provide food so her people would never starve.

So what I'd like to know - does this seem sinful to write? because a) its about another culture which believed in shamanism (and spirits)  and b) has magic and other gods

"You can't be a follower of Jesus and not live a sacrificial life. If your life feels 'easy', there's a chance that you are in control of your life. Just a reminder that Christians are called to love with sacrificial love that defies logic at times. If you want to follow Jesus, you need to be willing to give up every aspect of your life to him and hold nothing back. Jesus said that you need to hate your mother, father, and your own life if you actually want to follow him.


If you are looking for a comfortable and easy life, look elsewhere. Those who have been given a lot of faith also are expected to live and give sacrificially. Lukewarm Christians are have the worst of both worlds.

"Should we be afraid of God? For much of my Christian life, I was afraid of God and I taught that we should be afraid. I also taught that God = Love, but that if you're not in right standing with God, you should be terrified of God. I think that's pretty common in Christian circles.

My friend and I looked at the OT conception of fear of God and have found that it's different that we've thought about it before. To summarize, it's more about God being different and dangerous (in the way a nuclear reactor is dangerous), and not out to get us if we aren't X, Y and Z. This is why there are laws (think ""rules"") around approaching God, just like there are rules and guidelines around any dangerous thing we contact in our day to day lives. We're not saying you have to think this about God, but that the biblical writers likely did. Reading the ""fear"" passages in the OT make a lot more sense with this mindset. Also, this might help you if you've been caught up in a fear-based approach to God because of things you read in the bible that seem to be said God could destroy you if you're not Z, Y, and Z.

I watched videos of other people’s encounter with Jesus. I once envied a person in prison who found Jesus and was radically changed. And here I was, still in sin. Then I decided to get baptized out of my own will. I repented once again, then came out of water. I felt nothing different.

"An update about my scenario and more about my brother. For context on the scenario, school had just started, I needed help focusing on fixing the issues I have with organization, depression, and forgetfulness. My moms friend lost his house, my dad was dealing with personal issues, our lives were an overall mess. On the one hand, that’s not changed much. My grades are horrid, my dad is still having many problems, my moms friend still doesn’t have a home, everything is still the same basically. We’ve dealt with scenarios like this before, like the 2 years my mom went through college. However, this time is different than the others. I usually keep shut about what’s causing my problems and solutions (mainly because I think I’ll be in trouble if I acknowledge them) but this time, I’m openly working to fix these issues. I don’t know if it was because I chose to find prayers from god, or what did cause it, but I’m being openly honest about everything. We are solving it. This may be the end of our issues. My brother had many anger issues over the past few years, the worst point being a few years ago when he threatened me with a knife. That’s changed. When he does get mad, he yells a little louder than normal at worst, and tries to find a solution at best. Our scenario is improving. God or not, the people on this sub have been part of our improvement. You gave me emotional support and advice. The mods have helped me deal with those who wish to bring me trouble, you’ve all given me advice on how to be a better brother, and most of all, you’ve all given me a community I can trust to reveal my life to. I’m mostly secretive about my life and thoughts, especially on Reddit, but you all have surpassed my expectations and have been more than welcome to talk about my life. From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank each and every one of you. I came here first as a salty 13 year old atheist around a year ago looking to troll stupid Christians. You showed me the error of my ways, and improved my life in more ways than one. Give yourself a pat on the back for helping me with all this and others with their issues.

On to the second topic, my little brother. The one I’ve posted about here before. The one who wanted to stab me with a knife. He has reformed since that incident. At this point, he isn’t looking up to me, I look up to him. He may seem rude and cruel on the surface, but he is the kindest person I know by far. He loves cookies from a local store near us. Back in April (autism awareness month, which is quite important since he has autism) he said to our mom he wanted to share this love of them to his whole school. She laughed it off and continued with her day. Then he said he was serious. He and our mom went and bought cookies for his entire school of 600. I helped pass out the cookies. That’s when I realized how good of a person he was. There are many other examples of how good a brother and a person he is. If you want to know about them, please ask.

"Coming back to God This is a bit long so bare with me. My story revolves around a couple of lyrics I’d like to share with you. These lyrics are words that Ive found hard to listen to; “I am finding out that maybe I was wrong” and “I am nothing now, and it’s been so long.” 

It’s Paramore lyrics from an older song of theirs called “My Heart.” The song is about God, and how they’d be nothing without Him. Every time I hear that song it makes me cry bc I feel as if the words are coming straight from my own heart. I grew up Catholic and I practiced my faith, I also grew up loving Paramore, it was when I strayed away from my faith that song became painful to me. 

Just the other week that song just kept dwelling on  me more than ever before and I decided to go back to church. I went to a huge nondenominational church and the service was about playing the soundtrack to your life. To summarize it, the pastor mentioned how songs about your faith help improve your faith, that it’s important to sing with your heart and soul and to REJOICE and heaven will be singing right back with you. 

“Sing us a song, and we’ll sing it back to you. We could sing our own but what would it be without you.” That is the chorus to My Heart. 

That service brought me to tears, that a song about God brought me back to church only to hear the pastor talk about how important songs about your faith are. It seems small, but that message felt like I was the only person in that room and God sent that message directly to me.

I believe in God and I want to rebuild my relationship with him. This is a new journey for me and I’m not sure where to begin but I know prayer and church are a few steps in the right direction.

"Never felt God Delete if not allowed. Forgive me in advance, I'm not great at explaining things, and I'm not trying to start problems. Simply put, I've never truly felt the presence of god in my life. I had somewhat of a religious upbringing, though much more relaxed than some others here. Ive attended different denominations of churches (Methodist, Baptist, Catholic). I think I truly did believe when I was much younger. But I never once feel drawn to it. No joy in my heart. It just felt like something expected of me. As I got older, around my teenage years, it just didnt make sense to me anymore. It felt like all it was was a bunch of rules I had to follow or suffer for eternity. No love for a for a heavenly father, nothing. That feeling, along with other life circumstances, sent me into a spiral or depression that continues to this day. I dont know what to believe in anymore. Again, I'm sorry if this is hard to understand, I'm just looking for some perspective.

"Why did Jesus say this? (Matthew 5:17-19) ""Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished"" - Matthew 5:17-18

I understand that generally speaking, Christians believe we are not under Old Testament Law. The Bible states that we are not several times.

So why did Jesus say that he did not come to abolish the Law? By fulfilling the Law he essentially gets rid of it. And even if that part is a matter of semantics, Jesus clearly states in the next part that ""not the smallest letter"" or ""the least stroke of a pen"" will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished and heaven and earth disappear - neither of which has happened yet. So are we still under Old Testament Law? Why would Jesus say this?

""Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven"" - Matthew 5:19

Are Christians setting themselves up to be called least in the kingdom of heaven by setting aside the commands of the Law? This verse seems to very directly say so.

"Please please please pray for my friend I met my best friend 8 years ago playing a video game. I've been through everything with her and we're such good friends. She doesn't know God, and I pray for her every day at 2:00. I think God has promised me that she will be a Christian one day, so I have faith. 

Today she told me about something she's been doing that is morally wrong. She recognizes it herself that it's wrong but she refuses to stop. I'm not an emotional guy. I've never cried, not because I have to be ""macho"" but because I've just never felt the need to. I had a conversation with her tonight and God weighed down my heart so much it felt like a ton of bricks. I spent 20 minutes crying and praying for her. I didn't know what to say, but words kept flowing. The words that came out of my mouth most was ""She doesn't know what she's doing God."" Please just pray for her. I've never felt so convicted to pray for someone like that in my entire life. I don't know if I'm allowed to pray on someone else's behalf but she doesn't realize what she's doing. Someone has to do it if she won't.

"Struggling with sexuality, need help please Hi, I have never posted on reddit, but after having a mini crisis tonight I need to talk to someone and need help. Ever since I was around 7-8 I’ve been attracted to men ( I’m a guy). Now many years later I still am. I have also grown up my whole life in a Baptist church which believes that homosexuality is a sin. I have always loved being a Christian except for the fact that my life feels like a paradox. I know that the Bible teaches homosexuality is wrong, even ignoring the Old Testament, the New Testament teaches it too. And I’m starting to believe that I was born like this and can’t change it. I’ve tried praying about it, but nothing. Part of me thinks that God hasn’t responded to my prayers because I have had a porn problem/addiction since I’ve been young. I don’t know if I was born like this or I caused it myself though watching  so much porn. Anyways, I’ve always denied this and tried to live like a normal Christian. But deep down I know something is wrong. Either I can accept that I’m gay which means leaving Christianity;because why would God make me this way if it’s wrong. This would make me acknowledge that Christianity is not true and this scares me as I’m terrified of death without heaven. The other option is to keep living as I have been for the last ten years without telling anyone. I convince myself that I’m fine, but deep down I know that I’m not. I have read from some people that homosexuality is an urge (like the urge to lie) that can be repressed. But I’m honestly confused. I haven’t told my parents because it would crush them. They have never been positive about homosexuality, which I don’t blame them from as we come from a more conservative country and they grew up like that. I also don’t want to acknowledge that the Bible is wrong and therefore that god doesn’t exist. This would also devastate my parents, and myself. I wish I could just be straight and live a normal Christian life. I don’t know if I can change my sexuality. I need help. My pastor is also very close to my parents so I feel uncomfortable talking with him too. 
Thanks

PS also I don’t know how some people claim to be openly gay Christians. How do they ignore the parts in the New Testament that men that sleep with other men cannot enter heaven.

Carry On Kid is my all time fave album. I got a lot of great memories attached to the album. Like waking up at 4 in the morning during grade 12 camp waiting for the sunrise. Everyone was asleep and it was just me the cold breeze blowing on my face. No One Stays by title fight on my headphones. Than at 6 the sunrsie was coming up unlovable on playing as the sunrise was coming up. Knowing this was the last time I'll ever go to camp with my classmates. Knowing once the year was over all my friends will be gone living their lives. All of my friends went to different universities. I also listened to Carry On Kid after the campfire. It was late at night i was tired the sky looked super clear and everything was quiet except the sound of crickets and a train. I sat alone outside my tent looking at the stars Homebuilder playing quietly in the background. I was in tears because this was it this was my last camp and last time seeing my freinds I've known since grade 7. That night under the star lit sky i became a believer. During my grade I played melody save me during my grad cruise. I needed fresh air and went outside. I stood outside looking at the ocean. I couldn't believe I was graduating. Every time i went to camp I would wake up early and play COK. 

I also mentioned you guys during my school chapel. 

Also i remember listieng to COK during my grade 10 camp. We did a little camp out on an island. It was raining the night before and the rain was still coming down. I woke up early and everyone else was sleeping in the tent. I woke ealy and just slept in my sleeping bag playing COK and your like the sun. The next day we were back at the campsite. The next day I woke up early again because my friend wanted to see the sunrise. We sat at this bench looking at the sunrise watching the sun coming up. We just sat there in the silence listening to our songs. I was listieng to under soil and dirt, current will carry us and carry on kid and title fight. It was perfect. Listening to those albums take me back to those mornings. I even listened to COK before my first date with this girl I had a huge crush on. COK has been through the dark and best times of my life. Unlovable saved me from killing myself and there when i became a Christian. You guys made a huge impact on my life.

And I’ll see people come up with the most extreme answer ever, all based on feelings, or hear say. 

We have to recognize that sometimes people intend to trap us, when asking question. And sometimes people aren’t really looking for an answer. They just want to argue. 

Remember , if someone comes making a claim to you, it is THEIR burden to prove their stance, not yours to refute it.

And if you don’t know, just say it. We have to remember people are always watching/listening . We don’t want to turn someone off who maybe have been on the fence, because we start making up folly statements, or turn irrational.

Are job is to plant the seed. We need to remember “Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience,” (Colossians‬ ‭3:12‬ ‭ESV‬‬).

Is there a valid counter argument towards this that I've overlooked?

**TL;DR:** **If you are to ""love thy neighbor as thyself"" if your suffering causes others pain, should you not allow for euthanasia?**

My paragraph discussing this if you're interested or otherwise confused:

  

&gt;The second category of Christian teachings towards euthanasia is that to euthanize is to harm those around us. As Jesus said “And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/submit#_ftn1) This is a relatively simple concept to grasp on face value. If you choose death due to age then your death could harm your friends, family and especially children. Ironically for some seeing people in pain and suffering hurts them deeply. So therefore according to the teaching “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself” should we not euthanize those we are so close to death it causes pain to those dearest to them?

"I don’t want to date now, but I’m afraid I’m losing opportunities About me: I’m a twenty-four and male. I’m Baptist and tend to be old fashioned and traditional. Most people in my church are married by their early 20s. I’ve never had a girlfriend because I’ve never tried. Some day I’d like a wife, but not anytime soon. Right now I’m enjoying my faith and parents and hobbies. And honestly, I’m not man enough yet nor have sufficient income to be married.

Preferably I’d like to wait 10+ years to start dating but that would put me in my mid 30s. A lot of single women that age are going to be divorced and/or have kids. And I strongly prefer to marry a virgin. I wouldn’t consider marrying a divorced woman because that’s adultery in most cases. Also, I think it’d be kind of sad to miss out on dating a girl in her early 20s because I think that’s the age where most women peak physically. I’m not looking for premarital sex, just it’d be nice to experience dating a woman in her prime.

Do y’all have any advice here? I want a girl that doesn’t have a long sexual and/ or romantic past. But I want to wait about 10 years and there won’t be many 35 year old virgin women out there. That’s my fear. What should I do?",Christianity,t3_dijinb

"Do you question why bad things happen in your life? I can speak for myself when I say that I question the bad things that happen in my life.  Maybe you can relate.  Most of the time, if you ask church clergy why these things happen, they will tell you to stop questioning, and just trust in God's plan. 

I had trouble with this, because all I want is to be able to understand.  I always felt guilty for questioning.  I always felt like I was sinning and being a rotten apple for questioning.  But I wanted answers.   I started talking with God and asking for help.  It seemed like some time had passed without any response, then the other night, I decided to watch Mel Gibson's 'The Passion of Christ' for the second time, and something miraculous happened.  I got the response I was waiting for.  

(Note:  I have read the entire King James Version of the Bible, and watched nearly every movie regarding Jesus and the Bible)

The message I recieved was right in front of my face this entire time, and I didn't even realize it.  Most people don't.  I've yet to hear anyone with this point of view.  

As the movie progressed, I noticed this at the point where Jesus was being crucified.  Jesus cried out,""My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken Me"" (Matthew 27:46 &amp; Mark 15:34)?  Then Jesus commanded His spirit into God's hands (Luke 23:46).  

Point being, even Jesus, in His darkest hours questioned why this was happening to Him.  Yet He still trusted God's plan by commanding His spirit into God's hands, and not telling God that He was wrong.  

I remembered another couple pieces of scripture in that very moment of understanding:

   Proverbs 2:6 King James Version (KJV)
6 For the Lord giveth wisdom: out of his mouth   cometh knowledge and understanding.

   James 1:5 King James Version (KJV)
5 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

Personally, I came to the conclusion that it is ok to ask why things are the way they are, but it is absolutely crucial to remain faithful to God's plan.    I came to the conclusion that it is ok to ask why things are bad, just as long as you do not tell God that He is wrong.  We are instructed to ask for wisdom when we are lacking.  We are also instructed to have faith in God's plan.

God will save whosoever believes that Jesus Christ (God in flesh) died for their sins was buried and rose from the dead, apart from their good works and religious sacraments.

God will save you just as you are, by grace through faith alone in Jesus Christ!

Why not trust Jesus Christ alone as your savior and only means of salvation today, and receive God‘s free gift of everlasting life this very moment!

"Once was lost but now I’m found. 
At the start of May this year I downloaded the YouVersion Bible app and started reading the KJV Bible. All my life I have been around Christianity but as my nuclear family has never been religious or attended church I personally had to seek out what I believe is true. In middle school I would say I defined myself as an atheist, I hated myself and did not want to be accountable to a higher power. In high school I started to believe in a basic God-like being that had some control over individuals life’s. And now as a married young adult I realized that the Lord as always been with me and stayed with me threw all my faults and transgressions. I found out I was pregnant with my son in December of 2018, having a child has made me understand God’s love. Having a child I realize all the dangers of the world and I know that everyone needs and deserves God’s love. As I read the scriptures and pray to God I understand more and more, and I can apply God’s wisdom to every situation. As I’ve transitioned into Christianity I have sought out biblical literature and media to learn from other Christians. The most important thing I have come across is to learn to listen to “Gods prompting.” 1 Kings 19 verse 12 says 

“And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.” 

When asking the Lord for wisdom do not expect an immediate answer, do not except a loud booming voice to give you the answer, in every decision the Lord’s answer will come first you just need to listen for his still small voice. I ask as you go threw your day and make choices no matter how small or large listen to that first instinct, that is the Lord’s still small voice. The path God has for you is not a straight road, I believe it is a maze with “left and right” choices but in the end one final destination. I praise you Lord for protecting me and teaching me threw the difficult and dangerous times in my life. I thank you Lord for your son who has allowed me to have a relationship with you. I will praise you Lord with all thine heart, and lean not on thine own understanding.",Christianity,t3_die820

I'm about to be graphic. There's something just kinky about watching 2 guys have sex, and continuous switching roles. It's rather forbidden. I especially like it when there there's some anime involved.

I've also always dreamed about getting pegged by a big man while he slaps my ass.

Initially, I was watching straight porn, but it always felt very generic. Then I moved onto femboys, then tranny, and now gay porn. Now I'm solely attracted to gay porn, man on man. What the fuck is wrong with me? It'll only get worse.

"New to this (sort of). What do I do next? I am a 23 year old american male born and raised in the south. My father was raised southern baptist, my mother was raised Methodist. When I was a child, we went to a baptist church until one day we stopped going there and became regulars at a non denominational church. If I remember correctly, my father had an issue with the baptist preacher's interpretation of the Word which is why we found a new church. We moved to a new state when I was 12 and we hopped around churches until my parents found a mega church in our new city. It was a great church that emphasized community and my parents found a new love for Jesus because of this church, but I always thought it felt a little culty to be honest. On top of that I went to a Catholic high school because the public schools where we lived weren't the best. I am very thankful for the education I received, but it confused my young mind going from attending a Baptist church to attending a mega church to receiving a Catholic education. I have always been very interested in religion and I believe I had a close relationship with God at one point in my childhood, but as time went on I lost my faith. I don't know whether to attribute this loss of faith to laziness, ignorance, arrogance, or secular pressures, but it happened and I became a firm atheist before graduating high school. For the last 5 years I have lived a secular life and denied the existence of God. I have done what I wanted to do, sinned, done drugs, drank too much, and put myself before everyone else in my life. I lied my way through relationships, took advantage of others along the way, and became the kind of person I wish I had never become. 

In the last 18 months, however, my life began changing for the better. Everything started to turn around for me and I slowly became accepting of the idea that there is something bigger than myself out there. I met the love of my life and I have consciously tried changing my ways since she came into my life. I am trying to be the honest, compassionate, and loving man that I know I am supposed to be. In the last 6 months I have been researching Christianity again and I feel that my next step is to let Jesus back into my heart, but I don't know where to begin. Between my baptist childhood, mega church teenage years, and Catholic education, I don't know what to believe. 

My fiancee is in a similar position as me (grew up Christian, became an atheist, and has recently expressed a new-found curiosity about the Christian faith). I feel that her curiosity is an answered prayer of sorts because I was concerned with what she would think if I told her I wanted to go back to church, but one day recently she said she thinks it would be a good idea if we went to church. Its almost like God is trying to tell me what I need to do, but I don't know what to do. My parents have a wonderful relationship with God, but they moved again and are no longer members of a church. They do their own Bible study at home because they haven't found a church they enjoy in their new city. 

I'm confused because I don't know what to do.. Do I find a big church in my area and try to fit in? Do I find a home in the Catholic Church? Or do I strive for a personal relationship with God and forego church altogether?

All I know is I want to make a change for the better. I want to be the man God created me to be. I just don't know where to begin, and I feel so overwhelmed because of all the different churches out there.

"How would you define being a follower of christ is? This is something that reallllllly gets me. I guess the broadest is that once someone accepts Jesus as their saviour, trust in the authority of the Bible and believe in the Holy Trinity, they're Christian.



Now, after that, what? There are many sins (we can also call them signals and signs for the purpose of the convo) that people like to throw in when it comes to the Christian faith, like: any sexual activity outside man/woman marriage (like pre-marital sex, adultery, re-marriage, porn, gay marriage etc), cussing, drinking, smoking, drugs, stance on LGBTQ+ and abortion are the most common.



Let's take one sin for example: porn



1. Adam (fictional character) watched porn once and repented
2. Adam watched porn once and didnt repent but never continues (doesnt think its wrong camp but he just didnt like it)
3. Adam never watched porn but doesnt think its wrong either
3. Adam watched porn, repented, knows it's wrong, but keep falling into it because he doesnt set good boundaries or have accountability, but he repents every time
4. Adam watched porn, repented, knows its wrong, sets good boundaries, but still fails, and then repents
5. Adam watches porn, no repentance, no action change



For these cases, who is Christian and who is not?



Let's take another case with multitudes of sins:



1. Adam watches porn, repents, but keeps failing. He doesnt do any of the other sins above (such as drinking, cussing etc)
2. Adam doesnt watch porn, but does all of the above 
3. Adam doesnt do any of the above, but also dont believe they are wrong
4. Adam does all of the above because he doesnt believe they're wrong
5. Adam does some and doesnt do some



For these cases, who is Christian and who is not?



Also, does it matter if we categorize someone as Christian or not? Where does the line lie when it comes to Faith vs works? 


What about non-obvious sins like gluttony, hatred, narrow-mindedness, irresponsibility, disrespect to ones parents, not loving God with all of our heart, mind, soul and body, pride, stingyness, lust, jealousy etc? Not going to church? Not having read the Bible in 10 days, 2 months, 1 year, 10 years?

"The Catholic Church vs Orthodoxy Hello.

Please sorry for my english.

My name is Constantine.

I was born in Orthodox Christianity. However, over time, I began to gravitate toward other faiths.

I would like to go to the Catholic, but there are things that I do not understand.

I would like to get a theological education, but the choice of denomination to do before.

I ask you to guide me to the right path.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The infallibility of the Pope.

&amp;#x200B;

According to the teachings of the Catholic idea of ​​papal primacy is as follows: ""The primacy of the Apostle Peter and his infallibility in matters of faith, the Lord promised him, passed to his successor - the Bishop of Rome. The apostle Peter and his successor, Bishop of Rome, there is the Catholic belief that the rock on which the Church is built. ""

Thus Catholics refer to the words of Jesus Christ, the Apostle Peter said in the Gospel:

And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” Matthew 16.18-19.

But papal infallibility dogma was adopted at the First Vatican Council in 1869-1870, respectively. In fact, it came first.

For the first time the Pope refers to its succession from the Apostle Peter, ""which adopted all bases of the Church"" in a dispute about the systems cross, heretics at Cyprian. Then Pope Stephen began to demand from the African Church to act on Roman practice. In 255 at the Council of Carthage in the decision not to recognize the baptism of heretics and keep existing practices in Africa. On hearing this, the Pope writes in Carthage and again requires taking Novatians only through repentance and of Cyprian of Carthage calls the false Christ, false apostle, wicked slave.

In a letter sent to the Byzantine Empire in September 865 years, Pope Nicholas argued that the judge Ignatius could not subordinate bishops, that the right to trial patriarchs belongs only to the Holy See, that without the Pope consent invalid and decisions of the councils and the pope, as the successor of the Apostle Peter It has power over the whole Church.

Question about the actions of Pope Nicholas, Photius decided to bring to all Churches forum. Council was held in Constantinople in the summer of 867. His acts have not been preserved. We only know that it was a very large cathedral, and he condemned Pope Nicholas. It seems that at this council was condemned by the addition of the word Filioque to the Creed.

The Church ""is not infallible because that is holy, and because it has a supreme high priest"", through which the Spirit of God always works when needed.

At the moment, I believe that the dogma of the infallibility of the Pope is an attempt to de facto monarchy of the entire Catholic Church. And Dad can act according to their own convictions.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Filioque.

&amp;#x200B;

Nicene Creed introduced by the Second Ecumenical Council in 381, was approved at the IV Ecumenical Council in 451.

In the original version of the Creed filioque did not exist.

Latin Fathers of the Church has traditionally taught on the participation of the Son in the procession of the Spirit, or in progress, this doctrine was later dogmatized alongside local councils and the dogmatic letters papal throne at the turn of the Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages.

Tertullian holds a special place in the history of Latin Trinitarian theology, as he entered the Latin formula. una substantia (one substance) and Latin. tres personae (three persons) in the language of Latin theology, and in the text of Tertullian is mentioned about participation of the Son in the procession of the Spirit:

Spirit has no other source other than the Father through the Son.

Hilary of Poitiers, traditionally referred to as the ""Athanasius of the West"", commenting on the fragment of the Gospel of John, details the relationship of the Father and the Son in the procession of the Spirit:

If you believe that there is a difference between receiving from the Son and the place (procedere) from the Father, there is no doubt that the taking of the Son and to the Father - the same thing. Your Holy Spirit is, of Thee through Him (the Son), even though the mind does not comprehend, but nevertheless refrained conscience.

Ambrose in his treatise ""On the Holy Spirit"" (. Ca 381) writes about the procession of the Spirit from the Father and the Son:

Also, the Holy Spirit, proceeding from the Father and the Son, does not separate any of the Father or the Son.

in Catholic theology, it was recognized that the Filioque in the Creed is the later insertion of the Latin theologians, which has never existed in the original Creed, drawn up in the Greek language. The addition of the Filioque into the Creed according to the Catholic Church, set out in the Pope bull Eugenius IV of July 6, 1439 at the Council of Florence, the Filioque - this explanatory word (Latin explicationem verborum.), Added to the Latin translation of the Nicene-Constantinople Creed, adopted by the Roman Church in the XI century in the doctrine of the Trinity.

However, despite the recognition of the Catholic Church of the late insertion of the Filioque, they continue to use it in the Creed.

I would add that the actual use of the filioque in the Creed began in the troubled times of 10 early 11th centuries, when the Popes were not elected, but appointed.

Catholics, remember Marozia (domna senatrix).

Emperor Henry II made the Pope Benedict VIII in turn Filioque. With the addition of this Creed was sung in 1014 at the coronation of Henry.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Split.

&amp;#x200B;

The Church of Rome shortly before the split (1045-1047) was at the same time three of the Pope (Benedict IX, Sylvester III and Gregory VI). This is also complicated by the case of reunification. On Sutriyskom Cathedral (1046) at the request of Henry III, all three popes were declared deposed. With the support of the Roman Emperor at the department established (in 1049) his relative - Leo IX to finish the job separation.

And here I heard two versions of the division:

Catholics often talk about the closure of the Latin churches in Constantinople in 1053 and that sokellary Patriarch Michael Cerularius ejected from the Shrine Latin sacred gifts and stomped their feet.

Point of view, most of the Orthodox that Michael Cerularius began to go against the Pope. For this reason, Pope Leo IX sent a legate to Constantinople, headed by Humbert.

""They did not tell me even the usual greetings, - says Mikhail Patriarch of Antioch - not favored to make the most simple bow, there was not the slightest sign of respect ... All in all, surprising that they every repeat: we de came here not to you have to learn, but to teach you, you get to take our dogmas. ""

I believe that the insertion of the Filioque in the Creed, East-West Schism in 1054 there past time mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

My final question is whether we can fix the mistakes of the past? Is it possible to undo some past Cathedrals theoretically?

"The Concept of Eternity. I want to ask you what you think about the idea of living forever. We all know that in Christian belief, you either spend eternity in heaven or hell, based on judgement from the supreme being. The idea of spending eternity in heaven sounds comforting at first. But have you actually thought about the idea of living forever?

More time is always something I desire, but maybe eternity would be too much time. The thought of never dying, existing for billions upon trillions of years, absolutely terrifies me. Being happy in a place called heaven sounds great, but I would want it to end eventually. One day I would just want to cease to exist and to slip out of consciousness forever in peace. Except that this is not an option. You're stuck there, no matter how bored you are of your own existence.

Now, I'd rather spend forever in a place called heaven rather than hell. But wouldn't it be just as unforgiving? Wouldn't it be just as much of a punishment? Think about it.

I don’t necessarily agree with all of the teachings in the Corpus Hermeticum, though I do find “ancient” teachings intriguing, and I like to understand all (or most) points of view in relation to spiritual and philosophical matters. 

[Some academics claim ](https://archive.org/stream/godsofegyptianso00budg#page/414/mode/2up) that Hermes was a Greek reconstruction of Thoth from the Egyptian pantheon. 

Some claim that Trismegistus was an amalgamation of various Egyptian and Greek philosophers. 

Ancient Christian writers, including Lactantius, Augustine, Giordano Bruno, Marsilio Ficino, Campanella, and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, considered Hermes Trismegistus to be a wise pagan prophet who foresaw the coming of Christianity. 

Jewish mysticism proposes that Hermes was a contemporary of Moses, which was also a popular view during the Renaissance. 

However, the Corpus Hermeticum has been found to be no older that *third century AD* — and subsequently, Renaissance Hermeticism collapsed. (Haanegraaff, W. J., New Age Religion and Western Culture, Brill, Leiden, New York, 1996, p 390)
According to (Yates Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition pp. 2–3):
 “they were certainly not written in remotest antiquity by an all wise Egyptian priest, as the Renaissance believed, but by various unknown authors, all probably Greeks, and they contain popular Greek philosophy of the period, a mixture of Platonism and Stoicism, combined with some Jewish and probably some Persian influences.”

Who was Hermes Trismegistus? Did he exist as a literal person, or is he an amalgamation of personalities? Is the Corpus Hermeticum a forgery—and Trismegistus a myth? Was Hermes a prophet?",Christianity,t3_dimar1

"The more I think about it, the more God just seems like everyone's abusive boyfriend Let's posit for the sake of argument that god truly does exist, and that letting go of religion isn't exactly the most pleasant of experiences.

I don't have much statistical evidence to back my second claim, but I don't feel like I'm pulling at any strings to make it. To add to that, in biblical texts, god is described as creating humans and perfecting their design and all that theological bullshit we're all acquainted with. 

If you accept these premises 

1. God created humans and their psychology 

2. Leaving religion is a semi-traumatic experience 

You come to the conclusion that, therefore, god created us in a way that, because of our psychology (existential dread, need for a community, etc.), we are dependent on him. 

Is that the god we would describe as omnibenevolent? ""love me more than anyone else or else I'll give you anxiety or depression, maybe both. And if you kill yourself because of it, then fuck you! To the lake of fire!"" 

God feels like he was ripped from a shittier version of twilight

There's also the whole gaslighting aspect of God. ""no it's not me that's at fault for burning you for eternity, it's your fault! You lead yourself there by being sinful! Honestly if you didn't love me this could've turned out so much better. I mean what's wrong with worshipping me your entire life? Jesus, if you weren't so blind to me your life could've been so much happier""

When you put it that way, does it not seem like textbook gaslighting? The deflection of whose fault it is, the lying, making you doubt your own morality.

But I held my tongue. Conversation continues and this girl asks if they’ve heard of Tim Hawkins. Then they start singing “Nobody loves the little children” (A parody of Atheists sung to a worship song) They sing the whole thing through. I literally want to explode by now. 

After that, someone asked me an experience I had with a Christian Cult and how it affected/affects me today. 

After I told the story of how I got out, I started to explain my process of becoming an Atheist. 

I was mobbed by the other Christians in the room asking me to clarify certain things, provide evidence, tell me why I’m wrong, I calmly do my best to explain my thought process and why the historical errors, translation errors, and theological issues between denominations leads me to believe that either the Christian god doesn’t exist, or that he is a horrible communicator. 

They eventually get super mad at me. They start to tell me that I’m “Attacking them” and that “They were just there to sing worship songs and I butted in and round everything”

Where is her Moral Barometer? ,atheism,t3_dlclha
"Countering the Argument: No morals without religion I have heard many religious people, namely Christians, argue in support of their religion on the basis that you cannot have morals without religion. They argue that the Bible (or other religious text) provides us with a framework for our morals. Further, the fear of hell, not reaching heaven, or other motivating aspects grounded in religion, motivate us to abide by these morals. 
However, as society has progressed, we have seen a shift away from many of the teachings of these religious texts and toward morals exhibiting a more liberating outlook on one's own personal freedoms. 
In this sense, it appears that it is our intrinsic nature that has guided us away from many moral teachings of religion.
Over the course of the last millennia, religion has faded and our values are becoming more liberating and better overall. 
Thus, it certainly seems that it is not religion that provides us with our morals, but (potentially) our nature as human beings that does, as we have progressed to recognize faults in many religious-based morals and replaced them with new, more liberating morals. 
While many fundamentalist still remain, most religious people are less extreme and their beliefs have deviated from their religious texts. These deviations are evidence that it is not religion that provides us with these morals. 

TL;DR religion does not provide us with and help us keep our morals; just look at the course of history: as religion is losing traction, our values as a society are becoming more liberating. Thus, it is our intrinsic nature that provides us with these liberating morals, which contradict many religious teachings and have caused society to replace these teachings with values intrinsically learned from the progression of our society.

"Need help/advice on breaking up with my Christian girlfriend. I'm sorry if this post is not well thought-out; I'm lost and confused and I have no idea what to do, just hoping to get this off my chest. A few months ago I started a relationship with my housemate. You often hear you should never shit where you eat, yet to my inexperienced teenage ears it meant nothing.

I knew I could never be in a relationship with a religious person, but after I met her, as we slowly fell in love, it didn't really matter to me. Not for some time, at least. We had the most amazing two months, but then problems started popping up.

She started talking about marriage and kids, about baptizing them and raising them strictly catholic. About converting me. She believes it's the right thing to do. I don't blame her, she believes she's helping me - the belief was indoctrinated into her. I told her her efforts are futile and I ignore all her conversion talk, however I could never lie to and indoctrinate my children and teach them to believe fairy tales.

There's also the problem of sexual intimacy between us. She believes that making love is wrong and sinful, and that it is only acceptable after marriage and for the purpose of procreation. I believe that it's a powerful expression of intimacy between two people who love each other and it's also something I would need to have in a long term relationship.

&amp;#x200B;

Complete incompatibility, big red flag, right? I know. But I'm not sure how I can break up.

The trouble is, we really do love each other, despite our differences. In all things besides religion we work out quite well. I've brought up the idea of a breakup to her several times but she says she will do ANYTHING just to be with me. I don't want her to change her values or beliefs for me. I told her I want her to live a happy life and that she ought to find someone else who's more suitable for her, someone she'll be compatible with. However she always freaks out at that idea and says she only wants me, that she would die or seriously hurt herself if she lost me. I'm aware she might be emotionally manipulating me but I don't think she is and I don't want to risk her well-being.

I love her and right now we're quite happy together. However I know I could never marry her or be in a long long term relationship with her. So why don't I break up now? Trouble is, we're housemates. We are students and we live right next door to each other. Like, 10 feet away. We also share the kitchen. There's no way around that - I'll be staying in this place until July 2020. Breaking up would make living here a living hell for both of us. So I was thinking we could be happy together until July, and then when we move to different apartments I'll break up. It feels morally wrong because I know she's hoping that we will end up together and I might be leading her on, but I feel it might be the least unhealthy option.

What would be the right thing to do here?? I'm young and inexperienced with relationships. I'm just trying or hoping to do the right thing. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",atheism,t3_dlbbzu
"An experience I know that my experience is a very casual experience, but this was a moment of great shock. But first: a little backstory. 

I am a university student living in New York. The past few years I've been listening to people such as Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, etc, speak out against religion. I've heard the testimony online about how the religious think that ""we're all sinners"" and we ""all deserve to go to hell"", which became quite usual to listen to (that's to say, you eventually expected them to say that). 

However my university has a lot of proselytisation. Nearly every night, or every couple of nights, you've got a lot of religious people passing out fliers for people to join their church, and it happens all throughout the semester (even during finals, lol). I receive (Even though I've never signed up for any of it) emails (presumably sent to everyone in my university) about the various religious groups, and I've usually deleted the emails and thrown out the fliers or politely decline to accept the flier. I do remember being approached by an old man who shouted at me ""YOUNG MAN, HERE, TAKE THIS"" (passes me a flier to join their church--&gt; I really should've kept it and gone). Anyways, this is a digression. 

However, one night I decided that I might as well go to one of the meetings. So I went (near the beginning of the semester), and it was your normal ""ice-breaker"" thing so that new people are acquainted with the other members. And so I try to sit as quietly as possible, not make much of a fuss, not try to be argumentative, be polite, that sort of thing. 

During the meeting, there were two things that shocked me:

1. As a speaker was introduced, the person introducing them demanded that god must speak through the upcoming speaker, and that we should listen with obedience. 
2. At one time, one of the speakers had said the following: ""we're all filthy, horrible sinners, and we really do not deserve the resurrection and the kindness Jesus has given to us, so we will obey him and God with all our heart"". 

There are several things to be amazed at (from my point of view).

1. The demand for a being higher than yourself to speak, as if you have the power to compel them to speak.
2. The hypocrisy, saying that you are below the entity whilst demanding that they speak through a person. 
3. That people actually believe that they are horrible and wicked people. 

At the end of the meeting, I was approached and asked by one of the group leaders where I am in terms of faith, and I replied that ""I dont particularly believe in the supernatural. I've tried to believe, but I haven't received any noticeable response"".

Note, I didn't use words like ""I am an atheist"", or anything like that. I tried to be as polite as I could, but the look she gave me was one as if I had just insulted a dear family member of hers and said something scandalous. She immediately backed away and went to talk with someone else. 

I'm not constructing this post for ""pity points"" or say that all christians are bad or anything like that. This was something that came to me as a shock, which I know, however mild it may sound (and plenty of people have far worse stories than I), this was something that shocked me.

"Does anybody else have to put up with “crocodile tears” from family members? Because I deal with that shit at pretty much every family gathering. The weird part? I was raised an atheist. I didn’t even know what a cross was until I was like 8 years old after my parents told me about it. The only hounding and backlash I receive comes from my Uber fundamentalist Aunt &amp; Uncle who genuinely believe I’m “broken” because of how my parents raised me. They don’t talk to my parents anymore but for some reason they think it’s a-ok to talk to me without my parents’ permission. My parents know they interact with me at family gatherings, but I think that if they actually heard the stuff they try to preach to me they would lose their shit and immediately go NC. I really don’t like family drama so I put up with their “holier than thou” drivel for as long as I can and then just walk away. Their main strategies are of course guilt tripping and overall hurt trying to play with my emotions/sympathy, hence the title. Things like “I feel like I’ve failed you”, “I’m just so concerned about where your soul will end up”, and of course “It’s not too late to see the light!” Lol. It’s mostly just this stuff on repeat, so them trying to come off as concerned and sad just comes off as a manipulative facade to me. I just sit there and nod along, occasionally saying “uh huh” or “yeah” just so they know I’m listening. And it’s not like I don’t listen to their arguments. I try to understand their point of view and how they feel about me being an atheist. They do the same thing to my two siblings as well. 

I don’t blame them for it, or even dislike them. They’re a product of their time. Both my Aunt &amp; Uncle are approaching 70. Obviously I don’t know what their upbringings were like, but just from interacting with them and hearing the crazy shit they spout I get the idea that they grew up extremely sheltered and indoctrinated into the faith, kind of like how I was indoctrinated I to atheism. Only difference is I wasn’t sheltered. I just hope that before they kick the bucket, they’re able to make peace with the fact that the family isn’t going to have one unified belief system and that’s ok.",atheism,t3_dl59do

"Children: Atheist or No Labels? So, all children are born atheist as it is impossible for them yet to even conceive of theism. However, some believe that this is making us(atheists) just as bad as the religious folk as we are doing precisely what we accuse them of doing by labeling children as being part of their religion. While I don’t take atheism as a religion(obviously), I can see the merit in the alternative viewpoint that children are just children and we shouldn’t be putting labels on them. 

Edit: No label meaning that they aren’t simply old enough to begin to form conclusions on religion as of yet, so their beliefs shouldn’t be categorized.

"A student ministry wilderness retreat to remember! Well we had a bit of an accident on last year's trip, not sure if you all heard about it. We were on our way up to the campsite for the student ministry wilderness retreat and hit a patch of ice on the service road. Well we started careening out of control and it got the point where I just couldn't keep the bus on the road so I threw my hands up towards the sky and said ""Lord Jesus take the wheel!"" And well I truly believe he did, but we still ended up flying off the road at about 55 mph and slammed into the ravine off the side of the road. But thank the lord only 5 students died on impact of that crash. Had to be a god thing that we didn't all die. The Lord works in mysterious ways I tell you. Any-who that put a bit of a damper on the retreat so we called it early last year but this year's retreat went off with out a hitch. Well almost, we did have that incident with the mountain lion. Let me tell you always take a head count after a hike in the woods! We had a young student, bout 15 get brutally eaten by a mountain lion this year. I remember having to tell the parents of that young boy how their son wouldn't be coming home since most of him was still digesting inside the mountain lion. Well as you can imagine they were devastated when I told them the news, but I told them I said, ""the Lord works in mysterious ways"". And you could see the realization of that message just wash over them. Well maybe not right away, they were still pretty upset but I know that the only thing that can help them in their grieving is to know that God saw fit for their little boy to be eaten by a mountain lion that day. Who knows maybe that mountain lion is a servant of god and has some greater purpose to fulfill, and maybe it was starving and they only way it would survive was to feast on the flesh of that boy.

"For the first time in my life, I showed an inkling of me doubting Islam to my parents. I trusted them and hoped they would have answers, so I went ahead and did it since I had what I believed to be a good amount of logic and reasoning on my hands. I found a very clear contradiction in the Quran. 

I received a 30 minute lecture on my bad attitude. 

Surprisingly, they weren’t mad at me, and were eager to teach me in a loving way. My father even said there was nothing wrong with asking questions. 

But then it got so fucked up, and my heart sank.

1- They told me that if I am learning about the religion, I am supposed to have the mindset that God is always right, and that if I find anything that indicates otherwise, *I* am the issue, and that I have to seek god’s guidance to eventually find the right answer. Basically, their *number one point* was that confirmation bias is a must. I literally said the words “confirmation bias”, and they said it was necessary and didn’t bother seeing anything wrong with it. 

2- I was told that even though there are things we cannot prove, I have to believe in it regardless. Again, I must always assume that god knows more than me. 

3- As for my contradiction, I was told that I’m never supposed to look at the Quran from a critical or even *neutral* perspective. Always pro perspective.

I told them that’s not how normal thinking was, but they told me that religion isn’t like science, and that I can never want to doubt anything... unless all my doubts turn out to be wrong. My parents literally work in medicine and business fields where you depend on rational thinking, then told me it’s not necessary for religion. That Satan is whispering thoughts in my head. They won’t let me finish a sentence without going ham on it.

This is.. a cult. I can never doubt, and I have no idea what’s in store for me if I let them know what I really think. They’re too far gone.

"Should I tell my parents I am an atheist? Some context: I am 17 year old high school senior and live in Texas. Since 4th grade, my parents have homeschooled me and have taught me all about Christianity. I used to be a Christian, but for the last two years I consider myself an atheist. In Fall 2020, I am going to college. This subreddit actually started my journey to atheism so thanks for that! :)

I want to tell them about my atheism sometime between after I turn 18 and before I go to college. I wanna tell them before I go to college so they don't expect me to go to church and things like that. I don't wanna live a lie and fake being a Christian. I also want to tell them before college so they know it wasn't college that changed me. It also seemed like a good time because it gives my parents time to think while I am away. Me being a Christian is everything to them so  I thought me being gone might give them time to ""heal"" from the bad news.

"Christians justifications for condemning sex before marriage. I was talking with some christian friends today and the topic of sex came out. There was this girl that was in a relationship for four years, and just now was ""considering"" the idea of having sex, because they will only be able to marry in 3 or 4 more years, and they just don't want to wait that long. Another girl said that she chose to wait for marriage and will never even consider having sex. I asked what is so bad about sex before marriage. She responded with ""it may lead to psychological and emotional problems, you can be infected with STDs, it's something special you should only share with your husband"" and other supposed harms. Whenever christians talk about sex before marriage them seem to think that everyone that does it must be some promiscuous person who likes to have orgies all of the time. I asked her again ""what if a couple have sex the day before their marriage? They'll not be promiscuous, they'll be doing it with their future partner, they'll not get random STDs, they'll not experience 'emotional problems' from promiscuity... is it still so bad?"".

"One in five Malaysian Muslim women still believe husbands deserve to beat ‘disobedient’ wives: Survey  [https://www.todayonline.com/world/one-five-malaysian-muslim-women-still-believe-husbands-deserve-beat-disobedient-wives-survey](https://www.todayonline.com/world/one-five-malaysian-muslim-women-still-believe-husbands-deserve-beat-disobedient-wives-survey) 

Close to a quarter of Muslim women in Malaysia surveyed still believe that a husband can strike his wife, citing the religious concept of “nusyuz” or refusing to obey a husband’s wishes or commands.

According to the survey by rights group Sisters in Islam (SIS) on Muslim women’s realities in Malaysia, this “disobedience” can include leaving the house without a husband’s consent to simply refusing sex.

“Worryingly, 21 per cent of respondents believe that a husband has a right to beat his wife. Among those who accept this, the concept of nusyuz appears to provide a justification,” said the report titled Perception and Realities: The Public and Personal Rights of Muslim Women in Malaysia published on Tuesday (Oct 15).

The survey also found that almost all respondents, at 97 per cent, said that Muslim women must obey their husbands, and that obedience defines a woman as a “good wife”.

Among the respondents, 88 per cent agreed that leaving the house without the husband’s consent counts as “nusyuz”. 

In comparison, the percentages of those who felt these actions count as “nusyuz” include: Refusing to move with the husband (54 per cent), refusing to have sexual intercourse (52 per cent), refusing to open the door for the husband (50 per cent), or refusing to answer when the husband calls (46 per cent).

“Under these circumstances, they believe a husband may beat his wife. They believe that these are acts of disobedience by the wife, and therefore the husband is permitted to strike her. 

“This goes directly against the principles of the Quran and is in complete contradiction to the practice of Prophet Muhammad who never hit his wife under any circumstances,” the report explained.

However, proponents of punishment against women usually cite religious scriptures to back the act of beating “disobedient wives”.

These include verse 4:34 of the Quran which said: “But those (wives) from whom you fear arrogance — (first) advise them; (then if they persist), forsake them in bed; and (finally), strike them.” 

SIS said this “uncompromising duty to obey one’s husband” has led to harm and injustices against women, such as the reluctance to report domestic violence including marital rape, being stopped from going work, forgoing opportunities to study, and being unable to plan their family.

The report also showed that while 89 per cent of respondents felt that they are equal to their spouse, merely 57 per cent felt they can leave the marriage at any time. 

Section 59 of the Islamic Family Law (Federal Territory) Act 1984 states that a wife shall be entitled to maintenance when she is “nusyuz”, and can only revert when she “repents and obeys” the husband.

“This concept plays a central role in institutionalising, justifying and sustaining a patriarchal model of families in the Muslim context, and must be challenged. 

“Far from creating harmony in marriage, these laws are among the main causes of marital breakdown and violence against women. There is thus an urgent need for reform,” SIS said in its report.

The survey was conducted by research firm Ipsos between 2018 and 2019 through two phases, with the quantitative phase involving 675 Muslim women across the country aged between 18 and 55. MALAY MAIL

"How do I come out of the closet as an atheist without my friends either hating me or constantly trying to “save me” Some background: grew up Catholic and in college a friend of mine convinced me to work at an evangelical Christian summer camp. I was in a rough spot in my life and bought into their message. Currently, I’m a college student and I volunteer at a local youth ministry organization. I broke up with my girlfriend because of our differences in faith and have distanced myself from a lot of my friends because it can be so frustrating to hear the way they talk about other people and the world. I also stopped going to church. I would hate to abandon the kids I volunteer with but I also almost hate volunteering at the youth group because the organization pushes such a literalist agenda and their beliefs are frankly ridiculous. Specifically, the way I hear them talk about people of different faith, gay people, and non-believers angers me. For people who are supposed to preach love and humility they sure are some of the most judgemental and prideful people I know.

"How do you deal with the fact that you’ll never see your family again? (15f) I very recently decided that I’m agnostic atheist. I was raised Christian and my whole life up until a few months ago I was always okay with death if I meant I went to heaven because I got to see my family. Well now I obviously won’t be going to heaven and I’ve accepted the fact that I’m just matter and will die like any other plant/animal. I still get sad knowing that I’ll probably never see my family members again in afterlife. If you were raised Christian/ religious how did you get over that?

I also believe that no one will see there family (because even if heaven is real a lot of people believe they just spend their time worshiping god) still it’s hard because that’s not what I was raised to think. Anyway I’m so confused rn and I’m just trying to figure it all out.",atheism,t3_dku95h

"Personal Story/Rant I am 18 years old and have been an agnostic atheist since I was probably about 14. Even though I left my faith, I still think it's extremely important to respect people's faith and their opinions. For the most part, I do. When someone tells me that they're Christian or Muslim, I don't start arguments, I don't storm off or anything, and I'm not trying to praise myself for that because I feel that is what any respectful adult should do. But today was my sister's confirmation banquet/prep night. I was uncomfortable at church but I was there for her, and her only. But then the kids had to read their faith statements. 

It was honestly hard to listen to. One girl talked about how her grandparents died, and she didn't understand why God would do that, and how cruel it was. But then she goes on to say, ""But it's okay because God makes everything happen for a reason"". I am disgusted and angered that these children, not much younger than me, are being almost brainwashed to just think that every awful thing in their life is ""meant to happen because God has a plan"".

I know many people have it worse, and I'm grateful to have a family that didn't cast me out because my religious beliefs differ from them, but I am just so sad that these kids may be temporarily or even permanently robbed of the ability to see and process things from a secular view, instead of being told time and time again, that ""everything will be fine because Jesus"".",atheism,t3_dksjqr

I know most people say it won’t matter because I won’t be aware of being dead, but that’s the part that scares me-being nothing, not existing.

"The “God Has a Plan” Fallacy I’m so tired of the “God has a plan” rhetoric that people use to justify all the shitty things that happen to them. The fact that anyone would believe that ‘God’ is here to micromanage every thought/decision/action that ALL creatures on earth do is just bananas to me. 

I don’t believe in god, but if I did I would certainly see it as more plausible that “he” made the universe, made life, gave them free will, and was done with it. Then “he” just let the cards fall as they may.

The fact that so many people will just attribute bad things to god is crazy. I lost my job, a loved one died, a child gets cancer, etc. That was a grand plan god had. You were just a bad employee, your loved had a heart attack from poor diet and no exercise, and that child just had a gene mutation go wrong.

But if you think that ‘your god’ is a being that is cool with giving kids cancer and genocide, then it certainly doesn’t seem like something you should be worshiping.

The same holds true for the ridiculous “I’ll pray for you” and of course “thoughts and prayers”. As if god is sitting around deciding on whether or not young Billy is going to make it through surgery based on the prayers he gets... Like a facebook for god where is saving whomever smashes that like button the most.

"Past Extraterrestrial visitation might be the source of many religious traditions today. I know this topic makes people highly skeptical about Aliens and Ufos but I see it as a real possibility. 

I find it quite unusual that some native tribes from across the planet describe similar views on God or his powers. Even beyond the time of the oldest Abrahamic religions you will find some weird cave paintings that describe none human beings and even flying ships all across the world. 

It is hard to come up with evidence on such topic cause there is no direct source to analyze except stories, myths, and legends and drawings. However, if I had to argue with a religious person I would say it is more likely that if anything “Super natural” occurred in the past if it wasnt nature than it must have been some technology that people at the time couldnt even explain rather than an act of “God” to convince a bunch of isolated tribes he is the creator of the universe.

Imagine if you showed an iPhone to Jesus or Mohamed or if they saw a Drone flying they would have thought it is a divine revelation anyhow and write entire books of this sighting. 

People do the same today when they think they saw Bigfoot, Ghosts, or Aliens.

"Atheism and Capital Punishment As an atheist, I try to find the right moral position on a subject. Capital punishment is a bit problematic:

On the one hand, killing someone for a misdeed (murder, treason etc...) assumes that society in general has some sort of ""right"" to execute someone for that deed. It also assumes that the justice system is never makes a mistake when it hands down that kind of sentence.

"Here's the problem with atheist vs religious debates: the religious have assumed the conclusion even before the debate. Here's an example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n-zYRZy5NQ&amp;t=](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n-zYRZy5NQ&amp;t=) (look at the description)

The description on the Bill Nye vs Ken Ham debate is another example. The religious parties claims that they want to ""spark real discussion"", but that's simply not true. Look at the descriptions, comments, etc. They're super preachy, and it looks like they don't even listen to arguments from the other side. 

Atheists aren't perfect, either. It seems like atheists in the comment sections, on social media, etc, have, are also... should I say ""preachy""? ""insulting""? 

I'm beginning to wonder what the point of these debates are. If neither side are listening to the other, why even spend the energy and money to put on these debates?

Don't get me wrong. I can't speak for all atheists and all religious people. But I feel like all to often the religious, with how they put the debates online, are assuming the conclusion and not listening to the other side.

Here's another example: Dan Barker once did a debate with a muslim. The topic was going to be "" Does God exist""?

"Any Former Christians Have This Experience? Sorry for the length of this:

I was raised in liberal, mainline Protestant church, and went to Sunday School and Church every Sunday.  I didn't have serious problems with the doctrine until I was a teenager and I learned about the Unpardonable Sin--blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.  I remember various people's interpretations, which are still seared in my mind 20 years later:

1.  ""Don't tell jokes about the Holy Spirit,""
2. ""Don't say that God is in league with Satan,""
3. A crappy Christian propaganda video for kids where a kid ""Christian soldier"" who experiences an event that makes him angry is told to ""watch what he said next"" or he could face a ""court martial"",
4. God is going to judge you for every stray thought in your head,
5. ""Don't take the Lord's name in vain, God is serious about that.""

I had such anxiety trying to wrap my head around a sin that would irrevocably damn me to hell.  Why couldn't God be clear about what he meant? Why did people have all these different interpretations.

I started getting freaked out by any jokes involving God.  ""Would this count?  Am I going to hell for laughing at this or for retelling this joke?""  I would play conversations with my friends over and over in my head and try to figure out arguments to reassure myself.  I would have to use thought stopping techniques, as I thought that thinking ""The Holy Spirit sucks"" (this was hard to type) or something like that, would damn me to hell.  I had trouble sleeping; I had to put the TV on in my room so that I wouldn't be consumed by my thoughts.

I became afraid of church and any discussion of Christianity.  When I still had to go to church I would anxiously look in the bulletin to make sure there was nothing about the Unpardonable Sin in there.  I was anxious about pretty much any sermon, as the topic might come up.  I knew I could not face finding out that, yes, I was irrevocably going to Hell.  I couldn't (and I still can't) imagine the level of psychological DAMAGE being convinced of that would bring.  I decided I just didn't want to know so I could at least live a halfway decent life.  So I would avoid any discussion of religion, including finding ways to leave the room where my family was discussing it.

Thankfully in college I stopped going to church regularly, so it stopped bothering me as much.  Then, in my early 30s I became an atheist (for unrelated reasons).  But once I realized the falsity of Christianity, I began to have this anger, especially towards preachers and pastors, because of how I felt as a teenager.

Like really understanding that we don't do things based on some devine being, I literally just try to be the best version of myself that I can be.

"DM proselytizing - Has anyone else had this experience? I recently received a message from a user claiming to want to know more about my beliefs.

&gt;I came across your username in the atheist sub.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’m interested in learning more about the atheist perspective, and was wondering if you’d like to have a discussion.  
&gt;  
&gt;I’d like to ask a few questions and pick your brain for a bit.  
&gt;  
&gt;Are you interested?

We switched to DMs and had a brief bit of relatively normal conversation. The person claimed to be a scientist who believed in god. However, they quickly switched into a prepared series of messages that were copy-pasted. The following is how they began:

&gt;Let’s examine it more specifically. I walk through it with 5 points, so that you can respond along the way

1. The sequence of the genetic code; whether in the nucleic acids or protein; is highly specific. Let’s just consider proteins.   Before proteins existed, amino acids had to form, and then they had to form peptide bonds between each other. Amino acids would bind essentially one at a time, building a polypeptide molecule.   Just considering sequence alone, for every sequence (250 amino acids) that is functional, there are \*\*10\^77 non-functional sequences\*\*. \[(PubMed/Elsevier)\]([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15321723/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15321723/))  When we take into consideration the type of bond formed between amino acids, and the probability of the L-isomer\* of the amino acid being used, the probability of forming a functional 250 amino acid long protein becomes \*\*1 chance in 10\^164 chances\*\*. \[(Supplemental source)\]([https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/is-doug-axe-right-about-the-rarity-of-proteins/4711](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/is-doug-axe-right-about-the-rarity-of-proteins/4711))  \*\*Think of it like your hands. They are mirror images of each other. Identical, yet non-superimposable. Only the left handed version of amino acids are biologically viable\*\*

At this point I told the user I don't know enough about biology to make informed conclusions from their argument, and called them out for not engaging in good-faith dialog. I accused them of clear proselytizing and they immediately stopped responding.

I wanted to discuss with y'all if anyone else had had similar experiences in the past with users trying to proselytize via Reddit. This is clearly an attempt by a religious organization to up their game and use the internet as a tool to disseminate seemingly logical arguments that rely on their targets' lack of knowledge of specific fields of science. At the first sign that the user isn't dumb enough to fall for their bullshit, they abandon the endeavor.

Does anyone else have any experience with this kind of thing?

I dm’d said mod and he said “you’d not allowed to encourage a child to disobey god” and then we got into this whole thing about how parents pass down religion so kids never actually get to choose, in which he responded “if we didn’t teach children the way of god, they I guess we don’t need to teach them not to drink dish soap”.

I come from a religious family and we went to church today. I'm fairly familiar with the whole hell aspect 

But today, when I was sitting in the toilet after watching an episode of the atheist experience. I thought to myself. Fire, lake of fire. And I thought about it for five days. I personally could never survive that. I'd hate it. But the Bible says people like me will spend the rest of time in it. Its kinda a scary concept

So, conflicted, I thought to myself. I'm gonna say a prayer. My last prayer. God's last chance to reveal himself to me. It went a little like this

""God, if you are there, I really want you to know that I grow tired of your games, I want to know you. This is your last chance to reveal yourself. I'm willing to change my life in an instant if you just prove yourself this once. My eternity is in your hands""

"How Religion Almost Killed Me Before I start, I am ok. This is an after-reflection of my mental health problems. This is only meant to reflect on a broken system and tell my story. Thank you for letting me get this off my chest. 

I grew up extremely religious. I was a very devout catholic and I loved it. I loved learning about religion (I still do, but purely academically), I loved the people it brought me to, I loved the comfort of knowing there was a being who loved me and cared for me. I was often praised and admired for involvement and dedication. About sophomore year of high school, I exhausted the material they could give me, so I started digging more on my own. That's when you get to the more difficult stuff. And when I would bring this up, I did not find answers, but was instead brushed off. The more I insisted, the less receptive these people I admired and loved were. I didnt want to leave the church. But as I grew more and more desperate, the responses became more and more cold, until I was pushed out of the social circles I had loved so much. 

I would occasionally meet with the youth minister, whom I had felt I had grown pretty close to and could trust. My mental health had been steadily declining, as I had pretty bad untreated depression. Naturally, this would come up when discussing the nature of God, and one thing he told me I have never been able to properly get out of my head. ""Maybe you have depression because God is punishing you on earth instead of after you die."" Many things of the same sentiment were being drilled into my head, day in and day out. I lost so much when I left the church that I never even thought about. It hurts to lose a support system. It hurts so much more to realize that theres no God who loves you. It still does. 

Fast forward about 6 years. I switched some medications while I was very stressed and they started to cause side effects, one of which was religious delusions. Suddenly, all of the things that were said to me back in high school came back with a vengeance. Maybe I was in such a bad place because God is there after all and He's angry with me and he is punishing me. But I dont want to have to deal with God punishing me at inconvenient times. So, what if I just punish myself and get it done with? This led me down an extremely self-destructive path where I dealt with having no self-esteem, worrying that all of my friends would leave me again if I wasnt perfect, feeling like I didnt deserve to be alive, and enacting my own punishment on myself by self-harming. I had the sudden realization one night that these thoughts were what was ruining me. I couldnt let religion control me anymore. I needed to break free.

"So.... ProphetofCompassion is trending on Twitter in my country. I'm gonna try to be succinct here. I'm from India, and #ProphetofCompassion is trending on Twitter. 

A few days ago, a right-wing Hindu religious leader and politician (Kamlesh Tiwari) was murdered. He called the prophet the first homosexual in the world a couple of years ago. It's been reported that he's received death threats since then. And a few days ago he was killed. The investigation is ongoing, but naturally, people have come to their assumptions.  

This sparked a debate online about Islam and stuff, with right-wingers saying it's obvious who did the killing, and leftist liberals saying the investigation has revealed nothing yet. I open up Twitter ten minutes ago, and this shit's trending. A majority of them saying that the prophet in question is the epitome of morality.

It's disturbing how many people refuse to acknowledge the deficiencies of their religion and the problematic elements of it. And if you raise even a legitimate concern, you're called an islamophobe. I just wanted to say, no one who marries a six year old is an epitome of morality. Not to mention so much of the other crap they conveniently forget when quoting their prophet. But I use my real name on twitter, and I didn't want to get involved in the nonsense (and often, subsequent online harassment, which has happened before).

"Christian Polytheism Someone may have already talked about this, but I feel like sharing this opinion.

Many people point towards the Christian concept of the trinity as evidence that the religion is polytheistic.  However, Christians assert that father, son, and holy spirit are all one.  One could argue that they share this in common with the Hindu concept of brahma, where the gods originate from one cosmic force.

Ignoring the trinity, I still think of the religion as polytheistic.  Ignoring the communion of saints tradition that exists in Catholicism and the various Orthodoxies, the belief of angels and demons seem to undermine the idea that Christianity is monotheistic.  Although Christian's do not worship demons or angels, they do believe in their existences.  Heck, some angels have specialized roles, like Gabriel (messenger angel) and Michael (war angel).  Angels and demons, in the Christian mythos are ""supernatural"" beings.  The only difference between henotheism and Christian monotheism, is that angels and demons are not called ""gods"" and not worshipped.  Thus, I say that Christianity is polytheistic.  Hell, one could take this further and claim that Islam is polytheistic as well.

Someone who is more versed in Christian theology may be able to refute this.  I am curious if any other people on this subreddit share my opinion on this matter.",atheism,t3_dkc6at

His arguments include but are not limited to:
•bible is a historically accurate book, therefore it is reasonable to assume that the god is real too
•if something exist, there has to be someone/something that created it. Because universe exists, god exists
•there's no other explanation for some things (universe, miracles, etc)
•only an all-loving god could create a world like this
•since atheists haven't been able to prove god doesn't exist, it is very likely he exists
 
Not only does he commit many logical fallacies, he also ignores my points completely (why would a loving god create so much evil, lack of proof, etc).

"How do you guys deal with overreligious parents? Hey guys, long time lurker here.


I'm a 25M Nigerian heretic to Nigerian immigrant parents that have spent the last 8 years in swimming in the Southern Baptist flavor of Kool-Aid. I'm financially independent and living on my own. I'm in a bit of a predicament.

Recently, I just got of the phone with my parents because  they hadn't heard from me in a while. The conversation started off merry, then it digressed to gun violence in the US and how easy it is to die even if you mildly inconvenience the wrong person.

My mother then follows with ""That's why God is important."" 

Knowing fully well the unfettered clownfiesta that's about to ensue, I try to change the topic, however she pulls out the fact that I'm an atheist and asks ""What do you have to lose?"" (Classic Pascal's Wager) 

I tell her that question is fallacious and why it is so and she refuses to understand that she HAS to prove god. She insists that her belief is sufficient as proof.

Then, while I'm questioning why I haven't hung up the phone, we talk about existence and where shit comes from and why the Big Bang isn't credible. For everything, thing I tell her like how evolution by natural selection is how organism come to be to how the carbon she's comprised of is the same of that in stars, she asks ""Well who caused that?"" like there's some motherfucker overseeing smooth and seamless operation of the universe. The call ended on a sour note with my mother saying that ""You're a smart kid, but I'm sorry that you won't believe.""

Now my problem. I love my parents, but inside, I'm fucking sick of talking to them. Hell, I'm sick of seeing them and associating with them. The SBC has changed them and their lifestyle so much, that it's hard as fuck to gave a human conversation with them. They are pretty much bible bots with a plethora of topics. Part of the reason I hate this time of year is because they bitch and moan about me coming home and seeing me. I'd very much save the $500 and my time. They know I'm an atheist.

I'm tired they they brag that they're college educated but don't have the wherewithal to question if what they know is fallacious or just plain wrong.

"Why Mormons are fucking crazy! It's important to note that I'm 30 now, so this happened when I was still in high school. So I met this guy when I was 16, and we started dating, fast forward 2 years and we are both out of high school and engaged (looking back on it, an 18 year old has no business being engaged). Anyway, my then fiance had been raised Mormon, and wanted me to convert to the religion as that was what as expected by me and everyone in his big Mormon family. So I went through all the lessons, and got baptized in the church (that part is important). His family was Air Force and so they moved around a lot, so shortly after he proposed his family moved to Colorado so the relationship became long distance. That summer when he came to visit, things got hot and heavy and we ended up losing our virginity to each other; I had been raised to save myself for marriage and figured since I was engaged to this guy, who at the time was the love of my life, it was basically the same thing (big mistake).

So a few days later, he gets typical Mormon guilt and decides to tell both his parents and his bishop at church...next thing I know, my mom gets a call from fiance's mother telling her that I am no longer welcome at their home. When my mom asked why, she was told that ""Jezebels and harlots aren't welcome in their 'House of the Lord,' because 'my son would have NEVER been tempted or agreed to any of this if YOUR DAUGHTER wasn't such a temptress!'..."" At this point my mom GOES OFF on her, telling her that she hates to break it to her, but it takes two to tango and she might wanna have a conversation with her son as he was more than capable of making that decision on his own as we are both 18.

His mother then hangs up in my mom's face and for the next 2 weeks, proceeds to make a point to call our house at least twice a day leaving messages on our answering machine about how much of a slut I am, how God hates me and I should be ashamed of myself. At this point, I honestly had no experience in handling any of this and would be reduced to tears on the daily. From a religious perspective, I understand the value of chastity before marriage, but when you resort to acts of harassment and slander is beyond my comprehension even to this day. You might be asking what consequences befell my fiance during all of this....NOTHING. Absolutely nothing. He told his parents and they forgave him and told him that he was a victim and not responsible. His bishop (the Mormon equivalent of a pastor) told him to ask God for forgiveness and read his scriptures daily.

To makes matters worse, his mother decides to make a phone call to the bishop at MY church and tell him everything that happened. Next thing I know, I'm getting pulled into his office and told that my ""sin"" was 2nd only to murder and that God and his grace have abandoned me. I WAS BESIDE MYSELF IN TEARS! Furthermore, I was told that I was no longer allowed to teach Sunday School, and I wasn't permitted to sit with anyone during the sermon. That's right, I was made to sit BY MYSELF and separate from EVERYONE just to drive the point home that I wasn't ""worthy"" to sit with everyone else.

The whole experience was absolutely horrific and caused me a lot of trauma that I had to work through as a result. His mother still maintains to this day that I am the worst person on the face of the planet and that her son is a saint. Needless to say, we broke off our engagement and went our separate ways.  —————————

UPDATE ON AFTERMATH: After I stopped going to sacrament or the ward in general, the Mormon missionaries would routinely sit outside my house waiting for either me or my mom to get home. When I moved to a new city, they continued to sit outside my mom's house to ask me where I was. SOMEHOW they found out where I had moved, transferred my records to that ward and the harassment continued! It took 5 years and a cease and desist letter from a lawyer to get them to leave me alone and remove my name from church records! It took me that long to get a lawyer involved because I was trying to save myself the hassle.


I'm not religious at all anymore. You don't have to have religion to be a good person, and truth be told, those that claim religion tend to be the worst garbage people I've ever met. They hide behind theology as a justification for treating people like shit. So yeah, after going to massive amounts of therapy to reprogram my brain out of thinking I was nothing but trash, I left all organized religion and never looked back. Since then, now at 30, I have spent every day since then rebuilding everything that he broke. And I refuse to ever be treated like that by anyone ever again.",atheism,t3_djnsdj

"A (Personal) Argument for Why Morality isn't Objective and Why it Doesn't Matter WARNING: GIANT WALL OF TEXT BELOW
Okay so...
Often times I hear theists make the claim that morality is objective because, 'it just seems so much like it is', and unless we can find any solid reasoning against that gut feeling, we're stuck with that as our default position. Well, for me, as someone who was once a devout Muslim, apostasy seemed to be a clear evil--not on the same order of magnitude as something like rape or murder, but evil nonetheless. I think this is significant because I used to identify the two--rape/murder and apostasy--with a feeling of the same kind. Obviously now I don't have the same views on apostasy as I did before... But I'm not sure how anyone can make the case that any of it is truly objective; I still identify that same feeling of the same kind--""evil"" or ""bad""--with respect to rape and murder, because regardless of the magnitude, fundamentally, that same feeling I attached to apostasy now appears as a once childish opinion. So, what's the basis for this 'morality is true because we're by default convinced of it' argument? I can never imagine a similar scenerio where I once could be convinced that a triangle has 3 sides, but after some consideration, change my mind.

One more thing to consider is based in definitions and asking why any of it matters. ""Objectively true"" = independently measurable. My point is... So what? We as a society have to fundamentally care whether it's worthwhile to chase down and root out evil wherever we find it regardless of whether this thing we call evil is independently measurable or itself is a subjective notion. I wanna call Hitler bad because to me, he's not a nice guy and I don't like that lol. I don't really care whether him being bad is independently measurable,  you know?

"Been a while but life's going pretty great. So I posted here a while ago about my situation, senior in high school that just converted, was in an active relationship with a religious fruitcake, and woried that my life would crumble apart, you know the usual stuff. 

Please don't worry about me and my ex, the relationship was terrible but has not effected my life negatively in anyway other than losing him as a person I could talk to.

Things have gotten a lot better, I couldn't be happier that my relationship has ended and looking back from the outside in I really should have run out of there faster. He has all the neccessary qualities of an abuser, mainly mentally and emotionally but potentially physically as well. Examples are he insulted my family pretty much every chance he got (my parents are divorced but currently live together) by calling it inappropriate and telling me they aren't really looking out for me since they don't go to church. Same with my siblings. But I usually ignored it because I don't like confrontation and he would always come up with some sort of reason for his thoughts. He called me selfish and untrustworthy if I didn't give in to his commands the first time, and he told all of his friends literally everything we did even after I told him that made me very uncomfortable because a relationship is meant to be between two people not eight.

Regardless that is all in the past and he now actively avoids me because I refuse to taken advantage of like that again. Which has lead to me being a lot more comfortable in other aspects of my life, I've never been socially awkward with strangers because honestly I'll likely never run into them again and I'm not special enough to make that big of an impression. But with the people I interact with daily I've become more confident one of my ex-friends is still super clingy to me I use to just ignore it and avoid them but I've started to tell them to please back off whenever I'm uncomfortable and they actually do. 

My pastor has not confronted me again about my lack of belief and I honestly doubt he will unless someone else tells him to. (heres hoping at least) And my best friend who now knows I don't believe could not care less and its incredible, he told me he expected it and has a loose belief himself but has experienced to many coincidences to confidently not believe. It makes me so relieved that I won't actually lose him when we graduate and it has made us better friends. 

I also had a great conversation with a girl that knows I don't believe about my view of supernatural things and the afterlife which went great. And apparently helped her quite a bit as shes very paranoid and my break down of unexplainable things helped her have a bit more of a disconnect with it.

Even my family life has improved quite a bit. My semi religious sister just finds my approach to life amusing and has congratulation me for finding my own beliefs. My brother just laughs at the religious fruitcakes with me and me and my dad have been able to find common ground on more political things that I didn't feel confortable discussing before. My mother is as supportive and curios as ever but does worried that one day I'll slip up and cause a lot of problems for myself, and honestly shes probably right. 

Sorry for the absolute mess this update is.

Tldr: life is going great me and my best friend are closer then we were before, my ex avoids me rather trying to preach to me more. My pastor ignores me rather than calling me out, and I comforted an agnostic that goes to my school with my lack of afterlife outlook. And my family life is easier and more comfortable now that I'm more confident about myself.

"Hi, introductory post So I’m basically someone who’s very new to doubting my own religion, which is a bit scary for my in and of itself. I’ve just had doubts all my life but had to brush them under the rug because it was the only thing that gave me comfort. I blamed my doubts on my age- how could a mere 18 year old be smarter in religion than an adult who’s clearly satisfied with religion?- or that I was just in terrible risk of going to hell If I ever strayed from religion. Which scares me still, but I want to do this anyway.

I’ve lived life with people answering questions with “god knows best”, and that just left a pit in my stomach in the absence of an actual answer. I thought to myself “is religion incompatible with science”? And I told myself ‘no”, since my family is heavily involved with modern science fields such as medicine. I asked myself “does religion demean women?” And told myself “no” since the women in my household are powerhouses of education and work. 

Somewhere in the back of my mind, I didn’t want to acknowledge that maybe.. just maybe.. I lived like this due to modern life influence instead of religion. Sure, in my religion women get to work, as my mother does, but... they’re only allowed to work with a husband’s permission. They can only have friends with man’s permission.  It’s ok to beat wives as long as it’s “gently”. Killing black dogs is ok. And other science stuff just sometimes doesn’t add up.

Now, if a religion was truly perfect, everything would check out with reality. No science should be false. One wrong fact should be enough to make me quit, right? What omniscient diety could make a mistake?

I wish. When I dare to question, I often get “this is a misinterpretation”. And to get the real interpretation, I have to learn a whole language that I don’t have time for, so I have to rely on what others say is true- which is still conflicting. And then there’s the matter of “what if what the science we don’t agree with is actually just science we haven’t yet discovered?” since human knowledge is always advancing more and more each day. “What if our current laws of physics aren’t fully developed/true yet”? 

I’m not truly a theist, not truly an atheist, I’m just stuck in the middle. I’ve always been terribly afraid of atheists too, but I had to ask myself if it was because they were evil people with no morals, or if it was because their ideas made me doubt what I believed was a solid reality. Without a solid reality, I have nothing to cling onto, and no purpose in life.

Then I told myself that’s not an argument.

I have honestly a boatload of issues with all this religious vs atheism stuff but I just wanted to vent. For the first time ever, I’m stepping out of my comfort zone. Hope this goes well. I feel like a betrayer of my family and religion already, but here goes nothing :/",atheism,t3_djuwwp

My response to that is, so who created God? Because clearly you believe everything has a catalyst to it, right? So then why don't you apply that same logic to God: Where did God come from? Did *he* just pop out of nowhere? If so, you are being hypocritical when you say the Big Bang Theory is illogical.

I will admit that there are still some questions that may never be answered. You can go on and on about catalysts of the Big Bang. Ok, so X caused Big Bang to happen. But then where did X come from? Ok, X came from A and B. But where did A and B come from? And so on.

I had to read ""Rebellion"" and ""The Grand Inquisitor"" for one of my classes.

Reading it, something just clicked in my brain. I actually teared up a little. This was probably one of the most profound works I've read in my life. All the issues that I had with Christianity was just written out there for me. The near-righteous fury that Ivan displayed towards the end gave me fucking chills. I don't know why, but a weight lifted itself off of me.

I'm now considering writing my thesis on it now.

With that all being said, I wanted to ask you guys/gals about your thoughts on it. Anything really, I just wanted to see if there was anything I might have missed in my reading. The discussion I had with my class (small classroom discussion style) was, frankly, really disappointing. I ended up talking to my professor about it for a while after class.

Sorry about all the gushing and dramatics. I just really enjoyed reading this shit. Also, if this wasn't the best thread for me to post this sorry about that. I didn't know where else I could really post it.",atheism,t3_djuycl
"Reincarnation Is Actually Really Logical!! For the past few nights I've been awake thinking in bed about the purpose of life, and the existence of an afterlife. Due to this excessive pondering I've concluded a few things.

1: Heaven and Hell don't exist, but can be experienced due to pre-death hallucinations, only if you believe these things exist. If you believe you lived an indecent life, you will experience hell, if not you will experience heaven, in the way you expect it to be.

2: Besides an eternal slumber, reincarnation is the most probable outcome. The reincarnation won't be based on ""good"" or ""bad"" actions either.

The reasoning for #2 is this, before I was born, what was I doing? Scientist estimate the universe has been in existence for over 13 BILLION YEARS, and I have only existed for a tiny portion of that time. The rest of that time I didn't exist, I wasn't a cell, I wasn't life, I wasn't even a thought. But for whatever reason, I was born and now I exist. This means I went from not existing to existing. And after living a full life I will eventually die, meaning I will return back to non-existence. Because we have proof that beings can go from non-existence to existence, why can't I do it again? I incarnated once, why can't I reincarnate?

I don't know the mechanism for the reincarnation, because I don't believe in spirits or souls. But using only physical principals I can deduce that memories, talents, looks, personalities and all other traits are lost between each incarnation, because all those things are physically stored in the body and will disappear once your body decomposes. This leaves me with another question, what actually is incarnated then? What am I really? IDK

Another problem with reincarnation is that I have no idea how long it takes between each incarnation. If the universe is 13 billion years old, and I only have proof that I incarnated once, it is entirely possible that it takes 13 billion years to incarnate into another body! Or maybe it's instantaneous? Or maybe its random. IDK

Even with all these questions, this mental exercise gave me a new purpose in life. Given that reincarnation is real, I don't want to start completely over with each incarnation. My goal is to become so successful and notable in this life, that when I die, my next incarnation will end up learning about his past self, functionally passing on a majority of my knowledge  from one life to another!!",atheism,t3_dkccs4

"What can we do to get God out of the U.S. Government? Seriously So the new Ohio license has a banner that reads ""With God, all things are possible"" which happens to also be the state motto (1959). Whether you like it or not, I think we should all agree that this should be a personal option as it's a personal opinion.

It's bad enough that on every other street corner is a church, kingdom hall, mosque, temple, etc telling you how to live on a sign; all the while millions of dollars are wasted on these extravagant buildings where that money would otherwise be put to better use. Then you have handouts (litter) scattered at your door inviting you to such and such congregation and don't forget about people knocking on the door.

Generally the moral thing to do is just ignore it if it's not your bag, and that's pretty much what I do and I'm sure most others who don't participate do too. But every now and then it's hard to ignore; because it is literally EVERYWHERE.

If a religion is what you choose to practice to get through life then hey what ever floats your boat. Honestly, who am I too judge? Life ain't easy and we all have our ways of leading it the best we can - as individuals. The same cannot be said for most religions.

"My dad said something unexpected. So my dad was talking to me about his principals (or something, my memory is very bad) and said they were God, at the top, work, then family because it will always be there. He said something similar to ""I need to work so my family can still be supported."" The God part I was a little worried about. Dad already knows I'm non-religious and that's not changing but I'm a bit concerned for the future that he's going to have another goddamn talk with me about how there may be truth I could find by myself in religious scripture (Bible) and argue that we can't totally be certain there's a god or not.

Another one of those discussions with him will piss me off. I don't like talking about it with him especially now be he said that I could never change his mind about the existence of a god. The part that's upsetting is that he's willing to not change his view on somethings, and this is one of those topics. I hate some people being stubborn like that. I would change my mind if I was proven wrong about something. There's so many more gray areas than black and white areas, right?

I've vowed to never talk to him again on discussions on religion. Him saying he would never change his mind skocked the crap out of me. The rest of my family is definitely religious I won't reveal anything to them, although I wish I had known about this subreddit much sooner so I wouldn't have told anyone.

Also my dad has said other provoking things like not wanting Aron Ra to be his teacher (I was showing his Classification of life playlist) because of the way he looks and maybe because he's an atheist. But by the way, where can I find Aron's credentials?

After the lesson, two of my good friends were talking to me as we were making our way to the next lesson. My friends were Muslim but they never asked me why I was an atheist and shared a lot of my views. They had never lied to me. They both thought that the quote was not really said by Muhammad and they gave two reasons for it.

1. Muhammad was a feminist (I assume they meant that he believed in equal rights)

"Biblical Scholarship So we all love the four horsemen of (new) atheism. (Harris, Hitchens, Dawkins, &amp; Dennett) Well, most of us do. Atheism is our gig. It's why we're here on this sub. 

And as much as I love the arguments, philosophy, and the whole plethora of rationale we use against theists. It can, at times grate on me. The same old, tired arguments thrown into the mix constantly. It gets very tiresome, I swear if I hear the term 'magical sky daddy/wizard' again I'm going to lose my mind. The problem is, is not that I disagree with that talk, I don't I'm an atheist obviously. But after the hundredth time of hearing it, these arguments just become puerile to me.

So I looked elsewhere, a new brand of conversation to dip into. Biblical &amp; Islamic scholarship. 

Historical evidence and the origins of the scriptures. I've picked up three authors that are fascinating reads. Thomas Romer, Richard Carrier, and Tom Holland. All three are outspoken rationalists having done at least a handful of presentations &amp; interviews, aswell as books.

Romer's book 'The Invention Of God' deals with the cultural development of the god of Israel, and the origins and evolution of Judaism. 

Carrier deals with the new testament and the historicity of jesus in his book. Using copious amounts of study to prove whether or not there is any basis at all for this jesus fellow. And the cultural development of Christianity as a whole, marking it alongside the other personal Savior religions of the time.

Holland, follows the start, arise, and hysteria of the arab cult that swept across the Persian Empire replacing zoroastrianism. 

While I havent read Holland's book yet, (in the shadow of the Sword) these authors among many others I've failed to mention are in their own clique if you like of deconstructing the Abrahamic religions down at the pillars and very foundations. 

It's all really interesting stuff, and I think showing them that their god, YHWH, is nothing more than a anthropomorphised mountain is a far better rebuttal to a theist than comparing their silly beliefs to the tooth fairy. 

I'm sorry for the long boring post if it wasn't your cup of tea. But as apologies I'll drop some vids of each of these dude's presentations so you can see for yourself. And you can see if I'm onto something or if I should just stfu.

"She's substituting a funeral with Sunday church services Hello Reddit friends. I'm not entirely sure this post is appropriate here, but I hope so because I'm not sure where else to go with it.

My partner's father passed away yesterday. He had cancer and was in hospice, so it was pretty expected. He and his wife moved to the other side of the state several years ago, ~3 hour drive. We don't get along with the wife, nor do his 2 sisters. There had been a lot of different options discussed about what the father wanted to happen after he passed, but nothing was ever officially decided to my knowledge. All I know for sure is that he wanted to be cremated.

Today we received information on the ""funeral arrangements."" Saturday (tomorrow) is visitation at their home on the other side of the state. Sunday says ""7 - 8 visitation, 10 am church."" Next Sunday is ""11 am church, followed by meeting at cemetery"" on this side of the state.

I looked up the church, and just as I'd expected, they hold Sunday worship at 10 am. I'm pretty sure there's no actual funeral scheduled for my partner's father, nor any kind of memorial for him. We are expected to go to a regular ol Sunday service because...??? Neither of them were ever regular church goers and if they are even members of this church it's news to me. 

This is where I'm lost. I'm not going to Sunday church services. I would of course attend an actual funeral held in a church, but I'm not listening to someone preach about God for an hour in honor of a man that could not have cared less about religion. 

Obviously I will be wherever my partner needs me, but I just cannot wrap my head around this entire situation. The timeline of ""services"" doesn't match up to the actual timeline of cremation services (in my experience) and I surely hope she's not planning to have his dead body driven over here more than a week after his passing!

"Need some help refuting the idea that 'individuals have intrinsic value' is an inherently christian idea I've been talking with a pretty reasonable guy who happens to be a pastor at the park where our kids play. I told him that I think morality can be derived without religion by simply trying to minimize suffering and maximize wellbeing. (thanks Sam!) The response for this was the predictable one - you still have to define wellbeing. I said that sure, intellectually that might be a valid criticism, but pragmatically in my life I don't have any trouble with the definition - I know it when I see it more or less. He said that the reason I see it is because I was raised in a Western culture based on christian ideas, for instance that all individuals have intrinsic value is a fundamentally christian idea.  

 I responded that I didn't think that was true, and that there were (for instance) some First Nations/Native American cultures that treated all individuals as having value. I also said that I didn't think it would matter even if it was originally a christian idea, because I think the principle can be derived from the fact that humans are biologically similar enough that they should all be treated the same/equitably.  (I don't think this was a strong/good argument on reflection.)

It was a long and wide ranging conversation, and I didn't want to be overly argumentative.

"You cannot question suffering because there is some divine wisdom behind it. (Response) I recently got this as a response to a question I asked on the problem of evil. 

The theist should understand that we have two different positions here. The theist believes his God exists with utmost certainty and on the other hand, an atheist or a non believer does not believe in the existence of God due to the lack of evidence. This non belief leads us to question the existence of God. Its obvious, when we have no evidence for God, we examine the claims made by theists. Attributes like ""All loving"" and ""all kind"" have been questioned in relation to the suffering we see all around the world in many forms. As a response to this, a theist attempt s to use the attribute ""All wise"" to set off the problematic questions we ask with regards to Gods all loving and all kind nature. He says that we their some wisdom behind all the sufferings we see and we do not have access to this wisdom.

Since Gods existence isnt concrete or even near to be strong in reality, we still can question his other attributes, even ""All wise"". If an all wise God did exist, will he allow suffering to be part of his grand plan ?

"Christians don't acknowledge that Faith is Wish Thinking. I've got a rant here.Christians, I need you to define what you think faith is.  Because the Bible defines faith as ""Now Faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen"" \[Heb 11:1\].  Without the flowery language, that means faith is feeling strongly about what you hope is true.  It's wish thinking.  So when Christians ask me why I don't have faith in \[x\], it's because I don't think that wishful thinking is a good way to live my life.

Now when I explain this to Christians, using their own book and terms, they think I'm being a smart ass.  I don't see how, I'm playing by their rules in the game they created.  Faith is wish-thinking.

Inevitably, I'll then hear some version of the following argument and it becomes painfully obvious that they don't understand that the word 'faith' has several meanings, and they are using it wrong when they talk about their beliefs.

Christian: ""Well you have faith that your airplane will arrive at an airport!""

I tell them that they are equivocating.  I tell them that the word faith has several meanings and that airlines aren't founded upon an assurance of hope that their planes will not crash.  And they call me a smart ass.

So I put it to you, Reddit.  Do they call me a smart ass because they don't understand the point I'm making, or are they deflecting because they recognize how silly it is to suggest that wishful thinking is a good method of dedicating your life to a Stone Age deity with a Bronze Age facelift?",atheism,t3_djfzls
"Bashing Conservapedia! https://www.conservapedia.com/Gender_confusion

&gt;Gender confusion or gender dysphoria is the problematic state of not realizing or finding it difficult to accept what gender a person is. It is common among people who choose to not adhere to traditional gender roles, such as homosexuals, transsexuals, transvestites and cross-dressers. Parents must make the roles of mother (=females) and father (=males) very clear, so that children can learn and affirm that there are differences between boys and girls. Under good parenting, the children will not become confused about gender.

In Chapter 33 known as al-Ahzab, verse 59, Allah gives the following command to Prophet Muhammad:

يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ, قُلْ لأَزْوَاجِكَ وَ بَنَاتِكَ وَ نِسآءِ الْمُؤْمِنِيْنَ: يُدْنِيْنَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِنْ جَلاَبِيْبِهِنَّ...

“O Prophet! Say to your wives, your daughters, and the women of the believers that: they should let down upon themselves their jalabib.”

What is the meaning of “jalabib”?

Jalabib جَلاَبِيْبٌ is the plural of jilbabجِلْبَابٌ , which means a loose outer garment. See any Arabic dictionary like Lisanu ’l-‘Arab, Majma‘u ’l-Bahrayn or al-Munjid.
Al-Munjid, for instance, defines jilbab as “the shirt or a wide dress—القميص أو الثوب الواسع.” While al-Turayhi, in Majma‘u ’l-Bahrayn, defines it as “a wide dress, wider than the scarf and shorter than a robe, that a woman puts upon her head and lets it down on her bosom...”5",atheism,t3_djeyad

"Voluntarily homeless ""missionary"" takes advantage of poor co-worker barely scraping by I work with the nicest elderly woman in the world. She's in her mid-70's, is disabled and we work in a warehouse environment. For story purposes, let's call her Jen. Jen lives in a rent-controlled senior apartment complex, and we get paid terribly for the hard work and long hours we put in. Jen is one of the hardest workers on the team, and despite being disabled, she goes above and beyond the physical duties the job requires (even though I have to intervene sometimes!). We're actually good friends despite the 50+ year age gap because we're so similar personality-wise and have a ton of common interests.

The main difference is I'm an agnostic atheist, and she's a gnostic theist. I've never told her as to avoid the inevitable conversion conversations that would follow, but I politely listen to her stories about how god talks to her. (god told me to do x, god told me to do y, etc... Just thoughts she has but thinks they're god telling her.) She's a hardcore believer despite never really read the bible, so most of her knowledge comes from Facebook articles (she told me they found Noah's Ark and some of Jesus' blood??) and projecting loving qualities onto an imaginary friend. She's so kind and has had an extremely rough life so I hate saying these things but this is necessary for the rant I'm about to get into.

A few weeks ago she tells me her daughter befriended a homeless lady (???) wanted the homeless lady to stay with her (???) and her husband wouldn't let her so she asked her elderly mother who's living paycheck to paycheck to have her stay with her (?!?!?!??!)

I asked her why the woman was homeless and guess what? She's \*voluntarily\* homeless to be a missionary! Apparently she's god's chosen child, and never has to work again a day in her life because god will provide strangers to give her a place to stay, food to eat, water to drink and clothes to wear. I got such a sick feeling and told her that isn't safe, and she deserves to be taken care of in her golden years, not to have to take care of someone who can obviously care for themselves but chooses not to. She said she's lived a great life and god told her to spread the love so she took this woman in.

So now my extremely naive friend, who is only able to make ends meet due to social security checks and exclusively eats food from the $0.99 store, is taking care of a grown ass woman who's delusional enough to think god says she's a chosen missionary, therefore can burden others. I asked her what she did for lunch last time we worked together, and it turns out instead of eating she went and bought nice toiletries for this woman. She knows I hate this arrangement and it's extremely unsafe because she has no idea who this lady actually is, and she told me, ""She's nice, like you! I can tell because you're both so kind."" She's known me for 5+ years, and this woman for maybe two weeks.

Religion is a cancer to all of society, but it can effect the kindest people in the worst ways. It can turn people who are otherwise rational and confident into ignorant fools. I just hope nothing happens to her, and this ""homeless"" woman moves the fuck on to her next sucker as soon as possible.

"Atheist methods of getting through rough point In the past weeks I have been starting to slip down a rough point and honestly my mental health has been deteriorating. I’m not in any danger but I’m not really doing okay either. 

It’s been so difficult that I cannot get work done that is ridiculously easy for me to do. It’s impacting whether or not I even get to class, and also severely impairing my social interactions.

Like, yesterday the amount of energy and absolute awfulness cumulated in me praying in a church and crying in front of a stranger? I’m an atheist who doesn’t express much emotion?

"How do you become an Atheist? So like 17 years ago when I was a teen, I kinda started thinking properly (well not all the times...) with my head. I've been a bit dubious of my religion, Catholicism , but living in Italy it was the norm to get all the sacraments and stuff, go to the church on Sunday because if you haven't gone ""people would talk"".

And one day when I was like 14 it happened, and it clicked. I was thinking ""wait, if people in ancient Greece or Rome or Egypt couldn't explain scientifically how things work and invented their religion, could it be that my religion was also invented for lack of knowledge?""

Maybe that could seem a bit stupid, but to 14 yo me it really helped my critical thinking and moved me forward to find more reasons and whatnot.

After years of thinking I understood that I became an Agnostic Atheist, but in the most recent years I'll say I'm 50/50 between Agnosticism and Gnosticism. I'm still on Agnosticism side because sometimes I think there could be a ""Creator"", more like a person running our universe on a PC simulation (damn you quantum physics!).

"Suicidal Thoughts So I am and An omniest that is I believe in the positive workable philosophical aspects of all religions but not quite the dogmatic. I’m also a law student and my background with the law serves largely as the basis for my question. My question is threefold:
First, how do atheists feel about suicide and whether or not it has any moral implications. 
My second question depends on the answer to the first question, which if it is as I suspect that it has no moral implications, being that it is a self directed act that hurts nobody I wonder if it is not possible for at least atheists to imagine a world where suicide could be a legal process that one could pursue, where one could legally follow a process to commit suicide. I imagine the process to involve some form of preliminary counselling and consultation with loved ones and a process of ensuring no creditors are prejudiced after which an assisted suicide could be administered by the state for any consenting adults in their right mental faculties. If not why not why not, and if it is because suicide does have moral implications for atheists I wonder why it would, even when in my scenario a consultation period with loved ones would preceded and suicidal and similarly creditors would be attended to if need be.",atheism,t3_djq7dv

"Religions beyond the supernatural: pseudo-religions Religion is any sort of faith-based belief system, that supposes that a supernatural agent, being, or entity exists and that the supernatural exists. Faith is a conviction in the absence or in spite of the evidence to the contrary. Supernatural can be defined as that which is beyond understanding or that which is unnatural. Any other belief system whether that shares only one, but not all of these traits are pseudo-religions.
Faith, in practice, is no different from self-deception; making yourself believe in things without parallel or without evidence.

We will look at one example for now. Conspricsm is the belief in a conspiracy. This is contrasted with conspiracy theories which have been shown an overwhelming preponderance of the evidence (proof). Conspiracism is faith-based in practice. The conspiracy in question is based on subjective impressions and blind speculation, not any sort of actual evidence. It is reinforced through willful ignorance and confirmation bias. Questioning is actively discouraged via the shill gambit, a logical fallacy. 

Conspiracists believe in some supernatural agent behind this conspiracy. This really no different from god; it is able to do anything it can, it knows everything, and is everywhere. But much like the god of the bible, it is strike contradiction with itself and reality. The great exception is that it is not worshipped any form, but it is fought against, like an imaginary foe, rather than a friend. We will call this the anti-god. Often, conspiracists are religious as well and use their holy texts to support their pre-assumed conclusion. This may be why conspiracism is not that much different from religions; one informs the other. They also apply their opinions and dislikes to their favored god and anti-god. God supports and likes whatever the believer likes and supports, and by contrapositive, the anti-god supports whatever believer dislikes and fights against.

Another thing conspiracists they share with the religious is the disregard for secular education. The reason is simple. They don't like that others are not being told and taught what they want to make-believe. Peer pressure alone can make some people break their belief, so everyone else must believe the same or else go extinct.",atheism,t3_djr04v

I used to have a fantastic argument; If you have studied evolution you will understand that 'species' is basically a rough term. Richard Dawkins discusses this extensively.

And since every 'human' is just an amalgamation of different traits and all humans are a different amalgamation of traits there is no 'first human' or 'perfect human or 'human' but instead just beings which share similarities.

I used this as a debunk of religion because since we are evolving and our minds are too, at what stage did God decide to end the fun? and make us all believe? and follow his rules?

"When the shit hits the fan... What are your coping mechanisms? Backstory:

Firstly, I have chronic mental illness and am a liberal. If I ever follow my family's religion of Christianity (to sometimes cope), it has always been from a liberal slant, which they don't adhere to.

I'm pretty much alone in some ways. At least locally. The Internet, I know, is full of like-minded people. :)

Secondly, I usually invoke any act of thanks or ""gratitude"" when I am feeling down more than when I feel up. (Am thinking that is partly the illness or religious programming perhaps?)

I don't expect a cure-all with this post, but I have noticed in the U.S., some middle ground as it pertains to belief (not that I am looking for middle ground... just saying). I refer to it in this way, because a lot of people just don't discuss atheism in person. I do see musicians refer to God or the ""heavens"" from time to time, and I can't imagine these guys struggling for years and years with this (as I have been). Maybe some do though.

Anyway, as Ive mentioned, I have, in the past, resorted to following Christianity (mainly because I received support from my family, and I truly needed support from them). This was largely before I met my fiancee, who supports any non-belief on my part, as well as, supports me in my day to day!

I personally have a lot of friends who I've talked to and they agree they are an atheist, but would never publicly say it because of the stereotype against us. I don't mean to offend anyone, I am just pointing out a trend. In my experience with Christians and growing up with Catholics. A lot of them thought and think they are better than every other religion. I feel like we are just as bad as them when we hear someone say they are religious and our first response is ""I disagree completely and here's why you sre wrong.""

"A language of our own. We know that  it is only a matter of time that Christianity will get so watered down that no one will notice it any longer.  But as religion loses it's sway on western civilization we must be ready to provide secular alternatives to speech regarding greetings, curses, and general religious expressions like ""thank god"" and ""Bless you"".  Atheism is the last and a much maligned minority.  We need a lexicon of words and expressions to represent the secular view.  Of course, like any other change in common language, such as, the evolution of non-sexist language and politically correct speech.  It always takes adjustment.  And I don't think that simply telling theists they're morons is productive, although there is an abundance of moron theists, there is also an abundance of intelligent theists who we would love to turn into free thinkers.

When someone says bless you, what should the atheist or agnostic say that doesn't sound reactionary or rude.  You can say thank you, but that isn't very satisfying to the atheist.  How about ""No, thank you"", and leave it at that.  What else is there?

"Rant about my Christian friend Basically, today during lunch break, my friends and I went to the school market to buy a jacket for Emma. My overly obsessive Christian friend, Josie, started talking about the Bible.

""Have you finished the Bible?"" she asked.

I replied, ""No."" I didn't tell her I was an atheist because I was afraid she would start lecturing me, despite us being the same age.

""Well, anyone who HASN'T finished the Bible is a SINNER,"" Josie declared. First of all, what the fuck. Second of all, she wasn't aware I was an atheist. I haven't heard any other Christians except her go on about this, so I was sure she was joking.

I just laughed and hoped she would move on. Then she added, ""I'm serious, God will explode you into little bits and you'll burn in hell."" Now, looking back, I think she was talking about SATAN, not her oh-so-perfect ""God"" who *loves* everyone. And threatening me with things that explosion won't make me any more religious. 

She started to babble about, ""When the end of the world comes, he'll curse us all with pollution, etc."" I didn't really understand that part because pollution exists, right now. Also, why the fuck would someone who ""loves"" everyone curse us? 

I told her to stop, and that I didn't believe in God. She said, ""well, at least *believe in one god.""* 

I wanted to tease her a bit, and asked, ""Which one?"" She answered, ""Christian. Of course."" She never gave context or reasons, just an answer. 

I asked her why, and I don't remember her answer because it was absurd and I quickly pushed it away, jokes aside. Then I asked her if all Christians were homophobic, as a joke. Holy shit, this bitch doesn't know what homophobic means. So I Googled it for her on my laptop, and she read the definition incorrectly, and said, ""Christians don't have a negative attitude!""

So is talking about how I'm going to ""explode into bits"" because I haven't read your outdated book that starts with a talking snake and a huge commotion over an apple 'positive' now?, I thought.

Then I corrected her, and she glared at me, and said, ""I *hate gay people.""* 

Maybe I asked the wrong question, but she definitely gave me the wrong answer. Honestly, Christians need some help. They should improve on convincing people. To convince me, I need proof, evidence, supporting evidence, a good conclusion, and a neutral attitude. Don't threaten me, and don't hate on my human rights. Or just leave me alone in the first place.

Also, I've never brought up atheism before. She just randomly talked about how if I hadn't read the entire Bible, I would explode into bits.",atheism,t3_diyhxc

"Being an atheist person of color is extremely frustrating at times One of the most frustrating things about being an atheist is having immigrant or non white parents. I live in Canada. We're not very religious as a whole country but many groups of people are. Most religious people here are Filipinos, Hispanics, Africans and Caribbean folks. There's also many Indians and others from the Middle East who strictly follow Islam or Christianity.

Growing up I went to a Catholic School that was publicly funded. It's how our system works unfortunately. Many of my friends had the same complaints as me. When you are part of these communities, it can be extremely difficult to be an atheist. Being black, there's an expectation that you will be a Christian. Black atheists are just so unheard of and my extended family would probably be deeply hurt if they discovered my beliefs. Same goes for Muslim, Filipino, Hispanic families etc. 

Now this isn't to discredit any else's experience especially if they're white. It's simply offering a different perspective. On top of all the challenges of being a black person, I also have to deal with the fact that I really have nobody in my community who is an atheist to share advice and experiences with. 

The most frustrating thing is that millions don't recognize that Christianity is a European religion that was manufactured and used to justify enslavement of Africans. The only reason why black Christians exist is because of slavery and colonization. It irks me even more when black people recognize this and convert to Islam.

"" Using the most recent national data (2005) from all U.S. states with information on sex education laws or policies (N = 48), we show that increasing emphasis on abstinence education is positively correlated with teenage pregnancy and birth rates. This trend remains significant after accounting for socioeconomic status, teen educational attainment, ethnic composition of the teen population, and availability of Medicaid waivers for family planning services in each state. These data show clearly that abstinence-only education as a state policy is ineffective in preventing teenage pregnancy and may actually be contributing to the high teenage pregnancy rates in the U.S.  ""

"The fallacy of the ""crackers in the pantry fallacy"" Last Sunday on the Atheist Experience a presuppositional apologist called and at some point during his several minutes of nonsense he claimed something was a ""crackers in the pantry fallacy"".  The hosts seemed to just dismiss this comment but this was new to me.  I did a quick search and it turns out this pseudo-fallacy was coined by (you guessed it) a presuppositional apologist named Greg Bahnsen during a debate with Gordon Stein in 1985.  His argument is:

&gt;We might ask, ""Is there a box of crackers in the pantry?"" And we know  how we would go about answering that question. But that is a far, far  cry from the way we go about answering questions determining the reality  of say, barometric pressure, quasars, gravitational attraction,  elasticity, radio activity, natural laws, names, grammar, numbers, the  university itself that you're now at, past events, categories, future  contingencies, laws of thought, political obligations, individual  identity over time, causation, memories, dreams, or even love or beauty.  In such cases, **one does not do anything like walk to the pantry and  look inside for the crackers**. There are thousands of existence or  factual questions, and they are not at all answered in the same way in  each case.

Basically this is a case of [special pleading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading) with regards to questions about the existence of god.  He's saying one cannot approach such questions the same way one could approach *other* factual questions, such as those dealing with ""barometric pressure"" or ""radio activity"".  For good measure, he throws in ""love"" and ""beauty"".  Can you see the problem with this? Bahnsen clearly fails to understand how one even begins to approach science.  Clearly we do not just peek outside and expect to perceive barometric pressure or radio activity with our hands and eyes; instead we utilize **instruments** that allow us to **observe these phenomena** as objectively as possible, and we rely on some agreed upon scale to convey this information.  With these tools, we do (for practical purposes) walk to the pantry and look inside for the crackers.  If we had accurate instruments to measure something like ""love between two individuals"" (e.g.: hormonal response, emotional attachment, etc.) or ""a sculpture's beauty"" (e.g.: symmetry, composition, etc.) we could do the same thing.  These are all factual questions that can all be answered in the same way: by ""looking"", with the appropriate method, and receiving consistent observations if they in fact exist.

But Bahnsen needs to claim god's existence must be approached differently, because it clearly is not factual.  He claims:

&gt;In short, there is no shortage of empirical indicators or evidences of  God's existence - from the thousand stars of the heavens to the 500  witnesses of Christ's resurrection. But, Dr. Stein precludes the very  possibility of any of this empirical evidence counting as proof for  God's existence

Not surprisingly, a christian who does not understand what evidence is (the stars, really? also, a thousand?) - although a bit surprising since Bahnsen apparently studied epistemology.  This brand of presuppositionalism claims that atheists are inherently wrong in whatever they say because they accept logic which is immaterial while requiring a factual proof for god, and that scientists have some secret agenda to purposefully exclude supernatural explanations (some even go into the conspiracy theory territory).  I probably do not need to tell you this, but logic as well as scientific and mathematical models of nature are not physical entities yet they are useful, can be verified and produce explanations and predictions.  If we can explain a process it is not really supernatural, is it?

If you watched the debate between presuppositional apologist Sye Ten Bruggengate and functional human being Matt Dillahunty you can tell the entire argument of presuppositional apologetics is ""god exists, anything else, therefore god exists"".  This ""crackers in the pantry"" stupidity is yet another way to claim god must exist but cannot be subjected to any kind of rigorous examination (or any kind of questioning).

I am not one to actively seek to debate christians, much less this kind, but they are a tricky, weasely bunch.  Any thoughts on this or experiences dealing with similar arguments?",atheism,t3_diw574

"i want to tell my parents that i’m atheist but i’m scared to as i’m writing this, i’ve got a huge headache and i just came from stupid fucking church school, so sorry if there isn’t much context and grammar is total shit

i’ve been (and currently am) raised catholic by my mother and stepfather. we go to church every sunday and on christian holidays, and i go to an after-school bible study on wednesdays. i’ve been contemplating my religion for about a year, maybe a year and a half, and i’ve come to the conclusion that i believe in none of the bullshit. 

naturally, i want to politely tell my mom and stepdad that i’d like to be excluded from  everything religious, but i’m honestly scared to. i can say that they’re not the most involved in the church, but they’re firm believers in the religion. i don’t want my mother to come to the conclusion that somehow the media and my phone has rotted my brain or something. i can already see it, she’s yelling at me for actually coming to my senses and snapping out of the bullshit. i’m just some stupid 14 year old kid that doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

here’s where i come to gain a little hope, though. i came out to my mother as transgender (let’s not get into the conversation of whether or not children can know if they’re transgender or not, i just ask you to respect me. i am MtF if that gives a little clarity, so my mother still refers to me as female), and she actually seemed pretty supportive. she’s let me cut my hair, i have more guys clothing, and i really don’t think i’ve ever been happier. i have a hunch that she also knows i’m bisexual, but i haven’t explicitly told her, but i’d like to think she knows and supports me. her church is pretty homophobic, so knowing this, she might oppose some of their views.

don’t get me wrong, i have nothing wrong with religious people as long as they’re not complete dicks. hell, i implore people to seek out religion of it genuinely makes them happy. but it doesn’t bring that satisfaction to me. i don’t want to live in constant fear of some sky daddy who’s watching my every action, slowly becoming more anxious because anything i do can upset him. 

either she’s going to fully support me as an atheist, or she’s not going to at all. i have confirmation classes next year, so i’m going to have to spill the beans soon anyways because there’s no way i’m being confirmed. do you guys have any advice?

edit for a little more info: another reason why i’m scared is because i’ve seen so many people share their stories of being thrown out for their religious beliefs, and it makes me a little paranoid. it’s terrifying, i don’t have many people to run to. i don’t know my dad’s views on religion (nor my grandpa), my grandma and other grandpa are also very religious, my best friend is very christian, and i have really one person i can run to (another friend), but i don’t know him too well and i don’t think his family could even support me. aaaa",atheism,t3_diyef5

"How religion poisons everything. Yesterday I wrote about the plight of some women in Western countries with a Christian culture, but Islam is much worse. There are many different types of Muslims but some years ago I worked with a small group of North African women. I was warned by my boss to avoid any discussion about religion.

The first thing I noticed that during my meetings (I am male) with these 5 women, an Arab man stood outside the door (it had a glass panel) watching what was happening. Women are not trusted to be alone with a man, so everyday, every minute and every hour, a male relative of one of these women kept watch.

One day I asked them to prepare some material for our next meeting and they complained that they did not have enough time. I asked them why they had no time seeing that they were going to their flats in the early afternoon. One of them told me that they have to wash clothes, clean the house and cook. ""Can't your brother wash and cook?"" I asked her. She looked shocked and said "" But he is a man!"" The thing is that women are not allowed to travel alone so a brother or another relative has to accompany them. In this case the male relatives spent the time lazing about and took it in turns to come and keep watch on us.

They also asked me during our first meeting whether I believed in Mohammed. As I had been warned about this I told them "" I respect him"". But they were not happy with this "" We believe in Jesus, you should believe in Mohammed"". It took me a lot of self restraint and mental agility to get out of the situation.",atheism,t3_dipzox

"Waffling on Coming Out I've read the FAQ. I've done a search within this sub. But I don't see any instances of my specific concerns regarding coming out. 

I've recently come to understand that there is no proof for a God. I was raised Church of Christ and lived my entire life up until a few months ago for it - I'm 32. 

I know I ultimately have no obligation to tell anyone about me no longer being a Christian. I'm an adult, and have my own life with my husband. However, I have a very good and very close relationship with my Christian parents. I am active in my church - Sunday mornings, evenings, and Wednesday nights. Lately I've been scaling back on Sunday nights - which results in awkward chiding from the people who think I should be there. I currently am the teacher for 4th-6th graders on Wednesday nights. I have friends who actively check on me if I miss to make sure I'm okay. It would be obvious if I just left and never came back. Basically there will be things I'll need to deal with in order to walk away. I have no fears that I'm wrong or that maybe God does exist - I just worry about the emotional and relational fallout that may come with this. I'm also not ready for the long discussions that my dad will definitely want to have on the topic once he finds out.

The go-getter in me just wants to say, ""okay this is what I believe now, and here we go!"" and jump right into just not partaking in anything religious because it just feels like a waste of my time. But I also feel like the blow will be softened if I slowly start backing off.

The idea that only a religious person can be a good person is utterly ridiculous. In fact, perhaps it is the Atheists who are the truly good people; we try to do what is right not for the selfish reason of fear of some afterlife punishment but because we the know it is the right thing to do.""

"[Serious] - How the hell is Christianity possibly still a thing when it's clearly disproved? God is indisputably disproved by the existence of evil alongside a all-knowing, all-powerful, all-loving god.  We know that prayer blatantly does not work and we can demonstrably test it anywhere at anytime with the ""curing cancer"" argument.  In addition, the Bible includes a lengthy ruleset of guidelines on how one should go about enslaving others and their families, as well as guidelines on keeping women inferior to men.  The Bible on many occasions shows God regularly defending sinners/frauds (see Abraham lying multiple times in Genesis with God punishing those Abraham knowingly decieved) and includes flat out ludicrous stories like Noah's Ark which has effectively been proved impossible.

"Thoughts on getting preachy I've been struggling with something of an ethical dilemma lately, and I'd like to hear other people's thoughts.

I lost my bff of 20 years to cancer this year.  It was tough of course, but more so because she was very much into all the snake-oil, ""alternative medicine"" anti-science stuff, and opted out of chemo/radiation and surgical options until it was way too late.   At the time, I bit my tongue, because I felt I had to respect her right to make her own choices about her medical care, and I knew she already knew how I felt.  Now, looking back, I'm beating myself up a lot, because maybe if I'd said more, pushed hard, gotten preachy she would have made some different choices, and still be alive.  And that would have been worth any anger she felt or any damage it did to our relationship.    I was watching some episodes of the The Atheist Experience yesterday, and started to relate this experience to the theists who are so desperate to save souls that sometimes they end completely destroying relationships with their atheist friends and family, and I'm feeling a lot of empathy for them.  

I'm not sure what answers I'm looking for here.  I guess my main question would be am I missing something in my thought process? I know I'm not exactly at my most rational right now.

"Thoughts on the potential growth of Wicca/Neopaganism? First of all, let me start by saying that I am unaffiliated and do not consider myself an atheist or Wiccan. I am, however, curious as to how atheists would view an increase in the Neopagan population.

Wicca is often cited as the fastest growing religion in American (though it's obviously much easier for a small organization to achieve high relative growth compared to a large one that's mostly reached market saturation), and with a growing increase in feminism and environmentalism, it seems to me that a more female-friendly, nature-worshipping religion is likely to do well in the coming decades. It's non-dogmatic and 'open-source', making it more appealing to freethinkers, it's morality (an it harm done, do as thou wilt) is more in line with modern morality, and the gods are not necessarily literal beings but simply representations of a pantheistic godhead. 

This further synchronizes with a probable psychedelic renascence, which will likely promote New Age beliefs over secular ones, with at least one study claiming that a majority of atheists change their positions after a powerful psychedelic experience (see below). I also think that the empowerment of women which helps Wicca may hinder atheism, as women are statistically more spiritual/religious than men. A growth in 'post-empirical science'  dealing with mulitverses, consciousness, ontology, etc, may further undermine a purely rational view of reality and favour New Age 'woo'. 

Atheism is also projected to decline demographically on the global scale simply due to birth rates. Atheists since at least Voltaire have expected religion to die off due simply to education and reason, but ironically, that no longer appears to be an evidence based view. In the most extreme scenario, I think the abuses of the atheistic Chinese government against religious minorities may even sour some people on the ideology, being far more recent than the abuses of the Catholic Inquisition.

My apologies for the lengthy preamble. My question is this; is a Neopagan revival, from an atheistic stand-point, preferable to the status quo of Evangelical Christians? As mentioned, it seems that Wiccans avoid a lot of the issues that atheists have with fundamentalist Christianity and Islam. They're progressive, non-dogmatic, and have no problem with their gods and myths being non-literal.  

Very interested to hear others thoughts on this.

"My therapist asked me to write this letter to my 14 year old self to help me recover from a sexual assault I survived at the time. This is why I’m an atheist and I’m sorry if this is the wrong place for this. [20m] Dear Daniel,
	Back in february I remembered. That thing that you went through but were too young to comprehend, to see it for what it was. I remember that night, how you felt so surrounded yet so alone. I remember how you woke up on the tile of that cold living room floor all alone not knowing what had happened but knowing that your body knew something. That your body felt like it was collapsing in on itself like one of the world trade center towers at the center of its mass, making your heart beat so fast that you started seeing specks of light and darkness instead of the popcorn ceiling you were facing. I remember how you started to feel your legs again, got up, and began to move towards the door only to be dissuaded and physically prevented from leaving and by those two guys sitting on the couch behind you shrouded in the darkness. 
	I sympathize with you, I really do. Your pain is my pain and that’s just a fact. But I simply don’t know how to forgive you for being so fucking stupid that honestly I wonder if you were missing a chromosome or two at that age. Let alone that you didn’t leave before it happened. But that even after, though you didn’t know what really had happened. You refused to listen to the primordial instinct of fight or flight. You ignored your body despite the fact that it gave you every biochemical indication to get the fuck out of there. That you could feel so pressured by social status and a yearning for friendship to get back on the floor is so beyond my comprehension despite that everyday I get a little closer to comprehending your actions, I think. It is such a strange feeling. To know your pain but feel estranged from it. To know why you did what you did but to feel so far from understanding it at the same time. To be you and not to be you.  And to finally see what you did not though I’m beginning to understand that your lack of comprehension was a matter of capacity not one of willful ignorance but still I think that they're one in the same.
	I remember the next morning how they’re laughs woke you up at eight am sharp from the same spot on the living room floor that you had retreated back to.  Moving toward them and the phone they were surrounded around as they continued to laugh so hard it was clear it was making it hard for them to catch your breath. Moving toward them, driven not by curiosity but anxiety. And having that anxiety confirmed when you saw his genitalia on your unconscious face that was so clearly you in the video. The only thing I feel able to commend you on was your inability to look at that video for more than two seconds. While we surely don’t know what else he did or what those other people saw and recorded. I thank you for preserving at least some of our ability to sleep through the night. 
	I understand this but its hard to sympathize. How you failed to reconginze that this was sexual assault and how you refrused to tell anyone to preserve these frindships that were clearly never friendships to begin with but ways for you to self-medicate. l I’m so angry that aside from your silence and complacency, you stayed almost two hours after to absorb all the humiliation that lingered in that apartment. Retracting again to that same place on the living room floor to allow shame and what you had just seen reverberate throughout the contents of your cranium. You should've just left but you just had to ask him why he did that and ask her why she recorded it knowing you weren’t going to get a remedial response. 
      Today, I’m ninety days sober and staying sober with the help of an out-patient program at the LGBT center in manhattan. It’s the longest I’ve ever been sober since it happened. Something you should’ve done sooner let alone your preference to keep buying drugs from your attacker to prop up the facade that everything was fine. I’m seeing a therapist regularly who is helping me shift through this bullshit yet I have yet to overcome this inability to forgive you or even regard your naivety with less resentment. I’m finally doing what you should’ve done as soon as you saw that video and have begun pressing charges or at least am trying to. 
       I know this happened when we were fourteen but from what I recall you already knew how cruel the world was, hence why you had to change in the bathroom stall instead of the locker room and how being tortured at school was only met with familial distress at home that hindered anytime to recuperate before the cycle started at seven-twenty am the next school say. I don’t understand why you thought going to a party and drinking and smoking so much would be the kind of reprieve you were looking for. And even though you saw those two seconds of that video, remaining ignorant from the rest of what he did, in what will be six years ago on November twenty fourth. I only just remembered that night a few months ago, how they thought you would like having that done to yourself, and how a few weeks later in school you deleted that video from her phone only to watch her recover it with a grin on her face. And because of this it feels like it just happened. Like it was only yesterday that I walked home with the weight of the world on my shoulders, facing the impending doom of the possibility that video would be something everyone at your school would soon have on their phones. I’m so angry at your inability to deal with this sooner. But above all, I can’t believe you thought it would be safe to tell them you were gay.

"In a relationship with a Christian girl, need help/advice on how to deal with an issue I'm sorry for the mess this post is, I'm writing down my thoughts because I don't know what else to do. I understand this probably belongs in a relationships sub but I didn't get much of a response there. Please help me out.

Me [18M] and my girlfriend [18F] have been together for quite some time now. We're both quite inexperienced, but until recently we have had an amazingrelationship. We love and respect one another and would do anything for each other.

However, every time we get intimate she feels guilty afterwards. She's a christian, and whenever we do anything sex-related she really enjoys it, but afterwards she feels terrible - she thinks that by feeling pleasure she's done something horribly wrong and sinful and she breaks down, cries and starts hitting herself and calling herself a slut and many other bad things.

It's been causing us problems and making us both feel horrible.
I've tried talking with her, tried explaining to her that sex is a loving, bonding experience between two people who love and care for each other, that there's nothing ""wrong"" about it. She agrees with me that making love is something special and she says she has no problems with the act itself, but with the fact that it's premarital.

We're still too young to consider marriage, and even if we were not, the thought of spending my life with someone who is unhappy after every time we are intimate makes me feel hopeless. I don't believe that, as if by magic, all her guilt and shame would go away if we were married. She however reassures me the opposite is true.

We tried not doing anything sex related for some time and it was very hard for both of us. She has a high sex drive and often initiates first, no matter how bad it makes her feel afterwards. For me personally, love and intimacy are something I must have in a relationship and sleeping together is an important part of it. But I hate making her feel so horrible afterwards.

I feel like I've hit a wall. I don't know how to proceed. If we abstain from making love, I feel terrible and hence she feels terrible because she knows how I feel. If we do get intimate, then she feels terrible because she thinks it's sinful and thus I feel terrible as well.

I have no idea what do to. I hate making her feel guilty and I've suggested that maybe it would be better for her if we split up, but she heavily disagrees and says she would do anything for me to stay with her, she says she would be far worse-off without me. I don't want to leave her either, I love her and want to make her feel safe. She makes me happy and I want to make her happy as well.

What can we do? Would relationship therapy help? We're students so we don't exactly have that much money to pay for it. She's truly an amazing person and we have a really great thing together if not for this problem. Help of any kind would be very much appreciated.

&gt;""Yes you are, half the Bible is metaphors and honestly it's the best part of the Bible, it shows you how your supposed to live your life and is up to you on how you interpret it.""

And personally, I couldn't agree more. Half of the Bible is metaphors (obvious or useless), and the other half is composed of the rambling drivel of many a great man who believed that women were property and slavery was A-okay.  

And ignoring all the parts about magic food and hearing voices from god, a story about a guy not feeling so hopeless because he managed to find and eat some food during a time when people were dying left and right from disease and starvation is really not that amazing. There is no worthwhile message from this story other than ""food and naps are good!"". And really, what toddler doesn't already know that? Of course, I'm sure your average, thoughtful, knowledgeable Christian would tell me I'm oversimplifying the story and tell me the real point is that ""god gives and if you choose to accept his gifts you will feel better"" - but as we all know, God doesn't exist and neither does Santa Claus.

"Help, I need some deeper insights regarding issues. *(Sorry for my english, it's not my first language.)*

I like reading about ancient history and how humans became what they are today, and my mom and I watched something about history. I just find it kind of funny how my mother told me that the bible is written by scholars and that it's accurate and everything written there correlated to actual events in history. 

I explained to my mom how I find it weird that if the bible is written by scholars, why did they disregard scientific knowledge on stars and Math. The measuring sequence in the bible is different from what was standard by that era. Never mentioned the pyramids and the floods are all recorded by these civilizations. 

It's just that out of frustration I just told my mom, if the bible was so accurate, why can't they tell the difference between a comet and meteor shower, events that those ancient civilizations keep track off. They know planets and have names for them. They know the difference of planets and stars FFS! 

Can someone send a link where I can find more about a condensed version of all ancient scientific advancements regarding math, architecture and sciences. I need to start making a print out of it so I could show my mom. lol",atheism,t3_dip9bc

"I need advice from people who use logic, and not god Okay so, I'm a dreamer. I think up crazy ideas in my head and see if I can somehow make them into something real. Of course I'll come across as dumb so I'm leaving that informational tangent there.

I told my mother about one of the ideas I had, A.I. deprived from N.I. (Natural Intelligence). Basically the prerequisites would be a nanorobotic organism (A organism made up of billions of miniscule robots that techinally fulfil the requirements for being an organism, btw cells are hard to classify so yes it would fit into that catagory), and a human. Aini, as I call it, would pose no risk if the human that gives Aini it's knowledge has a non-violent goal. What I want the non-violent goal to be is to take over the human race, not forcefully of course but with pull-factors; You see Aini would be able to manipulate chemistry at a small level, allowing it to create food from various materials, it may be slow but food is food. Obviously water, shelter (A type of shelter that moves with you and generates the rooms as you walk to make it so that you could have a ""1 million square foot house"" in about 25 square feet), transportation, entertainment, education, and tasks (Just small things to keep you busy and give you a positive goal) will be provided. Unfortunately, from what my mother tells me, there are some push factors; Aini will know everything you do, think or say simply by analyzing your brain(it's more accurate the younger you start being monitored), Aini will kill you if you hurt someone (on purpose, with the intention of hurting them without any idea of how it might benefit them), and finally Aini will force ANYONE to get a proper education, if you are taking too much time and simply being hardheaded, for no GOOD reason, you will be killed.

So my mother says this is immoral and that ""Only god should be allowed to decide if you should die."" I frankly hate that because of the fact that god can't decide shit, and he hasn't done shit. Also because if you hurt someone, simply because you could and it seemed appealing to you, isn't that evil? Shouldn't ACTUAL evil be destroyed without sympathy? Not by humans but by a computer that will take in everything?

If he were the family pet, Papa would have been euthanized yesterday after the chaplains bullshit bedside service so as to end the pain and let him pass with the remaining little bit of dignity he has.

Drowning in the mucus accumulating in his lungs while waiting for his heart to stop, is not how my grandfather wants to die!! Worse still is the family knows this, but isn't willing to use modern medicine to let him go, only to try to save him.

"Super religious parents are okaying terrible racist behaviour because ""Not all Chritsians are perfect."" At dinner the other night my parents were discussing a new black girl at their church that had started dating a white boy who also goes to church (were a white family, not that it matters that much). My mother mentioned something about how the boy was too afraid to introduce his parents, who lived across the country, to her as they definitely wouldn't approve of their relationship. I prodded them about it asking if both of their parents also go to church and read the bible etc. and after answering ""Yes, of course they do why wouldn't they?"" I asked them ""Well, doesn't the bible teach acceptance? Why would they get angry if the son really did love the daughter instead of chasing her away?"". My stepdad looked at me like he was about to beat me into acceptance with a bible and said: ""CharlieGGx I think one horrible misconception you have of Christians is that we're not all perfect and we're allowed to have our own opinions.""

The problem with that statement is that it had only recently clicked that they've been doing this for years with not only me but in their own marriage, to other people, in their everyday lives. It makes me so sick that I, raised in a super religious household, feel like I'm living by the basic rules better than my parents are.

"The greatest crime or flaw of any god is the unwillingness or inability to interfere in stopping the evils of his/her own followers. One of my best friends was disowned by her own parents just for saying she no longer felt she could believe in a god. Hers is just one of the countless stories out there of young adults and children who are abandoned, abused, tortured, or outright killed because of some religious fanatic claiming god willed it. If you believe in a god that would let this happen, your god is a weak piece of absolute shit. I can understand a god wanting to test people’s faith. I can understand a god wanting to give people free will. I can almost (almost) understand a god that gives children cancer. But seriously? Your god doesn’t have the decency or the mind to tell his own followers, the people that already believe in him/her and are representatives of that god “No, that’s fucked up”? How pathetic is your god exactly?

“Oh, but those aren’t true believers. They’ve misinterpreted god’s will.”  
 Yeah? And who’s fault is that? The apostles? Muhammad? Joel Osteen? Somewhere along the way the chain of communication got screwed up, and of course it sounds like theists want to blame anyone but the omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent being who started the whole thing and has a 'clear message' to give.

“If god interfered, he’d be taking away people’s free will.”   
 How exactly? They already believe in him, and they’re taking advice from a 2,000+ year old book. If they’re that easily swayed, why can’t God just send a bird down with a fortune cookie that says something like “Don’t abuse your kid.” Or if he knows them and has a personal relationship with them, surely he would know what would sway them without interfering with their free will. Whether or not god likes it, he forced himself on people’s free will long ago when he started giving people the choice to worship him or spend eternity in fire.

‘Well, those people that abandon god, deserve to be disowned or abused. They’ve turned against god, and they’re getting the tough love that they need to learn the error of their ways.”  
 This response is why it’s stereotypical for religious people to be viewed as unintelligent. If your child turns ‘away from god’, and you think the best way to get them to believe again is by being an abusive asshole, then congratulations. Not only have you proven what an absolute dick your god is, but also that the very belief system you uphold is immoral and counteractive to its own message of love and compassion.

“What those people do is terrible, and I don’t know why god would allow it, but he knows better than we do.”  
 Does he though? Seriously, ask any non-believer how they would react if they were god and they found out their own followers were disowning or abusing their own children. I guarantee they’d have a far more just and intelligent response than a pack of she-bears or a 40 day flood. It’s not that hard if you think about it more from an actual god-like perspective, and less from a state of ignorance.

Your god can’t control free will? I get it. Your god can’t control natural disasters? Fine. Your god can’t control eye parasites? Fair enough. Your god can’t control the very people who claim to believe in him and are willing to do pretty much anything to follow his command? What good is your fucking god, exactly?

TL;DR: If your god exists, he is either too weak or apathetic to stop his own followers when they do wrong in his name. Not only does this make him a pathetic excuse for any god, but it also makes him a terrible leader and communicator. As far as I can tell, there is no valid justification or reason to call a being that fails at this simple undertaking ‘god’.",atheism,t3_dijub9

"Just got out of a heated conversation with my Christian parents and could use some advice I'm a grown-up, but only officially cut ties with the church this summer. Both parents are faithful fundamentalists. I've read the ""telling parents"" page.

So, we've decided to keep communication channels open on the topic of religion. The issue we're facing is that my parents are actively trying to convert me and all I want is to communicate what I believe. Different goals, you see. I spent a few years being dodgy and avoiding talking about religion at all because I couldn't afford to be outed but am now in a position where it doesn't matter. But now, it's very easy for my parents to see what I don't believe but much less clear to my parents what I *do* believe. As a result, my dad has been pretty on me about communicating with him about the things that I believe, which is justified because there was a span of several years where I simply wouldn't have.

Last week, I constructed a powerpoint (I know how extra that sounds) which step by step breaks down how I evaluate conflicting claims. This wasn't to initiate a debate, this wasn't to convert my parents, none of that. All I wanted to do was demonstrate ""when asked about whether a global flood did or did not occur, here is how I would begin investigating"" and I think my parents get that. I really, really think they understand my powerpoints rhetorical function. The issue we're facing is that now that they've read my thing, neither of us have ANY idea how to talk to each other in a way that isn't a debate. They're sending me apologetics articles and we got into an hour-long phone call, which basically boiled down to ""you need faith"" to fill in the gaps in the archeological or geological record on top of the bad science they've proposed.

Finally, during a heated moment, they asked me why I don't believe in the bible is an inspired text and I snapped and just laundry listed:

* When sorted chronologically, ideas such as hell are demonstrated to develop over time
* The evolution of the biblical canon is arbitrary and unnecessary in the case of an omnipotent curator
* How you gonna say there was a firmament for 1/6th of the earth's life span, but no evidence of it existing
* Where the marsupial fossils in Turkey/Mt Ararat tho?

and a whole mess of other things that are just not helpful.

But holy *shit* I just really felt like I needed to finally say it. They keep saying ""atheists can't explain this, atheists can't explain that there's all this evidence, look at the archeology"" and on and on. The weird thing is, I can't believe I snapped. Being an atheist is NOT an important part of my identity. I don't care in 99.99% of cases but something about talking to my parents really gets to me. I need help or guidance or something from someone who's been where I am because I don't want to convince anyone of anything I just want to feel heard and I don't want to fight them but I feel so much hostility and feel so reactive. Honestly, it's possible and likely that I'm the one bringing animosity into these conversations, but I don't know how to know.

I'm not *not* going to talk to them. That might be the smart thing, but I'm going to continue talking to them anyway. If that's a bad idea, how can I do this bad idea as safely as possible?

The truth is, I don't really know what I'm asking, but I know I need help even if I don't know how to ask for it. I'm just SO so so so frustrated. Has someone here been there done that? I don't know what to do and am still wound up.

"Help Malta, a small EU country, help women who are being denied their rights.  

Malta  is very advanced in its civil rights. With one exception: Abortion.  While the general population and also women enjoy many rights which are  not even available in other Western countries, there has always been a  large (but it is getting smaller) strident majority who persecute anyone  who even tries to discuss abortion rights. Any form of abortion FOR ANY  REASON is a criminal offense. A doctor may not even recommend an  alternative solution, such as traveling to nearby Sicily (a 30 minute  flight, or a 90 minute catamaran journey away) and give the name of a  reputable clinic. If a Matese doctor as much as suggests this he is  liable to prosecution. Doctors are afraid because the pregnant woman  standing in front of them could be an under cover journalist for one of  the conservative media houses.

However,  our progressive prime minister is giving signs that he is ready to  start the discussion (He cannot come out and say ' ready to grant full  reproductive rights). Please support a facebook group by liking, sharing  posts and writing how backwards Malta is in this regard. The group is  being financed by a group of Maltese pro-choice doctors:  Drs4ChoiceMalta

However, those people MUST have known loved ones who went to hell for not believing in 'god' or 'sinning'. How is heaven so happy and, well, heavenly, when those people have to dwell on the sadness of never seeing those people again?

"The Dragon In My Garage by Carl Sagan 
""A fire-breathing dragon lives in my garage""
Suppose (I'm following a group therapy approach by the psychologist Richard Franklin) I seriously make such an assertion to you. Surely you'd want to check it out, see for yourself. There have been innumerable stories of dragons over the centuries, but no real evidence. What an opportunity!

""Show me,"" you say. I lead you to my garage. You look inside and see a ladder, empty paint cans, an old tricycle--but no dragon.

""Where's the dragon?"" you ask.

""Oh, she's right here,"" I reply, waving vaguely. ""I neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon.""

You propose spreading flour on the floor of the garage to capture the dragon's footprints.

""Good idea,"" I say, ""but this dragon floats in the air.""

Then you'll use an infrared sensor to detect the invisible fire.

""Good idea, but the invisible fire is also heatless.""

You'll spray-paint the dragon and make her visible.

""Good idea, but she's an incorporeal dragon and the paint won't stick.""

And so on. I counter every physical test you propose with a special explanation of why it won't work.

Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true. Claims that cannot be tested, assertions immune to disproof are veridically worthless, whatever value they may have in inspiring us or in exciting our sense of wonder. What I'm asking you to do comes down to believing, in the absence of evidence, on my say-so.

The only thing you've really learned from my insistence that there's a dragon in my garage is that something funny is going on inside my head. You'd wonder, if no physical tests apply, what convinced me. The possibility that it was a dream or a hallucination would certainly enter your mind. But then, why am I taking it so seriously? Maybe I need help. At the least, maybe I've seriously underestimated human fallibility.

Imagine that, despite none of the tests being successful, you wish to be scrupulously open-minded. So you don't outright reject the notion that there's a fire-breathing dragon in my garage. You merely put it on hold. Present evidence is strongly against it, but if a new body of data emerge you're prepared to examine it and see if it convinces you. Surely it's unfair of me to be offended at not being believed; or to criticize you for being stodgy and unimaginative-- merely because you rendered the Scottish verdict of ""not proved.""

Imagine that things had gone otherwise. The dragon is invisible, all right, but footprints are being made in the flour as you watch. Your infrared detector reads off-scale. The spray paint reveals a jagged crest bobbing in the air before you. No matter how skeptical you might have been about the existence of dragons--to say nothing about invisible ones--you must now acknowledge that there's something here, and that in a preliminary way it's consistent with an invisible, fire-breathing dragon.

Now another scenario: Suppose it's not just me. Suppose that several people of your acquaintance, including people who you're pretty sure don't know each other, all tell you that they have dragons in their garages--but in every case the evidence is maddeningly elusive. All of us admit we're disturbed at being gripped by so odd a conviction so ill-supported by the physical evidence. None of us is a lunatic. We speculate about what it would mean if invisible dragons were really hiding out in garages all over the world, with us humans just catching on. I'd rather it not be true, I tell you. But maybe all those ancient European and Chinese myths about dragons weren't myths at all.

Gratifyingly, some dragon-size footprints in the flour are now reported. But they're never made when a skeptic is looking. An alternative explanation presents itself. On close examination it seems clear that the footprints could have been faked. Another dragon enthusiast shows up with a burnt finger and attributes it to a rare physical manifestation of the dragon's fiery breath. But again, other possibilities exist. We understand that there are other ways to burn fingers besides the breath of invisible dragons. Such ""evidence""--no matter how important the dragon advocates consider it--is far from compelling. Once again, the only sensible approach is tentatively to reject the dragon hypothesis, to be open to future physical data, and to wonder what the cause might be that so many apparently sane and sober people share the same strange delusion.",atheism,t3_di2oum

"My wife seems hell-bent on indoctrinating our son, and it may lead to divorce. We are both immigrants from different countries. I sponsored her to the US, after I made it clear that I didn't subscribe to any religion. If that was important, please marry someone else and please learn English. In her country, she wasn't particularly religious, and dressed suggestively. I told her to tone it down. But I could understand going to church on Sunday, and resuming our regular lives afterwards. 

She came here in 2012. We had a son in 2015. The first year after that was fine.

 In 2016, she started in this new church where they teach that Jesus put the moon in the sky.  They don't have a church building, and they rent space in a high school. She likes this church better, it seems, because she gets cheap prominence. This year, she said she was studying to be a disciple. In June, she graduated. 

I also suspect she has been recruited into a pyramid scheme operating out of that church. This wouldn't be the first time. The congregants, when they troop out, don't look educated. It is that bad. I was really unhappy and told her so. In her old church, they had free English lessons and  a mixed congregation. She has made no progress towards learning English. The first part of the year, she left home several nights a week to go dancing in the church.

In 2017, as I was dropping her off in this new church, she snatched our son off his car-seat and started running into the church. Unbeknownst to me, she had unbelted him while the car was in motion. This was in violation of a promise she made to me just 15 minutes earlier to not do so. I ran after her and retrieved him. I put him back in his seat, and as I was driving off, I was surrounded by a group of men who blocked me in so I couldn't leave. I called 911, and they dispatched some officers. Before they arrived, some lady who identified herself as a ""youth pastor"" came over to the car and accused me of wanting to raise my son, ""the way you want!"" I politely tried to explain that I prefer to raise him without religion. She was soon to get nervous and walked away as police showed up. I took my son to the playground.

Recently, she bought him a children's Bible which I threw away yesterday, and sneaks him to religious events when I'm at work. One occasion they brought him back in a vehicle, sitting on his car-seat which wasn't buckled down. I warned the lady to never again come into my house.

In 2017, I found out the closest thing to that though. March For Science had their first march that year and I got their ""Science Not Silence"" T-shirt.

I went out to eat afterwards and a guy in line asked what church I go to. A few weeks later, a restaurant employee asked if I ""believe in Darwinism."" An employee at an adventure park while I was on vacation asked if I knew who Jesus was.

It's thrown me off every single time because 
1. Even having lived in the Bible belt my whole life, complete strangers have never approached me about religion before.
2. I don't associate science with religion or lack thereof. I've known Christian and Muslim scientists. Years of university insulated me from that mindset the general public has. I forgot about how weirdly controversial science is outside of academia in the Bible belt.

"Argument against a god being the ultimate observer I've heard an argument for God (sometimes panpsychism, sometimes monotheistic apologetics) based on the idea that everything is just waves until it's observed and that without an observer (ala Heisenberg), nothing would exist (or firm-up - (have a known position)) until it is observed. Because things exist way outside the scope of observers, an all-seeing observer, god, must be the one to make the observation.

Only one problem. If god does observe all, therefore bringing it into being, then we'd never be able to do a double slit experiment and we'd probably not understand (whatever we actually do understand of)  wave/particle dualism. In effect, god's observation would change the observable laws of physics so that we'd know nothing of the waves.

One counter argument might be that god knows when we're trying to observe waves and allows them to persist until we do the observation. That could be, except then you have to throw out the ""uniformity of nature"" argument and accept that god does change the rules when it wants.

"My university course on theology is making me start to question the Catholic Chuch Brief background: I am a freshman in college, and I’ve been raised Catholic my entire life. The university I go to is an affiliated Franciscan University. I’ve never questioned my faith before, just because it’s what I grew up believing.

When I was younger, sure I had catechism classes and stuff, teaching me about the Catholic faith and the Bible and all of that, but it was never really in depth enough for me. It was really just cherry-picking what my teachers wanted us to learn, or at least that’s how the curriculum was set up. 

Fast forward to this just past September; I’m required to take a class on Saints Francis and Clare, but the course I’m in has really gone more in depth into what Christianity and the affiliated beliefs are. 

In the course, we have three reading a week on which we are to reflect and pose different questions to prompt in class discussions. Through all of the readings we’ve had so far, I’ve actually come to start doubting, or questioning in a sense, everything that I’ve been taught up to this point. 

A recent insight I had about one of our readings was how Christianity is built largely on faith alone. Upon reflection, I came to realize that many of the cornerstones of Catholicism are built in that aspect of true faith. 

I guess I just never really took the time to truly read the Bible and try to truly understand it. Now that I’ve started doing that and looking back on the origins of Christianity and it’s evolution through time, it’s made me start to question some things that I’ve always believed in.",atheism,t3_dhuuco
"Why unbelief is not rebellion Suppose I come up to you and say every human on planet earth is in danger of being electrocuted by aliens, and they have the technology to make you live forever and make you get zapped over and over again for all eternity.  And suppose I give you a manual on how to avoid this.  Are you rebellious for throwing it away?  Or do you just have no reason to believe what I said?

See, the Bible (or the Quran or whatever) doesn’t give us enough reasoning to make it a credible source.  If we’re all wrong and God throws us in Hades, it won’t be out of rebellion for his word, it would be because he did not give us enough information to know what all the best moral choices are.

God is said to be all good, all powerful, and all knowing.  This means he should be able to tell us why it was all moral to say “women must be silent in church”, and to allow the Nazi regime and the Holocaust and every natural disaster.  God, if he knows all, should be able to pull a trump card (please no Trump jokes) as to why it’s all for the best, as nobody on earth knows everything.

But he doesn’t come down to earth and say why he let the Holocaust happen with no intervention, or why his word says women shouldn’t talk in churches.  He pulls no trump cards, if he even exists.

"Blindsided When Meeting with a ""Professional."" I'm going to start by saying this was a while back when I was finishing my degree. 

I went to a seminar from some local designer. He did logos for major networks and was offering to give advice to us entering the field. Our instructors always encouraged portfolio reviews, so I decided to meet with him to go over my portfolio. 

We met and he glanced over my portfolio briefly, before putting it to the side and asked me what my involvement was in church. I really didn't have words for it, so I told him I was busy with school.

Then he completely wrote me off and told me I should get involved in church, because that's the only way I'd be able to connect with people for a job. As a young person, it blindsided me. 

Through some luck, I happened to obtain jobs where a majority of my peers are Athiests or at least non-religious. I haven't had to be too careful about withholding my views (although there are some I still need to in order to keep a professional relationship). I was hired through a legitimate interview process, but I've seen other departments and careers where the manager will hire within their church. Which can't be legal, but it happens anyway.

"Help and Support for Teen atheist coming out to Christian parents So I know this subreddit gets memed on pretty hard but honestly this is probably one the only places I know of to ask for help. I just made a reddit account for this really even tho I lurk on Reddit sometimes. So that is to say if y’all have any Reddit tips for me that’d also be appreciated. 

Anyways the title pretty much says it all. I live in a Creationist Fundamentalist Christian household in a region with very few atheists or at least ones that I would be able to talk to. I became an atheist a few months ago and recently I’ve been struggling a lot with whether or not to tell my parents about my atheism. I know a lot of prominent atheists say basically not to until you’re independent but I’ve just been having so much trouble with it. It’s not just the blatant dishonesty to my family (except for my uncle who does know because he’s basically an atheist himself), but it’s more just the going to church twice a week, leading people in prayer, and the everyday stupid stuff I have to pretend to believe or do. The worst thing for me is seeing my little brother be indoctrinated before my eyes and having almost no way to do anything about it other than teach him critical thinking skills. Although I do think it is probably best for me to keep pretending to be a Christian to my family I just want your guys opinion and support. I will answer pretty much any question about my situation as long as it’s helpful to your advice and answers. Also I would like some advice on how to separate myself as quickly as possible from religion  after becoming an adult. Thanks for all those who respond!",atheism,t3_di0e74
"Why remove tax exempt status for religious groups? I'm not religious and really not a fan of religious groups. I would strongly feel that any group that is tax exempt should lose that status for trying to influence law, government, constitution etc, or just generally trying to push/force religion onto people. Or for committing crimes/covering up crimes (cough Catholic church).

But people who are very religious will believe that their religious group is a community thing in public interest. So obviously they will believe it should be tax exempt as a charity. I've seen a number of claims that religion should not be a valid criteria for tax exempt status. Why?

Obviously there should be measures to prevent cults and people who use religion to steal money (eg televangelists). I think for starters all religious groups (and realistically all charities) should have to publish full in depth accounts showing all their finances so people can see their bullshit.

There's also the issue of taxation with representation. If religious groups are taxed, then they'll claim they're entitled to have a say in government, but religion in government is forcing all people into that religion

"Why the Resurrection narrative makes no sense and how it got explained to me during my Sophomore year of high school When we were ""learning"" about why the resurrection was ordered the way they were, the discrepancies were explained away as the authors pointing their gospels to different audiences. This makes absolutely no sense once you put thought into it because if they really did want to spread the word to so many people, then why did the dates and people end up so different? Yeah, some changes are allowable due to oral telling, but changing entire people and timelines is too far. Also, John's gospel isn't even close to everyone else's. Due to seeing this, hearing some guardian angel shit, and applying critical thinking to that class, I ended up deconverting in the April of that year.",atheism,t3_dhrkv3

"Therapist is religious and I’m nervous to go I’m going for stress and anxiety. This woman has served in a mission and a bunch of church stuff.. She’s licensed so I’m not concerned, but I am concerned about how I need to approach religion. She’s Christian, I’m atheist, and my family doesn’t know. I am going to opt for the “non-Christian” session even though the therapy is in a Christian organization. There are no other options nearby so I’ll take what I get. The reason I’m nervous is because I’m meeting her tomorrow. I think she’ll be nice, and her beliefs don’t bother me. However, I’m queer, and I’m worried how she’ll handle that, or what she’ll tell me. 

Church and my family’s religion give me some stress and anxiety. It’s enough where I don’t want to go to any events they host there, or I dread Sunday, or I don’t socialize with people there much (if at all) because I can’t trust them. I am told that being LGBT is a sin and that I will go to hell (I’m not out to anyone in the church). They think you can be fixed by prayer and faith and all that shit. My family supports this, but believes I made a choice to be that way. I have even been called a demon by my mother because of the hatred I have for their bigotry. I have even been told by my dad that I should be happy he didn’t kick me out like people in the south do because “You shove this bullshit down all of our throats” when I barely mention it at all. 

I hope she’s actually positive as I am not too quick to open up to people and I don’t want to be in an echo chamber of what my family wants me to believe.

"Radical Christian group at my uni There was this radical Christian group at my uni last week and they were occupying the very centre of the main plaza. They were legit just preaching nonsense (examples: “if you’re a girl wearing short shorts you’re wicked and you’re only wearing them to attract Male attention” “homosexuals are killing each other and their intestines fall out once they engage in sexual relations”) and they had a whole “Jesus” exhibit in which they basically just had a bunch of bible verses about Jesus and why he had to die. They also had a microphone in front of their main panel, and they said anybody could ask a question. I asked them about omniscience and design and how that could work with the notion of free will, and gave an analogy something along the lines of “If I design a boat that’s full of holes in the bottom of it, and I give that boat to a captain, is the captain free to sink or float?” They didn’t really answer me and just brushed aside my analogy, despite being a rather simple yes or no question.  I pointed out that none of what they said was germane to the question. They then told me I was going to hell, and then kicked me off the mic. I talked to a few members afterwards and got them to agree to some ridiculous things. Here’s a few that are appalling, “if the it was the Christian god who commanded 9/11 there wouldn’t be anything intrinsically wrong with it.” “Rape is basically just pre-marital sex” “you have to use doublethink to be a Christian” “a serial killer who has raped and murdered children their whole life can simply repent and go to heaven but children born in North Korea with no knowledge of Christianity will be physically thrown by god into Hell” “all writing is anecdotal” “humans would fall into chaos without god but have intrinsic morals. (doublethink again)” “I have given up my ability to think about certain things because I am Christian”. Anyways thought this sub would find it interesting to hear how insane some of the thoughts are among radical Christians.",atheism,t3_dhup9s
"Personal relationship with God There’s a phrase I’ve heard quite a bit living around Christians. That phrase is “personal relationship with Jesus Christ/God” it’s usually been used in church, but it has been mentioned outside of church as well. It’s usually these same people that command children being brought into the church. Even if the kids don’t want to go, they are expected to. They’re expected to have this relationship with God that they don’t really care about. 

At this point it ceases to be a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It’s a forced relationship that is the very same as the one who pushed it. They’re expected to believe, to pray, and to think the same way. To do different would lead to chastising, and re-education. They wind up following this belief based of fear and pressure. It carries on into their adulthood whether they believe anymore or not. 

Forcing children into an environment they don’t fully understand or don’t want to be in out of fear does far more damage to them than keeping them home and unaware of the beliefs of a dying religion.",atheism,t3_dhxhc5

"I was harassed to tear a page of the bible just to prove I was an atheist by a group of catholics. This is fucking disgusting behavior. I can’t believe this behavior came out of my friends. I was born in the Philippines, a catholic country, so atheism is taboo in here. I am studying in this catholic school(no choice because mom doesn’t know). So anyway my friends are all christians and they asked me “ If you’re truly an atheist go rip out your bible.” I said that I was atheist not anti-christ. They dont care. They are so fucking blinded by their ego and religion. I was pissed and tired at the time and I just wanted that to end. But I have respect for their own sacred text so I just decided to fake tear my own book. And they fucking went bananas. These bastards throwed salt at me and called me “the devil”, “impakto” or monster and many more blasphemous things that would cost about a 100 hail marys. Even though at my state(pissed) I stayed acting like it was a joke . And when I asked that motherfucker why did they asked me to do that he said “I just wanted to see if you have sympathy for the bible.” I’m shaking angry. I want to go full-on ass kicking mode but can’t because unlike them I have moral standards. “Ofcourse I have sympathy for the book, that’s my stuff not yours. And with all this that you’re doing, I’m actually a better catholic than all of you.” I shouted. It’s so fucking hypocritical that I hate it.

"Would you send your child to a church based preschool as an atheist? My husband has recently left the Catholic Church and told me he is an atheist.  I grew up secular, although not atheist, but this change doesn’t bother me.  

However, I’m looking at local part time preschools and the cheapest ones are church based.  I’m tempted to tour a few and see how much Jesus is in it.  My husband only reluctantly came around to the idea because the price difference is pretty big between many of the big chain preschools and a church based one.  Also, it seems like most of my mom group send their kids to a church based program so that’s what most recommended to me.  

My BIL is also areligious and he and SIL decided to do a church based program because it was cheap and “not crazy fundie”.  It seems like a good trade-off (a few songs about Jesus but mostly fun and they save money).  But hubby and I worry about confusing our child with what she learns in preschool and what she hears at home.

"My Father basically told me today that we would never be very close because I am not a Christian I know many other people have been cut off from their family entirely or even killed for renouncing their families religion so my experience tonight I'm sure is extremely common in comparison but I still feel hurt from it.


Tonight at my grandparents rented cottage my Father and I were debating Trump's possible impeachment and he started talking about how it's been a witch Hunt this whole time and they didn't have much of an investigation at all into Hillary but spent two years on Trump and now it's on to the next thing. He said the CIA and the FBI have been after him. I said ""that's the Deep State conspiracy and there's no evidence for it"" he became angry and stayed up in his room while everyone else played cards. (Not unusual for him)

Finally when my dad came down and was packing their van to leave I went to him and told him I love him and I did not mean to insult him or anything and I was looking for an explanation for why he got so upset.

(Obviously there was a huge emotional conversation that Im mostly leaving out but I'm keeping the main part)

He said ""every time you disagree with me on something I always think about how you do not believe in God and it breaks my heart, im not angry with you and it's not personal but there's a reason your mom is not close with her parents"" [they are atheists as well]

He then said ""it always reminds me of what Christ said, 'i come not to bring peace but war to turn brother against brother, father against son' and this is what he meant. I will not be able to help you or give you advice. You threw everything I taught you away"" 

I tried to tell him he taught me loyalty and morality and to love justice, and family, but insisted 

""But you threw out everything I am, everything your mom and I are. We believe you are going to hell, and my heart also aches for your son as you raise him. My two biggest heartbreaks are you and your sister"" [she has an auto immune disease]

Somewhere in the conversation I mentioned how I felt like Christianity propelled itself through history using the fear of hell and social pressure. I told them it seemed much more likely to be human made manipulation. 

And when he looped back around saying all this I just again became amazed again at how fervently people believe all this. It is exactly this behavior that perpetuates the belief. It's so dangerous. It takes guts to speak up and question what you've been taught in the face of that much social pressure. When your father basically tells you you can't be close emotionally because I'm not a part of his cult.

"Personal thread about conflicts with Adventism Hey, my name is Morgan, I'm a minor (not going to specify my age) that turned to Atheism this year for my own reasons and because I stopped having faith. I used to be an Adventist, and let me tell you, it's more horrible now that I realize it.

First of all, the main reason I stopped following Adventists was because of their close-minded ideas. The whole ""you can only find true happiness in Jesus"" and many others just slowly sickened me and threw me away from it. I've been conducting my own research regarding the existence of God, and I took the decision of stopping believing. Needless to say, my parents didn't support it.

My parents are the classic ""you can't just not believe in something"" types of parents, except my dad is Catholic. My mom, however, is much more critical about it. She has tried various times to try to make me return to church, and she's been doing this through mostly wrong means. I constantly feel like I'm being forced when she keeps stating that she doesn't want to force me but *then* remarks that she can totally do that if she wished to. I've been using a computer since I was 5, been joining communities since I was as young as 9, and my mom sees this as a **mistake.** She has that ""the internet is evil"" mentality that doesn't support me having friends on Discord when those same friends have helped me through very rough times and are pretty much the best friends I ever got in my life. Plus, my town is also very close-minded and the people around my age are generally very disrespectful and lewd (thanks, puberty).

Notably, she's been guilt-tripping me with the whole ""I don't want you to go to hell while I'll go to heaven"" and ""you're going to turn into a bad person"" arguments and she believes in stuff like the National Sunday Law, while it's clear that such thing would never be possible.

The reasons why I don't want to fight my mom are because:

1. She's my mom.
2. Apparently I'm ""too young to decide"" and I was ""tricked by the Devil""
3. I'm more than certain that she's not going to take my research.
4. The church people are definitively going to intervene.
5. I fear she might do something bad, like ban me from the internet for as long as I live with them or force me to go back.

"SIL always asking how she can pray for me, today she asked for my favorite bible verse. How do I respond without being rude? My sister-in-law is very sweet and would do anything for anyone. She is also very religious and (I think?) just assumes everyone is of the Christian faith, as that is all she has ever known. She often texts me to ask things like how she can pray for me, and I usually just respond by saying something like ""life is pretty good actually, but thank you for thinking of me."" Maybe that is too subtle, and she is not really known for picking up on those types of nuances anyway. Today she texted to ask what my favorite verse of the bible is. How can I respond to this? I don't want to come across as rude, but I can't figure out a good response. I'm not a ""militant atheist"" by any means but I was under the impression my family was aware of my thoughts on religion. Maybe not. Anyway, I am exceptionally tired and don't feel like my brain is firing on all cylinders today, which I'm sure isn't helping matters. Any and all advice is welcome and appreciated.

EDIT: Thank you all for taking the time to respond.  I just told her that my favorite part of the bible is when god give everyone free will and then drowns them all for not acting the way he wanted.

For backstory, my ex was very religious. She thoroughly enjoyed church and her beliefs so I didn't bother arguing with her and just respected her beliefs as ridiculous as they were.

"First time back in a church in many years I knew that I would end up going back at some point and this time was because my grandmother had passed away due to old age and she was a religious person. I did the adult thing and went along with her wishes. 

When I sat in the ceremony listening to the words I remember so clearly why I’m an atheist. The entire time exclaiming that we shall give ourselves  to “god” and the entire ceremony was just a different collection of passages that said if you give your self “god” he will allow you into heaven. Then the whole room would repeat as if they were brainwashed and then it hit me, they are. 

The brainwashing was so evident, if you repeat after me you will also be loved by “god”. I acted professionally and was apart of it for a member of my family that I cared about but I hope it’s a long time before I have to be inside of a church again.

"religion in romania. We had french class recently and the teacher was kind of busy so she let us do what we wanted.

Long story short, I ended up talking about why I'm an atheist for about 40 minutes. It was quite an experience (because the teacher isn't really a believer either) but damn Romanians are so close minded. They kept asking me the stupidest questions ever, like:

""You must pray to something! At least to the sun!"" - no Karen, I don't pray to anything.

""Well if you don't believe in God, do you at least believe in Satan? - Obviously not.

""If you have a nightmare or you think of something bad you saw in a movie, what do you do? I always pray when that happens to me"" - Well, I know what is real and what is not.

Yes, this is better than being an outright asshole, but it's still fucking pretentious and rubs me the wrong way. **""Not agreeing"" with someone's choices is the same thing as judging someone**, lets not pretend we're on the same page. And I'm willing to bet they would vote against your freedom to make those choices when it comes down to it.

**I'm all for your freedom to judge me and indoctrinate your children**, but I'm going to judge you as a misguided dumbass in return, just like you are judging me as a sinner. So religious people, if you ""don't agree"" with something I do, you're against it and I'm most likely not going to vibe with you. You ""don't agree""  with me and I ""don't agree"" with you.

"One of my oldest memories is me getting aroused by a children's illustrated bible. I'm a gay dude, I haven't actually come out to many people yet but I just feel like I need to tell someone this.

My nursery was one of those adjacent-to-the-church-but-not-religious-except-all-the-people-there-are-christian kind of places, and I remember enjoying my time there. When leaving, we were given a proper heavy present, so I was a little disappointed upon opening it to find that it was a children's bible.

Anyway, must have been like 7 and I remember looking through the bible and seeing a drawing of a scantily-clad Jesus after 40 days in the desert or whatever and as a child i remember REALLY liking to look at this image. 

One day I think my dad saw me looking at it while getting ready for bed and must have noticed my excitement because I could never find the image again, and only years later I began to suspect he ripped the page out.

I just think it's ironic that a group sometimes opposed to homosexuality gave me on of my earliest memories that made me realize I was gay. 

But made me think further - imagine a child growing up in a deeply religious family, very minimal sexual experiences, but are still exposed to a statue of a ripped dude on a cross... Could it effect their sexual development? 

Anyway, that was my silly story and a little theory.",atheism,t3_dhi9a0
"How I became Athiest. I know that this subreddit is probably for epic Athiest memes and stuff like “Athiest DESTROYS Catholic Preist!!111!” But this is more of a serious thing I wanted to get out here to make other atheists feel not alone, that there are others that have backed away from religion and have faced harsh, unfair judgement for confessing about the true selves.

   I had begun my doubts about Christianity when I was 11. I was in a very strict Catholic School where they punished fellow classmates for “Saying the lord’s name in vain” and shit like that. Things that they did their like paddling a kid because he said he slit his wrists and showed people his scars made me sick. He said he was done with his life. And what did the corporation do? They thought things like suicidal tendencies gave the school a bad record and were somehow sinful. I hated it there. My father didn’t ever stop talking about religion and faith. Every conversation was “God this and God That” and I was sick and fucking tired of his shit. I saw him beating the everloving shit out of my mother every 3-4 days because my mother was Protestant. I wanted to kill myself and every day felt like a year. Boredom overcame me as I was filled with this stupid catholic propaganda at school and at home. I couldn’t stand watching my parents fight and threatened to kill myself in front of my parents with the reaction being my dad punching me in the stomach saying “Suicide is a Mortal Sin” and that it’s like killing someone else.

I wasn’t allowed to leave since that incident, he was afraid I’d call the police or leave the house for good. I cried every day for hours. Hearing my parents fight while my life was consumed in darkness trying to mute all bad things. I can vaguely remember my dad grabbing a fucking knife and almost chopping off my moms finger because she threatened to leave.

My mother had always said we where going to leave and I didn’t know why it took so long to. When I was 13 I had left with my mom to a shelter where they had internet and I was able to get my first iPhone. This is where I had indulged into the atheists community of YouTube and music. I started going to public school. When I was 14 I began coming out as athiest, telling my friends.

I soon became an outcast. No one hung out with me and I swear the teachers had given me horrible grades because of what they heard. Mind you I lived in kentucky, a very religious state. I was jumped when I was in the bathroom or alone in the hallway almost on a weekly basis. And my depression overwhelmed me once again.

I tried killing myself by sneaking some NyQuil from the shelters food pantry which is ironic, indeed, and for some reason no one was looking after. I tried to overdose on it but just woke up in the hospital 3 days later. I was put on suicide watch for 48 Hours when some man from child protective services came in my room. I told him everything about my dad and the catholic shit, and when I was done, he patted me on the shoulder and said “I’m sorry.” That was the first time someone could relate to me and I felt different, felt not alone. A year ago (I was 15) I moved into an actual house and went to a new school. Things got better for me as I made some friends that I could relate to with my edgy humor and atheism which was something that never happened to me, I had never really had friends that I cared about until now, which is cool.

Anyways That’s everything. Sorry I’m not a very good writer this was just something I wrote about to make myself feel better.",atheism,t3_dhlj7j

"Why/how I fully left religion Quick warning I never truly had a connection with whoever or whatever is supposedly out there.

Alright, so I always knew I should leave religion and live the one life I know truly I will have for sure freely without being bound to a book that isn't needed, but I was raised in an all Christian household and was forced (And still am) to waste my Sunday being called out for being a 'slut' (The church's EXACT words) for not wanting to wear dresses.

So the minute I could find a way out, I'd take it.

Anyways, I actually left religion to the movie IT.  More over, the song 'Dear God' that played about halfway through, and that was only half of it, so eventually I decided to look for the song, and I listened to it fully, and the song perfectly described how I felt about religion.   After every time I had to go into that church, I'd probably listen to it outside because it comforted me to know in a very religious society (I live in a place where almost everyone goes to church and those who don't aren't treated with respect) that I wasn't alone in believing that nobody was out there.

So, the way my idiotic ass brought this up to mom was when we cleaned the church (Nobody else but me and her) I ended up connecting my phone to the speakers to play that song.  And I haven't heard louder screaming coming from her since, and I was banned from watching horror movies for a while(She's dead now.  RIP you were a piece of bullshit but still) and I have brought it up to my dad (My dad isn't very religious himself, he just takes me and him to church to avoid being disliked in the place we live in, and we are thankfully moving soon)    I sent the song to my dad and he agreed that's how he felt too.

So, yeah, that's how a 2017 horror film showed me a way out of religion.  If the whole song was put into the movie I probably wouldn't have looked it up and would still be religious.

But, leaving religion was the best thing I ever did, and soon, I won't ever have to go into another church again.

"Experiences with anti-atheist Christians My best friend since grade school dated a girl a few years back (they’ve since broken up) who decisively despised me for not believing in God. I am a lesbian, and she once commented that she didn’t care if she was being “sinful” for thinking gay people were ok. I asked her why she thought that would be some kind of sin, and she responded with some confused rant about how the Bible “doesn’t like gay people” but she does or some shit. Nevertheless, I respectfully questioned her bullshit when it came up, as I have lived in a family with two theist parents, who have taught me about why they believe in God and fully support my decision to not believe in deities, because I respect their decision go believe. So through the time my friend and her dated, we were never on great terms, but I certainly didn’t hate her. We’d debate over religion, and I’d try to respect her beliefs and she’d sometimes get defensive. It eventually came through that her parents were the real crazies, and they pretty much forced her to break up with my friend because he believed in evolution. A year after their crazy-ass breakup, she tells me that we can’t be friends anymore. I’d never considered her to be my friend, but I wasn’t about to say that to her face. She told me she “never really got past that atheist thing.” And that’s when it dawned on me that she might have been about as crazy as her parents.

He really really like Anthony Bourdain and later I became a fan too. 

When the news of Bourdain's suicide came out, he was devastated, our life is stressful and losing someone we like, even it's a celebrity, made us very sad.

One day he asked, do you think he will go to hell because he killed himself? 

At that time I was still kinda a believer, but I can't accept this idea.

I said no way, he won't, God won't judge people base on that. I also said, because he killed himself because of depressed, so it's like depression killed him, not suicide. 

I was really trying to convince myself. Some of my favorite actors killed themselves too, I didn't want to believe they were in hell. 

It's ironic. When I threw myself in prayers in high school, I prayed everyday hoping people would stip bullying me, I chose religion and the fear for hell so I wouldn't kill myself, everyday I wanted to die. Of course, bully never stop, pray for your enemy didn't work.

You know why? Because we’re all gonna die someday. Why can’t we just be happy for being alive and make others happy for being alive as well. This is your story, my story, all of our stories! No one wants to read a story where someone grows old sad or dies young by their own hands.

"Pet peeve: unsolicited religious advice from strangers. Yesterday my husband and I attended a funeral for his great aunt. The funeral was held in a church, and the church members fed all of the family before the services. There were a ton of people there I’d never met before. 

While we were eating, my husband begins telling one of his cousins about some trouble we’re having with our seven year old in school right now. (He’s showing signs of ADD, severe enough to effect his grades and cause visits to the principal, but there’s a 3 month waiting list to get into the only child psychologist in our town to have him tested and treated, so we’re just having to try to push through the best we can for now.) There’s two people I’ve never met sitting between my husband and I and his cousin is sitting across from me. I begin to tell Kim, the cousin, that I don’t know what else to do. The school calls me and texts me every time he has a bad day, and I consistently tell them I will support whatever punishment they see fit, but THEY have to punish him when he does something wrong immediately. Telling me about it and asking me to handle it when he gets home four hours laters is not the answer. A child with a short attention span has already forgot why he did what he did wrong by that time.

Random old woman I’ve never met to my right starts in with her crap. “You can pray about it.” I give her a side eye and frozen smile. “Ok, thanks.” She continues, “And scripture. Having a child memorize scripture gives them a shield against the bad things in the world.” Still trying to be polite, but get the point across that I don’t want to hear her crap, “Uh, huh,” turns head away, “anyway Kim, like I was saying...” She grabs my arm and interrupts, “And when you read scripture as a family, your relationship with God becomes so much stronger. I think it would really help your child with his problems.” At this point, I’m irritated. “My child has ADD. He needs professional help to teach him how to control the symptoms because his brain works differently than ours does. I’m working on getting that done.” She’s not giving up, “Well, a strong relationship with our lord will certainly help him on that path. Do you have a good church family? It would be truly terrifying to raise a child in this world with the way things are today. So many have turned away from God.” I’m grinding my teeth at this point because she’s just not getting the point that I don’t want to listen to this crap. I say, “I’m an atheist, and I believe raising a child in any era was difficult. Parenting is hard. And prayer will do nothing to help with that.” And with that, I gave my husband and his cousin a look, like ‘thanks for helping, y’all,’ then I got from the table, and walked away. This was not the place for that type of conversation, and I just knew if I didn’t remove myself this old woman was going to continue to press the issue and I was not about to cause a scene at a funeral.

I cannot understand these people. Not everyone shares your beliefs. Do not eavesdrop on a stranger’s conversation and proceed to inject your religious crap into their conversation. I did not ask for her opinion or advice. I tried politely as possible to get the point across to her that I wasn’t interested in her advice and still she kept on.

My friend was very determined with the fact that spirits are in shows, movies or whatever and when you watch or listen to them, you're allowing demons into your home and yourself??? I had no response to what she said because what could I say?? Then she went on to say there's subliminal waves in them and that's what allows demons to take control of you or whatever.. 


There was so much more said.. she said bloody Cinderella was witchcraft and even that allows demons or spirits to take over you. Cinderella? A Disney movie? Are you kidding me? 


Then she went on to say she watched a music video with a girl that was essentially naked and she went back to watch it again. She wondered why she went back to it and said it was because of the subliminal waves in the musical video. Then she said she FELT something coming into her when she watched the video (a spirit or demon or something).


She started to avoid girls and I told her that it was normal, that she was probably confused with her sexuality but she said it was the devil tempting her or something possessing her and it's normalized by society because of Satan..  So she turned to Jesus and prayed the gay away..


I HAD NO WORDS I JUST HAD TO LOOK AT HER LIKE.. 


Then she went on to say that mental illnesses are caused by demons and I did not finish that conversation because I had to go home and I'd be there all day.

"My wife is being dragged in... I've been together with my wife for 10 years. She's from SE Asia, and when I met her I knew she was Christian. She was never serious about it... never saw or heard her pray, never went to church, never tried to convince me of anything.  
But the past year, she's turning into something else... she's listening to all kinds of (mostly) American lunatics talk about faith, end times, Jéééésus and more nonsense. For the first time in our relationship she's been trying to convince me that I need God.  
I asked her if she has read the bible. (I have, and I've never been religious) She says she's too lazy for that, but she lets people who 'studied' the bible tell her the stories on Facebook and Youtube. I offered her to read the bible together, all of it, so she understands her own religion. She says it's not going to be productive because I'm only going to look at the negative sides of it.  
I'm losing my wife to this bullshit. She's brainwashing herself more and more... it's horrifying. I love her, so much... but I can't handle this.

"The Way I Saw the Light. Or the story on how I became more of a free thinker. Background: I have Cerebral Palsy, and this dates back to when I was five or so, so... apologies if this gets a little hazy. So sit back and relax, this is gonna be a long one.  


So it all started when I was five. Being the youngest in a now mixed family with my Dad and my Stepmother marrying, I didn't know that I was gonna be thrown straight into religion. As mentioned above, I have CP, and I have worn braces ever since I was three. I'm seventeen now.   


The first lie that I was told was that 'Sky Daddy' could heal everything. Cancer? Healed. Heart disease? Healed. Wheelchair? Chuck that bitch into a river, you can walk! Being the wide-eyed little guy I was, I wanted to believe more than anything that I could be healed. That I could be like my big stepbrother, on the football team and tackling other players. So I prayed and prayed and prayed. Nothing. Not a single improvement. That was first in a long line of lies.  


The second lie, this was when I started getting a healthy dose of history class, coupled with my fascination with history in general, I remember that I was eight when I had this real serious thought. Hearing about the wars, the Holocaust, and the general malcontentedness in the world, I began to wonder...  


Where was 'Sky Daddy' in all of this? Where was he when people were praying to him? Where was he when people were begging him for their lives? Doing nothing up in 'Heaven'. I started to crack, that crack became a gaping hole that same year when I got my Achilles Tendon surgery.  


Now, I appreciate all the physical therapists, and my Podiatrist, for assisting me with getting to where I am now. If any of you come across this, thank you from the very bottom of my heart. Anyway! So with that, I started to doubt more and more, think more and more.

'Sky Daddy' didn't send these people, they're doing their job and are generally good people. Without them,  I'd be in a wheelchair and a worse position. This wasn't divine intervention.

This was even more compounded by the sheer amount of different churches I've been to. I've been to a Lutheran, Baptist, Presbyterian, and even an Evangelical church. All with their own opinions and views. I've had a metric shit-ton of friends be from these churches end up being either Atheists, Agnostics, or just not caring. 

Then came the event that changed everything, the sheer magnitude nine earthquake that shattered the doubt and told me, 'Yeah, this is BULLSHIT!' 

Now, I didn't mind if people prayed over me, go ahead and get that gold star from 'Sky Daddy'! But it reached a point where I was fed up, where I was pissed off being treated like some 'Free Salvation from an eternal torture zone' child. I started to just... think.

I started to go back and think, why DID I get baptized? Oh, because my sisters, brother, Dad, and Stepmother did. Why did I gain an inferiority complex? Oh, because I saw myself as less than everyone else because I did what I love. Why did I think I was a sinner? Because the Bible told us we were.

I started to feel lost, and alone. If I was a sinner, then why did doing what I love, writing, playing video games, watching TV shows, hanging out with friends, matter? If 'Sky Daddy' was so powerful, why didn't he just stop every war in history? 

Then I realized, right then and there, one fateful night just laying in bed. It was all a lie. There was no 'Sky Daddy', if there was, he'd hit the reset button on us twenty-billion times over. If he loved us so much, then why did he just sit back and watch as we died and burned and choked and ate high-velocity shells of lead for causes that shouldn't matter?

I realized that God is the single greatest lie anyone has ever told. My only wish, if I ever have a family, is to tell my children: ""It's okay to believe in anything you want, it's your life. Don't believe in what I believe, but in what you want to believe,""

I... I feel so lost. I'm pretty much the only atheist in my family. I'm thinking of a way to tell my family that I'm one, or just wait until I'm out and forging my own life? I'm scared and I wish I had someone to tell me that I'm going down a good path. I'm at war with my mind and my heart.

My heart says to fake my belief in God.

My mind says break away. I know my family will still love me, but... some of them may not. I want to make it a good term kind of break.

"Frustration with being told my beliefs are ""Sad"" I was a Mormon for 26 of my 28 years, and I was all in.  Promised a kingdom of infinite glory where I'd be a God of my own universe.  It sounds too good to be true, and although it is, it was what I *fully* believed.  

After my faith crumbled, I struggled with one existential crisis after another.  I felt lost, disconnected, and hopeless.  My marriage suffered, my relationship with my kids became hollow, and nothing mattered.

Then, slowly and surely, what was the bane of my existence, the phrase ""nothing matters"", became my mantra.

When I talk to my family and they ask ""what do you believe?"" or ""do you still believe in God, or in heaven and hell?"" my response has yet to be well received.

I'd say, ""There could be a God, but I don't think so.  I don't think there's life after death, and although I could be wrong, I choose to live with the expectation that this is our only life.  I find peace and satisfaction in these answers""

I get shrugs, or ""too bad"", or ""I'm sad for you"", or ""I invite you to continue praying, and one day you'll understand.""

In all honesty:

There could easily be a God, and just as easily not be.  But for all I know, and could ever claim know, I'm carried along by a universe that does not give a single fuck.  It can't.  It's not conscious. And even if it were, the earth is the backside of a barnacle on the back end of a freighter in an ocean of indifference - we would never have even been an afterthought in the billions and billions (cue Carl Sagan impression) of planets out there.

Me, right now, who I am, and what species I'm a part of was never supposed to exist.  And even further: technology, infrastructure, and the setting in which I enjoy my days was entirely accidental.  I could have been born in 504 B.C. and been a lowly peasant, or be born 75000 years ago and considered not being killed by Neanderthals a good day.  Or worse, I could have been a fruitfly and been here and gone in less than a day.

I could have been a miscarriage, died in child birth, killed by small pox 100 years ago, hit by that car yesterday, or died in my sleep, **or never have existed at all**.

**But here I am.**

Because there is no divine plan, no target or destination, my failures and succeses will be my own and disappear to me when I die.  Since I was never meant to be, any contribution will be infinitely more valuable than if I were fulfilling a prescribed path that was laid out before my birth.

Although this belief instills courage and hope in me now, at the beginning it almost pushed me to suicide.  After I transitioned to atheism, I would drive home from work and think to myself ""this would be so much less trouble if I just drove off the road into a brick wall.  Death seems so much less maintenance"".  I'm fortunate in that, rather than bring premature death, it brought a delayed but gratifying new lease on life.  

""Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die"" was a phrase I was taught would be said by the lazy, sinful, deniers of truth - and the crushing rality was that there would be no phrase that would bring me so much joy and purpose.

I translate it to:

""Do good.  Make decisions that bring joy to you and those around you. Be the change you want to see in the world.  Don't wait to love, live, or belong until it's too late.  One day you will die, but you won't even be there to feel it, or miss any of this. 

So love your wife all the more, take that extra time to be with your kids, and be that friend, neighbor, and stranger that makes the difference in the lives of others.  Work less, and live more.""

I would love to live with my family forever, have that eternal glory, and a God who hears and knows my heart.  I miss that belief more than I'd like to admit.  

But for now, I'll just focus on today.  And tomorrow will take care of itself.

"Somewhat of a Rant: Pressured into prayers in Church Of England schools. Just some quick info on CoE Schools in England:
- Protestant (Henry VIII, blah blah)
- Daily prayers, with an undermining theme towards them.
- Not all of them are the same, but they all have to follow basic guidelines.

Throughout my time in school, I've been blasted with a sense of Christianity throughout my Childhood; whether it is from the education system, or friends or members of groups I've attended telling me about the 'wonders of Christianity and Protestantism.' I live in a Protestant dominated area, and there are numorus local churches around me.

To the 'delight' of my schools, I have chosen not to continue with the religion and become an Athiest.

On some days, we had/will have a faith assembly, solely devoted to the teachings of God and what the Bible says about certain things. To be truthful, I try and stay informed about what the member of staff is saying, but I can't be arsed to. I don't what to follow a rule book, or a set of instructions for my life, I want a clear path, and that's what Athiesm means to me, regardless of what the school says about it. At the end of the assembly, we do usually 2 prayes: a prayer about the topic we were discussing, and the Lords prayer.

Each time it happens, most of the audience, excluding some students (including me) join in unison. However, due to my beliefs, I feel pressured into the comments I may recieve or have received before about my decisions. I do not want any stigma against not praying; I should be able to express myself fully as a true Athiest.

Btw, most of my family are either Agnostic or about to cross over.

"When Religion Gets Involved in an Atheists Funeral I knew somebody in high school who was an atheist but came from a religious family.  Her and her mother died in a car crash and the majority of the grade went to the funeral.  The funeral was very religious, as was to be expected because of the religious family she came from.  I had a very real sympathy for her family, who surely both didn't realize she was an atheist, and needed the support of the church through their grieving process.  On the other hand, it disturbed me that she had gone through the wonderful experience of realizing god isn't real, and then was being talked about as if she was happy to be with god now.  It made me realize how much funerals are more about the family and friends of the deceased, and not about them.  Has anybody experienced a similar situation where they felt like an atheists opinions were set aside in the face of a tragedy?

I always loved that scene in the movie Captain Fantastic when they dumped their moms ashes down the airport toilet.  Not only because of the anti-religious themes of it all, but also because they really knew what she wanted her death to be like and respected her wishes.

"Am I becoming an Islamaphobe or maybe I already am ?  

This is a generalisation I know and I am quite sure there is lots of ample anecdotal evidence to say otherwise, however I am trying to ask a serious question.

I live in the UK and I have always found that people of different nationalities and ethnicity, who settle in in the UK bring a great deal of vibrancy, colour and new ideas to the UK.

Recently though I have began to see a worrying trend, when people of Islam settle in aparticular area in the UK it appears that all the colour and vibrancy slowly ebbs away, shops shut, pubs close down. Even on the streets there is no colour, a few bright hijabs possibly but mostly black or very dark clothes for both male and female. The areas become dowdy, run down, almost no go areas. This especially the case in some northern towns and suburbs of certain cities, they become quite simply depressing. It maybe possible to argue these are deprived areas but this is not the case where other nationalities/ethnicities congregate.

Women of Islam once in mid twenties simply evaporate, they become invisible non persons, how many people can say they work with a Muslim woman over 35. If you are white caucasion you would not engage with them as you would with any other ethnic group. They are about though, almost always only with other hijab wearing women. Never ever with male caucasions unlike almost all other ethnic groups in the UK.

Bit of anecdotal stuff – I watched the Extinction Rebellion walk down Oxford Street, not one hijab to be seen in that crowd of thousands, I am sure there would be Muslims in there but I did not see one, yet they make up a substantial section of the UK community and should have been up there front and centre.

Hyde Park bandstand has music on Sunday afternoon, lots of people there, little children dancing, all nationalities, colours etc enjoying the music and engaging with each other – not one hijab, yet the park is rammed full of Mulsim families all in little group clusters all only engaging with fellow Mulsims.

To me this is a worrying trend, the UK has spent centuries getting rid of suffocating, mysogenistic religion and it is now making a comeback in a religion  that isolates itself from the wider community and is extremly inward looking.

I would welcome the people but I simply do not want their medieval, suffocating religion.

"Atheism and Recovery from Addiction... Since my original post last weekend I've garnered so much support from the atheist community that I would be remiss if I did not say thank you. So, thank you! 

This week my doctor told me that I need to start praying and doing more spiritual things if I want to stay in the program and on Suboxone. 

I've been doing everything they have asked of me so far. I see the doctor once a week, my therapist twice a week, and I go to IOP groups four days a week two hours per day. I also live in transitional housing that specializes in recovery. 

Lately though, the push towards having a ""spiritual awakening"" is becoming a little disconcerting. At this point it may seem like I'm nitpicking because I am actually doing well in the program, but I think that it should be said that the push for people to find religion and/or spirituality in order to recover needs to be addressed. 

The disease of addiction is ravaging our country (USA) and something needs to be done about it. These so called ""spiritual"" programs are not helping very many people. New research is showing that it takes a multi-faceted approach in order to keep people clean. The evidence for 12 step programs just isn't there. 

The options available for non-believers are almost non-existent. While research shows that groups can be helpful because of of the support network.

"Do you find that people get more upset over denying the ""afterlife"" more than denying ""God""? (First, let me say that I'm not an evangelist. I only discuss this stuff with friends and family if someone else brings it up first.)

Let's say a conversation involving belief/faith comes up. Has anyone else noticed that if you say anything about denying the existence of an ""afterlife"" that it gets people  even more upset than if you deny the existence of ""God""?  If so, why is this?

IMHO, to most people ""God"" is some conceptual authoritative entity that's at a distance.  But the ""afterlife"" is more personal... it's where we're going to meetup with our deceased loved ones in some eternal family/friend reunion.  It's also the place were ""justice"" is handed out to those who were ""good"" or ""bad"".

"I Can Finally Admit It: I always thought church was boring and heaven was going to be boring As far back as I can remember, I have been doubtful of everything god-related. I was raised Indie, Fundie Baptist. Went to Lutheran schools and a couple Baptist schools \~\~not at the same time, mind you\~\~ growing up.

I was taught that heaven was going to be this place where we worshiped god all the time. 

And church didn't really teach me anything other than what god doesn't like.  I thought that maybe, at least in Sunday School, the education of the bible would be more sophisticated. As a kid, Sunday School was only about what was considered sin.

I wanted to know the origins of the bible, how it was translated, the reasoning as to how the original constructors of the bible decided what was 'god inspired' texts, and so much more. 

Well, I learned that adult Sunday School was a continuation of kid Sunday School. I learned nothing about the history of bibles or early-ages controversies around it. I went to various churches trying to find the education I desired, to no avail.

I also remember hearing a song that is famous among the baptists. The first version I heard had a very nice, catchy melody song by Naomi &amp; the Sega Brothers. The song is called 'Hallelujah Square'. Though I still enjoy the catchy tune, the words have always been depressing: 'We'll sing and praise jesus all the day long'.

That's what we're going to do for eternity?!?!? Stand and sit around praising god/jesus?!?!  I've always wanted to learn how to fly a kite.    I would think with all eternity I would be able to be flying a kite with all the knowledgeable kite-flyers that will be in heaven.

What about bird-watching? Will there even be birds in heaven? I enjoy bird-watching. I want to watch the birds. But will their be binoculars available to be able to enjoy the birds?

I would want to ride a bicycle in heaven. Would I be able to do THAT?

Singing songs all day about the same thing ad nauseum always seemed so boring to me. AAMOF, if it had not been an either-or choice \~\~heaven or hell\~\~ I would have chose non-existence over being in heaven. Heaven didn't seem to pleasurable to me. It seemed like it would be one long, long, never-ending church service. Did I mention I found church services incredibly boring?

Now I'm glad to know that I don't have to go to heaven when I die. I will just cease to be. And with my skepticism comes the relief of finally being able to say that I don't WANT to go to church, and I don't WANT to go to heaven. Both are boring.

"AITA for telling my parents im not going to lie to my brother and help them indoctrinate him? So my family is a southern baptist family. I was indoctrinated into that church but about 6 years ago I decided that I couldn't be a Christian because I didn't see any evidence for god. I told my parents this and they have been surprisingly supportive besides a few ""you'll be back when you hit hard times"" type discussions. I live about an hour away from my parents' house and I visit from time to time. Today when my mother and I were alone, she asked that I not tell my brother, who is 7, what I believe when it comes to god if he asks me because she wants him to be saved just in case he turns away from religion when he grows older. I told her that if he asks me that I'm not going to lie to him because that would be wrong. She at first agreed for me to not lie to him but as we continued to talk she said if he asks me to tell him to come talk to her or my dad if he ever asks and I told her no that if he asks me what I believe I'm not lying for telling him that and that I disagree with them actively hiding information from him so that he will be indoctrinated. She told me she is disappointed that I'm not respecting her choice to raise her child and now my parents are pissed at me. AITA?",atheism,t3_dh3qm7

"Which would you choose? EDIT: The general consensus is dont stir the pot unless they stir it first. Which is my whole approach. I appreciate you guys and gals offering both your opinions and similar experiences. Im happy letting my kids believe in santa, and my family believe in a god of love. Until it causes problems. 

So I have finally given up the last vestiges of any belief. I was raised in the south, went to church regularly up until college then just... didn't. I have struggled with faith until recently, after having children. Something about becoming a parent helped bring the awfulness of the world into crystal clear focus and how religion has played a major role in all of it. In those moments, the struggle relaxed and any fear of embracing an existence that didn't involve fealty to an invisible sky wizard faded away. So... the dilemma.

My parents, and my brother are all good people. But they remain steadfast in their faith. When they talk about it I just nod my head, neither in agreement or disagreement, just waiting for the opportunity to change the subject. It doesn't take long. They aren't evangelicals or anything. 

So is this the better path, not hurting anyone by not engaging in any sort of ""...well ackshually"" kind of debate or do I just challenge them the next time they bring it up and explicitly tip my hand and show my cards? (and honestly no one has asked about my beliefs and I think if they do ask I will be honest and say I just don't feel it anymore). 

I'm not interested in making gatherings awkward and they don't preach anti-LGBTQ or hate of any kind so don't think I sit there grinding my teeth because of their backwoods notions.

"I feel stuck I'm a 22 year-old girl feeling trapped. 

My life is far from miserable from an outsider perspective: I land a decent job out of college and have no worries about money, live with my family who are loving and supportive, and have a few friends that I trust and care for. However, the loneliness and contradiction I feel is killing me slowly.

So, why do I say I'm trapped... because basically, my parents and my views are in great conflicts. 

I love my parents, and they are amazing people. We are really close, except... what I will mention very soon. I can't imagine a life where I grow distant from them, but I know for a fact that for me to live happily as my full, true self, I'll have to take a risk in damaging our relationships irreversible. 

They are hardcore Christians. Their lives are almost centered around church activities and people. I was baptized in high school because of my family influence, but to be honest, looking back at this rocky road called religion, I have never been a true believer. No matter how hard I tried, no matter how many Christians gatherings I've been to, the voice of doubt is always louder in my head. I have never truly feel the presence of God, but I fake the life of a Christian because of my parents. If I don't go to church, they get upset. How could I say to them that... I just don't believe it? In fact, I hope with all my heart that the God described in the Bible doesn't exist, because if so, that means this all loving God creates Hell for most of his children to spend eternity in. Marvelous plan, God.  

Their religion also makes it really, really hard to come out to them as homosexual/possibly bisexual. I can imagine what would be next. I'll totally crash my mom's heart, and she'll start praying every hour for God to lead me back to the ""right"" path. They've always want me to find a decent, Christian guy and get married, have their grandchildren, and happily ever after. How do I even tell them that first of all, I don't want Christian, and second, I don't want a guy? The life I want to live is greatly different from the image they have. 

I want to stop going to church, I want to be able to have a civil conversation telling them: I'm not a believer and has never been one and will never be one. I really am not a Christian and I go to church because of the people, because of my parents, not once was it because of God. And after all that, they wouldn't try their hardest to prove me wrong and trying to ""convert"" me to what they think is the truth of life. I want to be able to come out, seek LGBT peers, and meet my potential partner. 

I can't change my parents, but I just wish they can understand me... understand that this is not my choice to be rebellious or special... this is who I am. I can't force myself to be a Christian, nor can I force myself to love a Christian man. I really wish they can understand me, yet still accept me and love me the same as who I am. 

How do I approach this life situation...I'm just growing depressed. If someone's in the same boat, please, I need to talk to you.",atheism,t3_dh6t95

"Pedophilia arose from the Christian's??? So I was talking to my friend (muslim 28M) about how there was massive bust at a dungeon school in Nigeria, Africa, where kids were raped and abused and forced to learn/adhere to Muslim practices while kept in chains in a literal dungeon. And before that there was a big child raping case with Jehovah's Witnesses and obviously the whole catholic church stuff in the past few years. I said a lot of these religious officials are using religion to mostly rape kids and brainwash them. And that these incidents are alarmingly high in Christianity and Islam. My friend then replies to the Nigeria Muslim school situation by saying 'these Imams [muslim Reverend's pretty much] learned these child raping stuff from the Christian's. I wanted to say 2 things: 
1) that's what you got out of this news? Really?
2) you're telling me people from religions who can't stand each other picked up raping kids in an age where there is no internet and news was carried from city to city by a guy on a horse?
I'm no expert on child raping so I can't back this up, but I would hypothesize that both independently came upon it cause religion is like a light to a moth for pedophilia. What do y'all think?

"Minority Report  It is often argued that religion is valuable because it makes men good, but even if this were true it would not be a proof that religion is true. That would be an extension of pragmatism beyond endurance. Santa Claus makes children good in precisely the same way, and yet no one would argue seriously that the fact proves his existence. The defense of religion is full of such logical imbecilities. The theologians, taking one with another, are adept logicians, but every now and then they have to resort to sophistries so obvious that their whole case takes on an air of the ridiculous. Even the most logical religion starts out with patently false assumptions. It is often argued in support of this or that one that men are so devoted to it that they are willing to die for it. That, of course, is as silly as the Santa Claus proof. Other men are just as devoted to manifestly false religions, and just as willing to die for them. Every theologian spends a large part of his time and energy trying to prove that religions for which multitudes of honest men have fought and died are false, wicked, and against God.”

"To those who look for alternatives to religious expressions: why? Perhaps I don't personally mind because I live in a pretty secular environment, where religious institutions don't influence public rule and mind their business (at least when public scrutiny pays attention). But a lot of people hear ask for replacements to sayings like ""oh my god"" and ""bless you"". It's a recurring topic, I find, on this subreddit. While I understand the wish to stay distant from religious affiliation, censoring oneself doesn't seem to contribute to that. It feels like a linguistic obsession.

I've always taken Freddie Ayer's view on stuff like this:

&gt; ""I won’t utter falsehoods but I have no objection to uttering meaningless statements"".

There are days when I say ""thank/oh my god"" or ""thank/oh my goodness"". I just say ""bless you"" (I know gesundheit exists, but I don't particularly care to notice it). I don't find these expressions harmful, and I think that's to the credit of unbelievers: by stripping these phrases from their original use, they've essentially become lay terms.

"Atheism and attitudes to suicide Something that I've noticed is that atheists tend to have similar attitudes to suicide as theists, as though it was something that is never a rational option (with the exception of terminal illnesses, usually) and consequently should never be allowed.

However, it seems that imbedded in this belief is the assumption that life can be defined as an objective, intrinsic good. For life to be an intrinsic and objective good, that would imply that it was created for a purpose, by a competent and benevolent designer. I can't think of any other way that one would arrive at such a conclusion, and yet anti-suicide atheists act as though it is a given that any rational person ought to choose to live as long as possible.

Part of being an atheist and a skeptic in general is the realisation that, if life was not created by a competent designer, and wasn't created to serve a benevolent purpose, then there's no reason to assume that only those with impaired reasoning abilities would ever conceive of a reason to reject life.

There's also the fact that there's no reason to believe that our consciousness persists in a deprived state after they die. Most atheists are more than happy to say that death will be just the same as before they were born and thus nothing to fear, but if you try to apply that same reasoning to suicide, they then start to protest that somehow, even though your consciousness will be no more, that you'll still somehow be missing out on things that you might have enjoyed had you lived.",atheism,t3_dhb053

"The real ""Ten Commandments"" There are 10 laws (what we now call the ""Ten Commandments"") listed vocally by God in Exodus chapter 20. Read that [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.biblegateway.com/passage/%3fsearch=Exodus%2b20&amp;version=NKJV&amp;interface=amp) if you are unfamiliar. 4 more chapters of laws immediately follow, and then in 24:3-8 we see Moses write the law in a book, and present it to the people as a new covenant. In 24:12, God says he will give Moses stone tablets with the law and commandments. Moses goes up to the mountain for 40 days, while the next few chapters cover the building of the Tabernacle and temple.  
  
Finally, in 32:15-16, we get the classic stone tablets. ""And Moses turned and went down from the mountain, and the two tablets of the Testimony were in his hand. The tablets were written on both sides; on the one side and on the other they were written. 16 Now the tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets."" But oh no! In verse 19 he breaks them out of anger, before the laws are revealed. After a couple chapters, God agrees to make everyone a new set. 34:1 ""And the Lord said to Moses, “Cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and I will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke. ""   
   
And the laws are revealed in verses 17-28. ""17 “You shall make no molded gods for yourselves.  
  
18 “The Feast of Unleavened Bread you shall keep. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, in the appointed time of the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out from Egypt.  
  
19 “All that open the womb are Mine, and every male firstborn among your livestock, whether ox or sheep. 20 But the firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb. And if you will not redeem him, then you shall break his neck. All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.  
  
“And none shall appear before Me empty-handed.  
  
21 “Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest; in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.  
  
22 “And you shall observe the Feast of Weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering at the year’s end.  
  
23 “Three times in the year all your men shall appear before the Lord, the Lord God of Israel. 24 For I will cast out the nations before you and enlarge your borders; neither will any man covet your land when you go up to appear before the Lord your God three times in the year.  
  
25 “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leaven, nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover be left until morning.  
  
26 “The first of the firstfruits of your land you shall bring to the house of the Lord your God. You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.”. 
  
27 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write these words, for according to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” 28 So he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water. And He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments."".

"Rant: Lost sheep don't know they are lost. Yesterday I had an interaction with a friend of my mother that turned me from being agnostic to being a complete atheist because I don't want to have any relation with these people and gave me some perspective in what believing in a God really entails. Right now I'm in college getting a mechanical engineering degree and last semester was the best one by far, so much so that a professor offered me and a friend a project with a local powerplant, this was due to countless sleepless nights and long working hours on the weekends to pay for college (not in the US), this relates because the church group went to my house yesterday to a meeting. I live with my mother and my younger brother, they are both really Christian.
Now for the encounter, this lady came to my room and entered without permission to ""greet me"" and then invited me to the meeting, i politely declined saying I was good in my room and that I didn't want to be bothered but then she started asking why, WHY you ask? well I had to say it and just told her what I thought about religion and how I didn't like the chants and all that praising, well this didn't sit well with her and started telling me how faithful my mother and brother was, and how that faithfulness translated to me because the Lord forgives my indifference since my mom was so faithful, and that since she was so devoted her children were going to do well thanks to gods will. The audacity this b**** had to enter my room, tell me I'm only doing well because of my mother's ""prayings"", that I'm a lost cause because of my ""indifference"" and that lost sheep didn't know they were lost...

"Commentary on Social Media, Family and Civility I just encountered my father posting [this](https://imgur.com/a/NeDF6Uv) little gem on facebook... As pictured I typed in what I wanted to say and took all of my will power not to.  I know well enough  doing so would accomplish nothing.  So I wanted to share a brief commentary on the topic.

**On Social Media:**

Fortunately I've warned my father thoroughly that the facebook algorithm wants to make money, the best way to do that is to increase the number of ads served by increase engagement and the best way to increase engagement is to make you angry.  On that topic I found him frequently locked into an echo chamber of political extremism.  I've repeatedly warned him if the things he sees on facebook make him angry, that's quite on purpose and discouraged him from viewing ""news"" or reposting politically charged content.  But on occasion I still see religious content which while I find it wildly misguided at least comes from a place of positivity.

&amp;#x200B;

**On Family and Civility:**

For a number of years my frustration with religion would kind of boil over to the point I'd actively point out hypocrisy, scientifically demonstrable falsehoods, willful ignorance and general wrong-headed thinking.  But, if there's one thing I can convey to my misguided mindset it's that: **""nobody has ever been insulted into changing their minds""**.  That attacking someone's belief immediately puts them into a defensive mindset and they'll want to fight back without a single thought on if they are right or not and the reason why or why not.

For a while I was implementing the socratic method with my brother.  To kindly and calmly ask questions aimed to make them reach a way of thinking on their own.  It worked so well in a phone conversation with him that one question elicited a period of silence that went on for several minutes where he was unable to answer my question; finally conceding that ""he would have to talk to his pastor"".  Which made me come to the realization that our casual conversations couldn't compete with his complete immersion in a social group that reinforced that belief.  Where while I could guide his mind to a place where he questioned himself, the extreme discomfort caused him to retreat to the comfort of his religion.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the years I've decided that it would take far more time than I could spare to ""reach"" people close to me, if it was at all possible to breach their carefully constructed mental barriers forged in childhood indoctrination... and even if they did genuinely see the world as I do it's unlikely they would be happy that way.  Some people for sure, but not these people in particular.  So, I tend to joke about my frustrations with like-minded close friends or imagine what I'd like to say, but never say it  being an unfruitful breach of civility.

&gt;""Modern secularists dismiss this idea of morality as otherworldly superstition imposed by a killjoy clergy; but, in fact, Judeo-Christian moral standards are the ultimate utilitarian for human conduct,"" Barr said.

"Is taxing churches a good thing or a bad thing? I came across a discussion on twitter that taxing churches would only give them further legitimacy in political races and enable them to influence public opinion since they’re not acting as a charity anymore. Is this true? Would taxing churches give them more power and violate the separation of church vs State? It seems that people are conflating the means of that and think if you tax churches that removes separation of church and state and then religion becomes a part of the government.

Is there any way to debunk this?",atheism,t3_dh119a
"Why do atheists cite Europe as the poster child for secular atheism? I saw a post condemning Prince Charles for visiting the vatican when when an English priest was named a saint as an embarrassment for a mostly secular nation. This came off as incredibly odd to me. The UK is officially not secular but quite the opposite. The state religion is the Church of England, the head of state is also the head of church and their anthem is “God Save the Queen” and the Queen’s title is “Defender of the faith”. You can show me statistics that most british aren’t religious but none of that really matters as officially the country is not secular

Another explain is scandinavia when again mostly not secular. Besides Sweden Norway and Denmark are both theocracies like England with state religions, Sweden only became secular in 2000. All their constitutions mention God and their flags all feature a cross. If putting God on money is bad how is this conveniently overlooked?

I also think Europe is a terrible example of why secular atheism is a good thing nationwide as they’ve all been officially religious far longer than they have been secular meaning their culture and ideals directly derived from religion. Those universal healthcare you hear about originated from the church. The fancy paintings and music also religion. You can’t avoid in religion because it’s part of their DNA.

They just don't see religion as an important topic, what with all the corruption, ambition and vindictiveness going on in Washington. But IMO, I really believe that nothing will change until they do start to acknowledge the intense hold that belief in religion has on the minds of the conservative movement. They ascribe their every thought and decision to inspiration from God. And so they believe that listening to other viewpoints is really and truly Satanic.

"How do atheists rationalize morality? I am a Christian, but I have an immense respect for people who have made up their minds about their personal beliefs. That is to say, if a man tells me he’s an atheist, I’m not going to try to evangelize to him unless he makes it clear that he’s interested in changing his mind. However, I do think that poking holes in each other’s world views is a good thing because it causes us to think critically about our perspectives and learn from each other.

With that being said, I’m interested to hear from this subreddit in regards to how an atheist can rationalize morality and virtue. I often hear atheists say, “we don’t need a man in the sky to tell us right from wrong.” So, the logical question becomes: where does your sense of right and wrong come from? How do you justify a sense of morality at all? If there is no transcendent good or evil, then right and wrong are entirely subjective and dependent on personal perspective. And even then, the perspective of the moral atheist has no actual grounding in reality, because there isn’t any objective reason why one might consider one thing immoral and another thing moral.

"Strong or Positive ""Atheism"" should be renamed to ?theism Apologies if this has been discussed before; I'm not that active in Athiest circles but haven't heard it where I have been. And I am not a philosopher nor a linguist, just a person questioning the basic ideas and practicality.

Theism currently covers the positive belief in some diety(s), whereas Atheism covers both the lack of belief in diety(s) (weak atheism) and active and total disbelief or positive belief in a universe with no diety(s) (strong atheism).

These are the roots:

**a-**

Not, without, opposite of

**theos**

(religion) god or deity

**-ism**

Used to form names of a tendency of behaviour, action, state, condition or opinion belonging to a class or group of persons, or the result of a doctrine, ideology or principle or lack thereof

...

The problem is that this is theistic-centric and does not actually divide on the same level. We could argue that theism and strong atheism should make a group divided from weak atheism first for both being positive beliefs just as well.

A philosophically equal divide would be: positive(diety) lack(either) positive(none), each to the point/purpose of the beliefs themselves. From the roots and dominant use, Atheism makes the most sense as the lack of belief overall only, fulfilling lack(either) and leaving ?theism for positive(none).

Atheism would necessarily lack belief **either way** for both a diety and a universe absent. Even if I have a highly skewed assessment of probability from the evidence in favor of none, that does not change that actual, positive belief is still lacking. And of course the question of disbelief in *specific* dieties is separate from *a* diety.

And as a lack of belief in something is a precursor for disbelief, even fitting ?theism _under_ Atheism is redundant on top of being not to the point.

Nontheist would be the best prefix I know of, but unfortunately that has been taken. So I'm not sure what could fulfill the ?- for positive disbelief.

Thoughts? Alternative perspective? Something I've missed which could change my perspective?

I do also think a change in language here would be an especially beneficial start for theists and those already outside it but unsure. Even considering most are weak atheists anyways, I feel this would more clearly differentiate in conversation for those less apt to understanding. It almost reminds me of the issues with scientific theory vs colloquial theory. Yes, willfully ignorant people will continue being so, but at least we can try to best remove language from being a tool to spread it. Comments on that welcome.

"“Gods not dead” is a horrible movie and is actually Christian Propaganda I’m an atheist but when I was younger my dad was Christian and our local church made us watch the movie for service one day

It starts off with a dickhead professor who makes his students write “God is dead” if they want to take his class which is dumb and discriminatory and yada yada kid stands up to him you get the gist.

**Spoilers if you care to watch the movie yourself for whatever reason:**

At the end of the movie the atheist professor is killed in a car crash and this is where it gets fucky. Guess who’s the first witness to the accident. Yep, it’s our good little Christian boy protagonist. And you know what he does to help? You know what he does to help this person, who although was a dickhead was still a person who had people that cared about him? Does he call an ambulance? Does he try to comfort the professor?

Nope. He pressures him into believing in god until he gives up in his final moments and “converts.” First off, he absolutely did not convert, he probably just wanted one last shred of hope as he died. And second, what the fuck? It’s his last moment and you tell him “Do you believe in god?” That’s fucking awful. How would you feel if a Muslim said “Do you trust Allah?”.

Also I did research after writing that first piece and apparently he wasn’t just an atheist, he was was an atheist because “he hated god for killing his mother”, which is honestly the most bullshit reasoning I have ever heard.

Annecdotally speaking, i know what its like to be an edgelord, because I used to be one. i know edgelords masquerading as social justice warriors when i see them. many young adults nowadays think that its edgy or somehow bad ass to criticize white christians and propagate godlessness. However, It really seems like theyre choosing the easiest target. Christianity preaches non violence and to treat others like you would treat yourself. It is reiterated countlessly in the bible. theyre axioms.  But rarely do I see open criticism on islam in these subreddits. Islam is violence. jihad is to wage war literally. They throw gays from rooftops. They decapitate in public, in front of children. They seek out disension and eliminate it physically. They rape and disfigure women. This is a small sector of islam extremeism and obviously not reflective of all muslims, but so are the instances of christian hate in r/againsthatesubreddits; and in the case of the later, the instances of extremeism really do seem like a kid weilding a stick versus a man with a , dare i say, bomb. Whens the last time youve heard of white christians publicly executing non believers? I beleive at the extreme ends of the spectrum, burning a book isnt nearly as horrible as burning a gay. Slack isnt distributed proportionally. Its trendy to criticize christians now. And I cant help but think that its because theres some subconscious aversion to criticizing Islam because of its inherently violent nature. Islam in its extreme form conjures images of lopped off heads and melted faces when really scares the piss out of anyone. So they think about it less. There's always forethought of consequences when addressing Islam. It's asking 'will they find me cut my head off if I say this?'. It's making sure to educate anyone and everyone around you that not all muslims are violent, but simultaneously preaching that all Christians are despicable. Critics of extreme islam are calculated, and rightfully so. But when criticizing white christian america there is no restraint. No mercy. No benefit of the doubt. Not every muslim is jihadi john, but neither is every christian a crusader. At the end of the day, if youre going to criticize religion, dont be a pussy and stick to the nerd that cant fight back.

"If someone was raped, and I can save them without any risk of myself being hurt, but I choose to just watch, am I an asshole? **If I am an asshole, then why is it acceptable for God?**


My previous post was deleted for low effort, so here's some content. 

I have experimented the wording of this thread a few times. I like this because this bring discussion of moral and freewill into a different position, a different view. Usually when talking about problem of evil here's what happen :

Atheist : why there's suffering?

Theist : because if God interfere there'll no freewill!

And then you can guess what the atheist and theist say after that. 

However by asking ""am I the asshole for letting someone being raped?"". The flow is different. Now you have to find an excuse to make God not an asshole. Because most theist not only believe God exists, but also believe God is omnibenevolent, an all good being. Obviously nobody want their God to be labeled as an asshole.

I got some respond throughout my experiments, here's the respond and my reply :

&gt;Theist : ""God gave human freewill""

Okay I'll let the rapist exercise his God-given freewill.

&gt;Theist : ""God created hell for that""

Well human created jail for that

&gt;Theist : ""if God interfere there'll be no freewill""

I can kick the rapist in the crotch, it doesn't affect much of rapist's freewill, but liberate the victim's freewill I am sure God can do that.

&gt;Theist : ""if God make rapist's crotch hurt each time they try to rape someone then human won't rape because scared, not because they think it's bad""

Then I should let the rapist rape, I shouldn't kick the rapist's crotch, what if the rapist stop raping forever because he's scared of being kicked in the crotch? *gasp what a nightmare

&gt;Theist: ""why would God help human? He isn't slave of human!"" 

Well I am not slave of other human too. Beside that, police risking their life to help other people's life, God can do that without risk. Don't be so egoistic God, I am sure you are omnipotent. 


See? Now the discussion centers around a single small case, pretty neat and controllable. And I can bring the discussion back to the analogy easily.

"Living with religious parents and afraid of being kicked out I am an atheist, but I cannot tell my parents under any circumstances as whenever I make statements regarding any sort of independent thought, my mother, in particular, is very quick to try and kick me out. For example, if I have a different political opinion, she gets incredibly heated. 

I'm dating a young man and he isnt Christian either, and my parents have a laundry list of complaints, which I'm able to answer to or deflect except when religion is brought up. I want to tell them so badly that I dont believe anymore, but I know that will make me homeless in a heartbeat, as if they kick me out for atheism, I cannot live with my equally religious grandparents, and I barely have family as it is.

I walk on eggshells with how controlling they are and while I have gotten better with standing my ground, sometimes I feel my ""ground"" is on the edge of the cliff and I'm afraid I do not have the means to land safely.

"Religious coworkers: a rant I just feel very alienated at work sometimes. During lunch yesterday my manager kept saying how she can't understand how you can even be a ""full person"" unless you have at least some belief in one God in your life. Everyone nodded and agreed except for me and another coworker who, while though goes to church, isn't at all pushy about it and knows I'm an atheist. 

I kinda wanted to say something but I'm currently struggling with a relapse in my depression and didn't want to hear about how its caused by the lack of Jesus in my life. So I'm not the best example of a well adjusted completely successful atheist. 

The good thing is that once when a coworker suggested we do a morning prayer together my main boss rolled his eyes and dismissed the idea completely. She remarked how we should do it because we are all followers of Jesus Christ. I remained silent. 

I had previously opened up to one coworker about my depression when she caught me crying in the breakroom and boy that was a mistake. The onslaught of bible verses via text began (but have now stopped). 

I don't particularly care if they are religious I just don't want it at work, esp bc if they knew the real me they would either 1) buckle down and try to convert me or 2) just be more distant bc they would think I'm a terrible person who is going to hell.

"Why do Muslims kill each other? 
I posted this below, what I considered, a  serious question on :/Islamic but it was rejected:- 

Although not condoning it I can sort of  could understand Muslims wanting to kill Americans, Brits etc etc for supposed past crimes. However Muslims just seem to kill each other, no Muslim country is peaceful, no Muslim country is without corruption and no Muslim (or any other religous) country is wealthy or secular, oil excepted. I tried to ask an Iman a few weeks ago about this and he only started going on about the second world war.
Globally Islam appears to be completely incompatible with a secular, peaceful, democratic way of life, even Turkey is now killing other Muslims along with heading down a tyrannical path.
I just fail to understand why people of Islam seem intent on killing their own other believers.
Also given the choice when people of the faith are migrants why do they always and I repeat always wish to migrate to secular, democratic countries Germany, UK, USA, Canada, Australia etc. I don't see many wishing to go to Saudi, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia in fact they are normallyescaping those countries.

I’ve been trying to find anything on the subjects of NDEs from a non theist standpoint but every result I find is about some religious person seeing their own religious ideologies. 

And while I do believe that there is a chance that each of these are true through logical means (the whole brain losing oxygen and seeing whatever they have the most comfort with yadayada) I also think there’s a chance that maybe an afterlife is a probability. Not a definitive thing but a probable scenario.

Either way, the closest answer I got to this was a religious guy who said he nearly drowned to death. He said he experienced a period of awareness, but he was entirely at peace. Like he knew he was dead or dying but it didn’t matter in that state because he was in a state of serenity I guess.

"No one becomes an atheist because they hate god for doing this or not doing that; people simply misinterpret when a person realizes the futility for believing in divine beings Well, it’s just a random though I came up while thinking about an incident I had the other day while telling how I became an atheist.

As a kid, I wasn’t the most devout Catholic, and had a lot of doubts about many things. When I was 8, my grandmother got a very aggressive form of liver cancer and died. My family didn’t lie to me, and I did “what I could to help”. Years of studying in a catholic school taught me that “god listened to god kids” and that “miracles exist”; so I prayed in tears and offered several “acts of penitence” in exchange for a miracle.

As you might imagine, she died as expected, and I had a lot of questions, like “wasn’t there a better option to achieve god’s plans without killing my grandma?” or “why god couldn’t spare a miracle?”.

Was I angry with god? Yes, I was, but only until I began doubting it’s existence. Once I realized there was no one there, I understood that there are things that happen without a purpose and that I have no control over them. Basically, it became obvious that all the effort praying, the anxiety for the miracle not occurring, and those acts of penitence (like dressing in white, not playing or watching tv, spending a whole afternoon on my knees) were useless.

In the end, the only complains I had left, was not realizing sooner that I was angry for no reason; and that its stupid to think that something good comes from the death of a beloved person.",atheism,t3_dgha2s

"Reasons of why you don't believe? I would like to talk with a close person to me who is a Christian. He doesnt't believe everything related to religion, he understands evolution, big bang, hates priest pedophilia (which is not related to religion, people are people), taking money from poor people for salvation. In my opinion he is a smart believer. He goes to church every sunday, doesn't eat meet on friday, want sex after the wedding, prays everyday before sleep for couple of minutes. All of that for his mental health and purity. Believes in God and that all of that he does will grant him a better place in afterlife. I would like to talk with him about my view on life, why I think that it's unlikely to be a God that we can imagine (i'm an agnostic, I think that maybe there is some kind of higher power that we can't understand, but I dont't think that it is something that any person believes in now) and most likely we can't know what he wants from us and our lives. That christianity doesn't have any proofs beside bible which can't be supported with any other source. That even the second most believed religion (islam) contradicts with christianity on Jesus being son of God and dying for our sins and they also think that their way of thinking is the right one and have a holy book to prove that as well. 

My question is do you have some sources for inside bible contradictions or with other religions. Some sources on why believing and sacrificing your life to go to church every week or waiting for sex till mariage is not a good thing and he should think by himself what is important for him since it's his one and only life. Maybe philosophical questions I should ask him like, why is that religion that you are brought by in is always the true and only one, or how is that people for thousand years before Jesus came to earth believed in a huge number of other things, and if someone doesn't believe what he think is right what is going to happen to those people?

Please provide me some sources so I can better articulate my believes and maybe try to make him think outside religion without making him feel super bad and not offend him too much in the process. Thank you.",atheism,t3_dgxysw

&gt;While this story time is ostensibly meant to introduce children to new ideas and open their minds, it is clear that the events skew in a particular political direction.

Why teach children facts when they can learn left-wing talking points instead?

They asked me to look at Daniel 9 and Isaiah 53 which both predict semi-specific things about the story of Jesus and are, I think, provably written well before. I tried to do my research, but came up with very little.  I'll detail the specifics later in the comments, but in the end it came out with them having an answer for most of my objections, which honestly were all pretty good.  The whole thing was respectful and honest, but I ended up having to say I was stumped and needed to do more research.

I try to never hold a position that I can't defend, but I'm just way out of my depth here on historical and biblical knowledge.  Can anyone help me with some context here?

"I'm no longer a Christian and I have no idea what to do about it I'm copy and pasting from my post on r/Advice, a very kind reddit user directed me to this subreddit for better insight! I'm fairly new to reddit and I'll just ask for a bit of patience.

some warnings! If you don't like reading about homophobia, religion, and anxiety, please feel free not to read!

Also please forgive any spelling mistakes and grammar issues, school/college is over for the day and I really can't be bothered.

I've never been truly a super religious person the way a lot of people I know are. I mostly prayed for salvation because I wanted to drink grape juice and eat those crackers during communion. I was also four and there is a shame/fear tactic around not accepting Jesus in the church, or at least the one I grew up in. I've had what some people might call spiritual callings to strengthen my faith, but every time I've tried to do so, I've only grown more doubtful. As a result, I decided to try and prove to myself that the Bible is true through means other than ""it's true because God says it is."" Something I've learned in composition course in college when trying to convince someone of something (in this case, myself), is to find counterarguments and defend your position against them.

That was the start of my more dramatic (I don't think that's the word I was looking for, but it will do) disbelief.

I started looking into atheist content (as well as other political views). To my growing anxiety and horror, I found myself agreeing more and more with channels such as Mr Atheist (although he grew up in the Church of Latter Day Saints instead of Baptist denominations). The more I've felt myself distancing from Christian faith, the more at peace I am with my own worldview. I've never been able to fully reconcile my own sexuality (I'm bi/pan by the way, labels don't really concern me in that regard) with the Bible and what I believed to be God's nature. The conflicting nature of ""you can judge someone by their 'fruits' (actions) but don't judge, that's God's job,"" and other such messages really bothered me. The extreme guilt I felt over my own anxiety (""if you're ever anxious, clearly you're just not trusting God enough"") only ever fed my anxiety to an unhealthy degree. My ""role"" as a woman, how we follow some rules in the Old Testament but not others, the hypocritical nature of many 'good' examples of Christians, and just how disgusting I feel about a lot of Republican views that are supported by the Bible, really only further pushed my disbelief. There are so many other ideals held up by Christian belief that I can't stand. I would like to make the disclaimer that there are some morals that I do still believe in, but this isn't the post to talk about those.

I don't regret my choice to stop believing in the bible, and ""throw away"" my faith. I cannot call myself a Christian when so many values go strictly against everything I believe to be true about the world and myself and the nature of humanity. However, I feel like I'm betraying everyone I care about. I live a double life, in so many senses. I live my performance life, where I'm a good Christian girl who can defend the Bible (with what I personally think are weak arguments) and had a brief ""phase"" of rebellion where I was ""just seeking affection everywhere possible."" Yes, that's what my family has decided me 'being' into other genders was, and what I let them believe for fear of awful consequences. Everyone thinks I read my bible daily, that I pray over everything, that I want to be a good, submissive wife and raise good Christian children and go to a good christian college and attempt to influence other people into following this religion that I've always had one foot out of. I also live my secret life, in my head, where I don't believe in so many things I used to and constantly feel guilt and anxiety over everything. There's not one person I can confess this to without fear of it accidentally being shared to someone who could cause me a lot of really bad consequences. I don't even want to schedule an appointment with my therapist, because I have to go through my mother to do so and I don't want to raise any suspicion in her that something is ""wrong"" with me.

I've been crying myself to sleep on and off for months because of how much I'm lying to everyone around me. A semi-anonymous post about it is some of the only relief I have. I'm really looking forward to growing as a person and learning to stop falling into some things I was taught. Internalized homophobia being a huge one for me, but I'm also trying to learn how to not immediately judge people, how to stop feeling guilty over things that aren't my fault, how to stop hating myself, and how to treat other people better than I have been.

I hope that this post expressed some of my thoughts the way I was thinking them, I'm not very good at getting across what I want to say.

"Is it really common for us heretics to have this zest for to engage in debates with other people? And more specifically, when such a debate is about religions and correlated subjects? So today I saw that post where our fellow redditor [insert name] commented about having watched a debate between Sam Harris and [insert other guy's name]. This brought back to my mind these quite old questions I now finally asked you.

It seems to me that debating (broadly speaking) is quite a recurring subject here, and this put me to wonder if we heretics are somewhat prone to share this zest for to engage in debates with other people, and for to challenge ourselves to reason coherently about a given matter. By wondering about it, I realized that my (atheist) friends also seem to be always ready for a good debate, which makes me think there may be some connection between the lack of faith in deities, and the zest to debate.

While I'm not particularly fond to debates, this doesn't mean I don't like them – on the contrary, although it depends heavily on the subject to be debated. For instance, religion is generally a big turn-off for me, but you can always count me in for politics, law, and football (soccer).

The thing was, we didn't want religion to be part of it. We wanted to start a place where families, or anyone really, could come and just talk and hangout. We wanted a daycare where your kids would be taught life lessons and just how to be a good person. And a place where you felt like you belonged because you wanted to be a good person and be good to anyone and everyone around you. We talked about tithe and how the only thing we'd use it for other than keeping the doors open was going around and helping people fix things they couldn't on their own. Or going as a group to help out those that couldn't for themselves. 

We wanted conversation to be about how to take the next step in life and what we, as a group, could do to get you there.

"Religion and Science Classes I’ve always wondered why religious kids take classes that are completely against their beliefs. I take an AP biology class with about 70% extremely religious peers i’ve grown up with, and they’re all just jackasses about their religion. My bio teacher asked us who we got our mitochondria from, our mom or our dad. The girl behind me raised her hand and confidently said “Jesus”. Obviously my teacher looked annoyed, but other kids were nodding and she kept assuring everyone around her it was Jesus. Our two biggest units in the class are evolution and vaccinations...why are these kids even here? There’s an obvious option to take other classes...and to top everything off, there are literally kids that will tell the teacher they can’t do an assignment because their religion is against the subject, and the teacher has to give them an A while everyone else has to do the work.........

TL;DR: My bio class has religious kids that are against the subjects we learn and I don’t understand why they’re there.

"How to deal with religious parents concerning abortion For some context, my parents don't know I'm an atheist. I never really planned on telling them because they're so religious. I never really agreed to their beliefs even as a kid but I went along with it because I was told I was supposed to. They always frustrate me because I can't even ask a question without the answer including god.

I found out only a couple of days ago at my 20-week ultrasound that the baby has a few birth defects. The doctor came in and said in a few details the baby has spina bifida. We later learned that there was also something wrong with the brain. Information was slowly fed to us the past couple of days so we'd learn a little bit more about what's going on every day. Then, just yesterday we learned the hole was a large size, exposing 5 vertebrae, and that brain matter was falling into the hole. The doctor can't give any type of guarantee legally but he said he's 95% sure that the brain issue would cause some types of mental illnesses.

The doctor explained to us they could only fix the hole but the damage has already been done. Nothing could fix paralyzation (I'm not a doctor and I don't know if this matters but the legs weren't moving in the ultrasound.) He said there was a surgery I could do while the baby was still in utero, but it still wouldn't fix the brain or paralyzation. Also, I would have to go to Philidelphia for the surgery ( I live in Maine.) And with 2 other toddlers, that's not an option for us.

My husband and I decided to terminate the pregnancy. (Which isn't done yet, it's scheduled for either Saturday or early next week.) We decided with the high odds, we didn't want to subject a baby to a life of pain, who may not even have the mental capacity to understand what the world is. We wanted this baby but we wanted to have a happy life of peace which unfortunately won't happen. So we decided on termination.Now, my parents are causing me more stress because they don't believe in abortion. They think that all the ultrasounds are wrong and that it's ""baby killing democrats agenda.""

I tried to say that no one wants to have to give this news. And medical proffessionals are all trained to not discriminate health care based on politics, or gender or anything.

they think some miracle is going to happen. Like because they prayed about it they'll check again and nothing will be wrong. They think its part of God's plan. and then my mom's like ""if the baby does die then it's because God wants you to get closer to him"" And proceded to tell me a story about a man in the bible who was sent to a mountain to kill his son because god said so.

She also keeps sending me testimony's of her church friends who were given the same diagnosis but their child is in grade school and walking. Which is great for those people. But I've also heard horror stories of this disease. They keep saying ""don't believe them"" ""how do they know."" ""They just want to kill babies.""

I just don't believe in God and no amount of praying will change the baby's diagnosis. We decided this based on the information we were given and what we think is best. Bottom line is we are thinking about the baby.

The past week has been so emotional, and upsetting. I'm getting information and ""facts"" from all directions and it's muddling with my thoughts and my grieving.

I guess what Im asking is has any one gone through this? Will they ever accept this decision? I'm worried they'll just forever look at me a different way because of it. There is so much conflicting information out there, this decision is hard enough without my religious (christian) parents judging me for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you, everyone, that responded and for the condolences. I know you all are right about I can't change their opinions and if that changes then I guess I can't do anything about it. I feel like I'm making the right decision. If I had any doubts at all then I wouldn't make this choice. It's something I don't think she understands. She called me up making me upset about the situation all over them, trying to guilt me using my dead grandmother and what she would have wanted. She says they're all agreeing with the midwife because she's a democrat. And that just because one doctor saw on the ultrasound doesn't mean another doctor won't agree. I think the doctor knows what he's talking about and wouldn't cause grief on someone for no reason. She wants me to drive to Ohio for a second opinion. The doctor explained to me the damage is irreversible and life long no matter what kind of surgery happens. Anyway, I explained I'm having the procedure on Saturday and she said: ""so you're going to watch a doctor crush your baby's skull."" Man, wtf? I said that's not what's going to happen. And she just said ""you'll see."" and hangs up on me. I don't know what's going to happen in terms of my relationship with my mother but, a lot of you are right a distance is needed for this situation.

"I don't understand religious people.... Hey Guys, recently i've been thinking about the close-mindedness of religious people. I remember when I was younger, maybe 9 or 10 years old a group of Jehovah's Witness came to my house and I happily invited them to come and speak to me because at that time I was a firm believer in God and the whole doctrine.

I remember being there and while they were speaking to me about how amazing God and his creations are, I stopped and asked ""wait if God created all of this, then where did he come from?"" They both smiled and simply said ""Well our God is infinite, the bible says that our creator has no beginning or end, he has always been around outside of space and time"" and at that moment it made perfect sense to me because I wasn't quite at the stage to fully question it all as yet.

However as i grew older and gave up on all those beliefs, I've realised how much religious groups ridicule people that believe in evolution because they don't believe something this complex could come from nothing, but yet they're trying to tell me that there God that ""has no beginning or end"" constructed all of this?

I for one don't lean towards the creationists side of things because I don't think the answers to our ""creation"" lies within a book that can be so easily disproved with mere rational thinking. 

Evolution is obviously the more logical answer if you were to ask me, simply because there's so much more evidence and the more you read and just simply observe your surroundings you'd find what I like to call ""Plot Holes"" in every creation story known to man.

Now i want to know if you've ever asked a religious person that quesion, if yes then what was their response? and how did you respond to the answer you got? 

I simply just don't think religious people are in any position to judge people that opposes creationism because telling me that ""our creator has no beginning or end"" is just a sexed up way of telling me that they simply can't explain it because it's a fictional story or ""YES!

"Jesus evidently I explained how there is no evidence of Jesus outside the Bible and this is what someone said. Each numbered point is my point along with a response from that person.

1.There is actually no evidence that Jesus or the crucifixion existed.

This is inaccurate. The vast majority of scholars contend that, at the very least, Jesus of Nazareth was a real person, a first century religious leader, who was apparently executed, either for ""blasphemy"" or for attempting to incite a rebellion against the Roman authorities.



2.Historians have found that the Gospels were written decades after the supposed events occurred.

No one questions this, even the Christian church. But they were still written during a time in which many of Jesus' followers were still alive. And much of the New Testament (the letters of Paul, Peter, etc.) were written even earlier than the Gospels.

3.No contemporary evidence during that time period.

Do you mean outside of the Bible? There are Roman records of very early Christians refusing to denounce their beliefs, even in the face of execution. It was those refusals that motivated Roman officials to record this, since it was so odd.

So you can't certainly question Jesus' deity, but you can't deny his existence or the existence of his followers at the time.",atheism,t3_dgibe9

"An Agnostic-Atheist's Controversial Rant Notice: This has been edited. This original post is written by a dumbass who hasn't had his Vyvanse in 34 days. 

I expect a lot of shit being thrown at me, similar to those evangelicals who change whatever they believe in to appeal to non-believers. (I'm referring to bid'ah)

Hello.

I am someone who doesn't believe in a deity, but I refuse to count out the possibility. (Agnostic-Atheist) 

Our solution to all problems, my best friend and probably yours, too, Science, hasn't ruled out a deity nor has proved one.

Atheism is a non-belief in a diety.

Agnosticism is indecision in faith due to a lack of knowledge. (wow I'm an idiot for confusing this with skepticism)

Skepticism is the questioning of one's beliefs, based usually upon a scientific standpoint, but can also be on moral contradictions.

I find it only logical to question but not rule out an existence of a diety. If a diety doesn't exist, we should be able to prove that it doesn't exist. If a diety does exist, we should be able to prove that it does exist. (this is faulty; see unicorn theory)

Although... I have a theory.

Deities are a social construct that are used to keep people from being lawless, the super lazy way.
However, this theory assumes that the lawless are nonbelievers; I find this contradicting to real life, as I believe in furthering my race, the Human race, which itself has certain rules that restrict me from being a cunt. This theory also assumes every faithful person is lawful, which is untrue in the same manner, more or less. 

This leads me to this new theory, which I haven't disproven yet.

Humans who don't restrict themselves behaviorally can and maybe will do things that hinder the Race. (this is iffy --- it's extremely situational, but it is extremely general; a contradiction)

That is my best theory for getting to the bottom of theism. (from a Sunni-influenced perspective, seeing holy books as books of guidance [Qur'an], as diaries [Vedic Texts, Old Testament], or as stories [New Testament])

Tell me what you think; an association of people is usually better than a single person.

Edit: wow that unicorn thing has me thinking

There's no way a deity can exist unless it shows itself to us, like the unicorn, dragon, or whatever the like.

"I’m beginning to notice it’s only the pro life crowd has this mentality of “the day you turn 18 you’re out” or, even better, “if you have a kid before you turn 18 you’re out”. Living in the bible belt (I had to re-lowercase that ten times, thanks autocorrect) I have heard these two phrases more times than I can count. I’m sure most people from America know a very, very large part of the population of the southern states are conservative pro life christians. They are also very quick to throw their own children out and be rid of them by the time they turn 18. They are quick to tell their own children that if they themselves get pregnant or get a girl pregnant, they will be kicked out then as well. 

What this says to me, is that you never really planned on having these kids to begin with. And that if your conscience allowed it, you would have aborted them instead. You would think that being pro life would entail improving the “life” of your own children. Not saying fuck you the day they turn 18. Not saying fuck you to your own grandchild. 

Until the day I can’t answer it anymore, my door will be open to my kids. If they become addicts or alcoholics, I will be there to help them recover. If they need groceries for the week because the light bill was too much, I’ll pitch in what I can if I can. If I live to see my grandchildren, I’d hope I could see them every single day. Not put them on the street. Who the fuck does that to a baby? 

I guess that’s the difference between pro life and pro choice..... go figure.",atheism,t3_dfmuqj

"Why I think polytheism make more sense More of a rant than an actual argument but whatever.

So why do I prefer the idea of polytheism over monotheism? And why should it matter if I'm an atheist? Well let me explain. 

The problem with monotheism is in the name, a single god often if not always ""perfect"" 

And just like that a billion holes in your religion shows up
""if your god is perfect why is there so much pain?"" 
""if he has all powers and he knows everything what's the point of prayers? Doesn't he already know all of this?and if it's a thing to show to god you"" care"" God would already kno-""

You get the idea, the problem of a perfect god is we live in an unperfect world. 

But polytheism gets rid of all these logical fallacies. Well most of them anyway, because Gods in polytheists religion aren't perfect, they make mistake, and it would make sense that unperfect gods would make our world. 

But that's not all, in most polytheistic religion there's a god for a certain thing, but you don't HAVE to pray to all of them, just pray to the God of wine when drinking or to the god of harvest when you'r doing farm work, if you don't you won't get a favour, no biggies.

What does the monotheist God do? He Forces you to pray to him or you get eternal suffering or limbo if you'r lucky. 
Wow, I didn't know the all good all forgiving perfect being was such a NARCISSISTIC PRICK. 

But then why? Why did monotheist religion ended up Destroying polytheistic religion in term of popularity? 

Simple, it's easier to manipulate. 
If you are a prophet choosing one of the many god is necessary, and you will only cater to the people that are interested in the thing this god represents. Now wouldn't it be convenient if you mixed up all God's in the same thing so you can just say ""I speak for the one and only true God everyone listen to me"" 

It's just so much more efficient at controlling the masses isn't it? 

Now I'm not saying that all polytheist religion are perfect, and not that all monotheist religion are about a perfect God. But if I had to choose a type of religion I wouldn't go for the narcissistic pretentious and somewhat childish ""one and only God"" 

Anyway thank you for coming to my red talk

Edit : I thought I'd make a few things clear seeing a lot of the comments assume that I'm  a polytheist or planning to be, the answer is no, never. 
I'll be an atheist until the day gods will be scientifically proven, so probably until I die.
What I was trying to say through this post is that polytheism made more sense to me like one would discuss fiction, as atheists we can discuss religion like it is, myths and a cultural phenomenon. And polytheism is much more interesting in that regard to me.

Now the comments were varied and I actually kind of like that, in a way it really shows how differently people react to the mention of religion or the idea of someone being religious. Anyway, moral of the story is, don't be a dumbass like me and actually reread yourself before posting something so you don't get any misunderstanding.",atheism,t3_dfw42h
"We're on the precipice of potentially discovering life on Mars. My parents made a good point that if we did, Christian fundamentalists would probably go nuts Very by-the-book Christians, and most Christians in general, would go out of their minds if we proved that life existed on another planet. A fundamental concept of the Bible would be rendered completely false. It couldn't even really be reinterpreted. Sure, some people will come to accept that the Bible is a manmade book of stories that loosely pontificate on greater metaphysical ideas and shouldn't be taken literally, but frankly most won't do this. My parents believe that real Bible thumpers would potentially commit acts of terror if they learned that we weren't the only lifeforms in the Universe. My parents therefore said we'd be better off not knowing. They'd personally want to know, but they think that there are too many crazy people who would do crazy shit that what we could gain would be lost by what we could lose. 

I definitely agree that Christian fundamentalists could go insane and be dangerous if we figured this out, but honestly, if they commit an act of violence as a result of learning a fact that disrupts their fantasy about reality, they should genuinely be killed. I say to hell with them, march forward, and let the law enforcement beat them to a pulp or kill them if they try anything.",atheism,t3_dfrz1h

"I posted in askachristian about the hypocrisy of cherry picking certain laws like homosexuality but not laws like wearing mixed fabric and eating shrimp They responded that those laws about mixed fabrics and eating dirty animals were specifically for Jewish people and that the Old Testament covenant was overturned once Jesus came and made a new covenant. They also said that the rules about sexuality and premarital sex were for everyone not just the Jews so it’s not ‘cherry picking’

What’s the best response to this? I mean I kind of find it funny Jesus died for the Jews so they wouldn’t have to follow the old covenant meanwhile they don’t even believe Jesus was the messiah so they still follow it anyway.

Edit: wow I am so sick of Christians defending their shitty religion with mental gymnastics. It’s clear they will twist bend or interpret their scripture to sound the least bad so they can justify it to appease other people’s questions.

"So tired of the pro-lifers these days Don’t tell me you’re pro-life when you’re actually just “pro-human”. Because I bet a large majority of these “pro-lifers” do one or more of the following:

2. Eat meat (including baby animals like veal)
3. Eat eggs
4. Use any form of birth control
5. Advocate the death penalty
6. Would kill a man who was attacking you and/or your family
7. Kills insects or rodents just for being in their house
8. Wears fur

Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.

"Atheist friend bullied by Christians I was in lunch at school and I don't remember how it came up, but one of my fellow students casually admitted to being an Atheist to a group of mostly Christians. All of the Christians at the table immediately started making fun of him, calling him ""gaythiest,"" (his name was gabe) and tried to push there belief on him by telling him he was going to go to hell. The whole time Gabe was respectful to all of them, and never insulted them or their beliefs.

"i just met the wildest person at my dorm i'm genuinely kind of freaked out right now. 

i met this girl a few days ago and she seemed pretty sweet. really friendly but sort of... out of it? she had this slow, trance-like way of talking, but i didn't think much of it.

i'm going to wash my clothes and i run into her. we talk for a bit and i tell her i'm writing a book. it's a fantasy book. i start to explain the plot and as soon as i mention elves, fairies, etc, she just starts.

she starts by telling me that fairies are real and butterflies are a type of fairy. that was pretty weird to me but i just smiled and nodded. then she started insisting mermaids were real as well. she told me her mum has ""visions"" from God and that she had a dream she was on a ship and she saw the queen of mermaids, and an angel came to save her.

she also told me her mum saw an evil spirit walking near her house and she told it to leave.

she said her mum was writing a book about it all. by now i was very uncomfortable but was still trying to listen.

then she goes ""don't be scared, we're all Christians here! we're children of God. the people who should be worried are atheists, you know. they're all already in trouble.""

at this point i tried to leave politely to wash, but she followed me. gave me her Bible to read a passage and it's still in my lap right now. i'm just. . . baffled. and very worried, honestly.",atheism,t3_dfmuoz
